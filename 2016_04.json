Again, this is not unheard of in production art, but people are going to see it grouped with some of his paintings and assume it's all the same.\nEven the ones that look entirely painted look like they could be done from reference. \n\nIn the end, it's not that I'm saying he has zero skill, but I think people should know the difference between hand painted and composited. I don't think he's even misrepresenting his own work, but unfortunately some people do, and it really waters down the level of skill and knowledge it takes to do that sort of work from imagination.\n\n**edit:** I reworded my last paragraph because the way I wrote it was communicating the wrong opinion.","score":"255","subreddit":"Art"}

{"body":"Ayahuasca really should be considered it's own completely separate substance. IMO anyways.. \n\nThe reason I say that is because Ayahuasca has many dimensions to it, not just the bit that you will get from the DMT. Imagine if DMT is the rocket ride into space.. Then imagine that Ayahuasca is that, plus a trip to the end of the universe and back. There is so much more to it. \n\nYour experience may differ but here is an account of some of mine for reference.\n\nIn my Ayahuasca experience I went through 4 phases... I did it solo while listening to a queue of about 12 hours of random Shamanic Icaros on youtube. Total time from ingestion to going to bed was about 6-8 hours. I took twice the dose that was recommended after having taken a half dose the night before just to make sure I was allergic or something. The night before all I got was a lil CEV and fell asleep so, nothing really to report on that one. I took a double because I was brave, I paid for my arrogance. :)\n\n1st, I had OEV and CEV, then I was shot into a state that felt like it was between being awake and sleep. Kind of like when you know you are dreaming but are still aware of what is going on on the other side of your closed eyes. During this time I was mostly in awe of what I was seeing, with my eyes open or closed, I saw the same thing. It was like I wasn't in my body, but somewhere else instead. At one point I ended up in a place that was similar to a massive library, while I was there I felt like I could get the answers to anything I wanted. I was in awe though and just soaked it all in, going from the library to some dark place and back several times. All while also seeing objects and shapes that I can't even explain. It was crazy and lasted probably 2 or 3 hours. \n\n2nd, I was guided, by something unexplainable, in a ghost of xmas past, present, future kind of way. I was shown everything I ever did wrong, I was shown the impact those events had on others. I would wake for a few seconds as this went on for about 2 hours, each time I awoke, I found myself to be crying like a baby, totally releasing everything I had inside me. Then the dreaded purge came but for me, it was anything but dreaded.. It was like I released everything, all things wrong not just in my own life, but also in the world. It was the most horrendous wrenching feeling but the most blissful at the same time. Once the purge passed, I found myself awake and fully aware, like it was over... I continued listening to some youtube Icaros and all of a sudden I was blasted back into purgatory... I remember coming to at one point and I was in the fetal position at the bottom of my bed, I started begging for \"them\" to just kill me or let me live, but to make up their minds. Then I came to again after who knows how long of that happening, I was back in the normal spot in my bed, again listening to the Icaros.. Then I thought it was over, I felt kind of done so, I closed my eyes for a second and bam, I was back in the shit. Instead of the same painful torture though, I hit the 3rd phase.\n\n3rd, I was in what I could only imagine, must have been heaven.. And I'm Atheist.. I felt the absolute most pure joy.. Complete euphoria.. If there is a God, the feeling I felt could only be compared to what it must feel like to be in his arms. While I had these euphoric feelings I also was shown what seemed like a glimpse of the future. I saw myself, my friends and family, I saw the world in general and all was great. This phase only lasted a short while, maybe 15-20 minutes for me at least it felt like it was that short. \n\n4th, this phase for me was just bliss mostly. I was awake and watching the TV screen while listening to Icaros, still had moderate OEV watching. I just laid there, listening and watching and thinking about what I had experienced. Probably an hour or two went by and I felt like it was time to go to bed, so I did. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I felt awesome, major afterglow that lasted most of the day. By far the most influential and most profound experience of my entire life. This was my first ever psychedelic experience and it kicked off my exploration into these other realms.\n\n\nI have since also done pure DMT by itself and in the form of Changa. With DMT pure, I wouldn't even say it compares to Ayahuasca, in small doses anyway. Low end DMT will put you in a short state of bliss with the world around you completely altered. For me anyway.. When I do smaller doses, it's like I'm in a cartoon world, everything is altered around me. My house looks different, all my pictures or changed, even the english letters on things is some other language, some alien looking stuff. I have looked at my wall of NFL hats and they were all changed, the team symbol was different and the words on them were different. I've even done it naked in bed and completely freaked out when I glanced at my junk.. lol I've probably said, out loud, thousands of times in 20 or so trips, \"this is so weird!\". I'm still trying to come to grips with what I see when I visit.\n\nNow, with Changa, that adds another dimension to DMT just as Ayahuasca does.. You can experiment with different plants infused with DMT to get different additions to the experience. Not all are good though, I've had some really scary changa, so start with small doses or you may find yourself waking in a shit storm. I've woke up outside in the freezing cold, naked and wondering WTF just happened with no memory of who I was, where I was, what I had done. Sometimes it takes a good couple of minutes for memories of this life to return. It's pretty freaky. I have stopped doing it solo for this reason. I've only ever freaked out on DMT when an MAOI was included in the mixture. It adds a LOT to the potency for me. \n\nNow the crazy part... I have also tried 4-ACO-DMT (it is NOT DMT)... Everything I have ever heard or read about it is that it should be like shrooms.. Well...... Not for me! I did very large dose of the stuff and I was shot off on an 8 hour trip that was exactly the same as my DMT trips. I was in the same crazy world where all of my stuff, myself, my dogs, everything was alien to me. It was insane and I freaked out a bit because I knew, I wouldn't be back in 15-20 minutes.. I knew I was in this one for the long haul.. Unfortunately I don't remember too much about it though.. I woke up about 8 hours after I started sitting on the toilet, with a massive knot on the back of my head so, at some point, I must have fallen and hit my head. \n\nA reliable trip sitter is highly recommended if you're going to explore these dimensions extensively. :) \n\nI have always heard that these substances will show you, what you need to see.. So, I'm sure your experiences will be a lot different than mine. I find that I am hyper sensitive to DMT now though and I can break through on the smallest of doses, especially when I make changa out of it. \n\nI hope my accounts help, best wishes for a safe and enlightening journey. Be safe and let go.","score":"15","subreddit":"DMT"}

Suddenly it becomes harder match-make, fights falling apart more often.  Nobody is going to make more out of this.","score":"14","subreddit":"MMA"}
{"body":"\u0026gt;\"Conor had a deal with the UFC. And Conor's now going back and trying to renegotiate and it just doesn't work that way. It can't. You can't write everything down, you can't get your contracts done all the time in this business. There's 500 guys under contract. There's not even that many employees in the UFC. I think there's like 340 employees with 500 fighters. There's 53 shows scheduled for a year that only has 52 weeks in the year. You have to be able to make a phone call, count on whatever the guy says, hang up the phone and that's the end of it. You have to be able to do that.\n\n\u0026gt;\"Conor has a contract, he made a deal, somewhere he didn't sign it. Let the promotion go out, let the money get spent and then realized ‘I've got the upper hand. Now I can come back and renegotiate. Who's going to tell me no when the advertising is already done?' That's what he did. Guaranteed. With no inside knowledge, guaranteed that's what happened.\"\n\n\nSo tell me if I am interpreting this correctly.....\n\nChael is saying that the UFC has a rather large roster and a rather large amount of shows, and fighters that could be located anywhere in the world. But actual contracts work, in a sense, in 2 separate parts.\n\n* Part 1. \"Hey Conor, You want the Nate Diaz rematch at UFC 200?\" \"You bet your sweet arse I do, make it at 170lb.\"\n\n* Part 2. UFC lawyers actually draw up a legal fight contract which Nate and Conor physically sign.\n\nChael is saying that in the case of UFC 200 Nate vs Conor, Part 1 was accomplished. Part 2 is a logistical nightmare though and takes time to accomplish. In this case, perhaps Part 2 wasn't yet accomplished. But the UFC begins Promoting the billing anyway. As a fight promotion, this is a necessary practice, It actually is not feasible to withhold Promoting a fight card until every single fighter physically signs their own contracts.\n\nSo we were left with a period where the UFC freely and openly began promoting UFC 200. Conor allows time to pass while UFC public obligation builds (due to promotion). The UFC begins exerting it's demands on Conor to show up to these press conferences. **Conor knows that the UFC is already publicly on the hook for UFC 200 even though he hasn't signed an actual contract, so Conor attempts to use that fact as leverage [for more money].** The UFC doesn't budge. Conor calls their bluff and announces retirement. UFC calls Conors bluff and doesn't budge on pay. \n\n\nBoom, UFC 200 main event ruined in a failed contractual leverage scheme fueled by Conor - but aided by shoddy (but necessary) contractual practice on the UFCs part.\n\nSorry Conor but once you lose once then your leverage starts to go down.","score":"46","subreddit":"MMA"}

Kimbo had a ridiculously huge online following starting back in 03 with his street fighting videos. Back at a time where MMA was still in its infancy, and people were still trying to answer the question *which style is better*. Kimbo coming in as an MMA fighter with some success in smaller shows, but highly successful street brawler, a lot of his fans expected to do very well. His subsequent loss to Big Country really made a lot of people realise the importance of appropriate training for martial arts. I have friends who have taken up Muay Thai and become fairly successful on the back of following Kimbo's career. He bought a lot of fans to the sport of MMA and martial arts in general.

{"body":"That's sort of understandable. Say you need a non critical bolt for your car (which you and you family I trust your safety in). The dealer will charge you $15, Autozone will charge you $5 for what may literally be the exact same bolt from the same forge, and Ace Hardware will charge you $2 for a bolt that fits the same ratings and specs. Provided that they are all the same grade bolt the only appreciable difference may be the anti corrosion coating and a slight bit of casting flash. In aviation those prices are exponentially higher as the dealer bolt has been certified by the FAA and the NAPA bolt has not. For non critical components (radio instal, exhaust hanger, screwing that sweet hula girl to the dash) I might happily use generic hardware. For critical components (lug nuts, tie rod ends, wheel bearings) I might happily use name brand OE fitment hardware which can often be better than OEM or also be the OEM supplier sold under its own packaging. For life saving and precision components (seat belt hardware, airbag sensors, engine head or main bearing bolts) I'm going OEM all day every day. Should something nasty happen and the highway patrol take a year to write a six hundred page report documenting and dissecting my ride, it might be a little embarrassing regardless of if any of those components were found to be at fault at all. Shocker; most vehicles are like this including the ones serviced entirely at the dealer (the dealerships I've worked at all had generic nut and bolt bins), you're far more likely to die in a car than a plane, and planes are far better maintained and inspected than cars.

I assure you, I get a *ton* of indigent clients who pick up 10+ Driving After Revo cases in the years following a DWI because they can't come anywhere close to paying that reinstatement fee off. They won't people pay it off in installments beyond two $340 payments, which I've always thought was a particularly lolworthy middle finger gesture to poor people. And if it's one of a number of aggravated types of DWI charges they have to use Interlock for a year, which is something like $10 or $20 a day (assuming 10/day, that's $3,650 for that year) another civil DL issue rather than criminal -- most of them don't even try because it's so far out of their reach.","score":"14","subreddit":"law"}

Their hours, position stability, and entire life is open to extreme fluctuation, and they often are unable to store any money to safeguard their existence if something goes wrong.\n\nIt would be one thing if people signed on for this but a lot of companies do not make it clear what the employee is getting into. I worked a similar job when I was way younger where I was told that I was going to be on call but \"Pretty much get full time\" and ended up getting about 7 hours a week. It's impossible to \"get anything in writing\" and your job is so unskilled and easily replaceable that if you asked for that they'd just pick one of the other 100 or so people trying to apply to it.\n\n\u0026gt;Following a similar effort last year, several companies, including Abercrombie \u0026amp; Fitch, Gap, J.Crew, Urban Outfitters, Pier 1 Imports and the parent company of Bath \u0026amp; Body Works and Victoria's Secret ended the use of on-call shifts.\n\nMy partner worked for Bath \u0026amp; Body Works back in 2011 and instead of being rewarded for busting her ass with some sort of commission structure or praise, she was rewarded with being able to fucking come to work and actually support herself and live.

{"body":"alright so i have like 2000 hours of soldier and nearly 12000 games of MGE played so I *really* love scout matchups v soldier. You need to keep a couple things in mind in a scout v soldier and you can usually at least force a draw\n\n1. it's your fight to lose. While in practice, a good scout vs a good soldier is usually tipped in the scouts favor, it has to do with the scout's ability to exploit weaknesses rather than his ability to create openings. Anytime you lose scout v soldier, you managed to fuck up either your positioning or your aim. If you feel a threat is in the area, move indoors, focus on baiting, and try to take the fight on your terms whenever possible. Doing so removes scout's main advantage of being able to pick what fights he wants to take. If you can manage to get a scout indoors or close to you without him noticing you, you will either force him to retreat or kill him as long as your aim isn't 100% terrible. \n2. You *always* do more damage. The only time he can out damage you is if you pull out your shotgun and he gets close enough to abuse the extra ramp up on his, and even then you have more health. With good movement and equal accuracy, you can literally pull out a shotgun and win every fight. \n3. Your overall goal is 1 good rocket and 1 shotgun, or 1 good rocket and 1 splash rocket. If you can open the fight with a 80+ damage rocket, 90% of the time the scout will just bail out and give up. If he presses you, you're now fighting on your terms, and you control the tempo of the fight. If he backs up and tries to spam you, you can whiff half your clip on your shotgun and still frag him. If he rushes, you can just shoot straight down and the 40 splash will kill him. Even worst case scenarios with the rockets are still actually pretty nice: 3 garbage splash rockets will still kill him 90% of the time. \n4. Never ever ever ever ever ever rocket jump towards him or anywhere he can get to. Rocket jumping soldiers are insanely easy to hit, and the odds are you'll take a 80 dmg 8) and your jump will be stalled and he'll follow up with another good shot to frag you. Once you're in the fight, stay on the ground and avoid blast jumping if possible.\n5. Never be afraid of a nuclear option. If the other dude is good enough to be a threat that you need a reddit post for, trading with him is probably a good move. I can't give specifics for every scenario, but if you think you can't win a fair fight, try to bait him really close and shoot yr feet until you both die.\n\nOther than that, its mostly going to come down to practice and DM skill.","score":"25","subreddit":"tf2"}

{"body":"While I'm fine with them changing it in the movie, it's not true that it doesn't really change anything. First of all, he and Durotan being friends is no longer anything special if they're from the same clan, so we no longer have an example of how desperate the orcs would have to be to unite as a people. Secondly, Orgrim is no longer going to be constantly forced to question his personal beliefs as the chieftain he is sworn to constantly does things Orgrim disagrees with. Most importantly, Orgrim challenging Blackhand's leadership no longer has the significance it once did. When Orgrim was a Blackrock orc, second in command to Blackhand's, his turning against Blackhand was more of a personal sacrifice than anything. He had sworn his loyalty to Blackhand, and to go against him was dishonorable. But Orgrim sacrifices his personal honor and challenges Blackhand, all so that he can end Gul'dan's control over the Horde and make the orcs as a whole honorable once again. Yes, Durotan's death pushes Orgrim over the edge, but he's ultimately doing it for his people. If Orgrim's part of the Frostwolves, then he hasn't really been forced to make the choice between personal honor and loyalty, and doing what is best for his people. Not to mention the fact that he's just going to be challenging Blackhand out of revenge for Durotan's death (not that Blackhand kills Durotan, I think it's far more likely that Gul'dan wins the duel with Durotan dishonorably and Blackhand stands by and does nothing) and not for the greater good of his people. Orgrim just isn't the same character if he doesn't have to make the same hard choices between his own honor and his people's.","score":"21","subreddit":"wow"}

You sound like someone who read a few comments disagreeing with you and decided to make a post in response. I won't share my opinion on legacy servers, but many people are sick and tired of hearing about it because the discussion has been had multiple times throughout WoWs history, and every point has already been discussed in the past month or so. \n\nYou're applying a viewpoint to people without providing any examples. It isn't wrong, they don't hate people enjoying WoW. They're just tired of seeing the same thing posted over, and over, and over, and over. I see threads asking the same exact questions here every day. Honestly, the opposite is true depending on when you come visit the subreddit. I provided an opposing view, trying to give measured and detailed reasons as to why legacy servers may not be a good idea, and I got downvoted and thrashed by most people. So it goes both ways.

{"body":"I have nothing against Legacy servers, but my God, some of you guys try and make it seem way more simple then it really is to fit your narrative. \n\nIn reality Vanilla WoW wouldn't really be getting new subs (just old nostalgic veterans)because WoD WoW is the better game right now. Believe it or not, Vanilla has some awful mechanics that todays gamers don't enjoy.\n\nThat isn't even to mention the cost (Nostalrius was FREE), the slippery slope of \"now we want BC/WotLK/Cata/MoP/WoD etc. legacy servers!\", and the harsh inevitable reality that people will try it out for fun for a while then quit after a few months.\n\nI really have no horse in this race, but it seems like Legacy server players would be a costly, temporary, and niche set of people.","score":"-4","subreddit":"wow"}
{"body":"This is what I am always saying. Everybody talks about how WoW is becoming more casual and accessible with Cataclysm and beyond. Yet, really, based on Subscriptions, WoW was most accessible during TBC and WotLK. You don't need to be able to get fully epic geared in a weekend in order to enjoy this game. You just need to have things to do, no matter how small.\n\nAdversity is the only thing that adds value to an achievement, and Blizzard has spent the last 6+ years removing adversity from the game. Well, now there's no adversity, but nothing matters. \n\nI went to do Deadmines yesterday on my level 16 rogue. I simply stealthed to the end of each boss, soloed it, and won the match. I remember when Deadmines was a big ordeal. You had to spend ~15 minutes in Westfall talking in chat trying to put a group together. You had to go through the Moonbrook area with lots of high-damage level 18 mage mobs that would kill you. You had to run through the mines full of enemies to get to the dungeon entrance. Maybe one of your allies couldn't make the run, so you all go back for him.\n\nThen, you spend the next hour or two slowly working your way through a semi-challenging dungeon. Your party chats, you work together, you fight a bit over loot, and you get the dungeon done. When you walk out of that cave on the end of the dungeon, you *FEEL GOOD*. You feel like you just did something. Maybe you're ready to log off now. Maybe you made friends with the guys you just ran with because they happened to be pretty good at the game.\n\nThe point is, people might complain that it took 2-3 hours to run a  simple Deadmines. But I'd rather spend 3 hours doing something that makes me feel *something* then spending 15 minutes going through the motions so I can get my exp prize at the end.","score":"252","subreddit":"wow"}

{"body":"It's not ridiculous because you are not forced to use buffs or heirlooms or RaF. If you want a more in depth leveling experience, by spending 3 months getting to max level  YOU CAN. Heirlooms and XP pots give players options, I have already seen all this content 7 times, seeing it again won't change my opinion of the game it just a pointless tedious task at this point. It's not challenging, it's not engaging and it never was except for 2 months back in vanilla and in cata that I spent leveling through the content.\n\nIn fact I just had a friend who got the game for Christmas and she's just turned lvl 63 in Zangarmarsh with 6 days /played. If a player is new to the game there is so much content they need to go through while leveling they wont get bored. The problem is the game is 11 years old and 90% of the players have seen it all countless times.

{"body":"Here's what I just posted on another reply:\nI am SO EXCITED about the deportation story, actually, because I just received an email from the woman that she was finally able to leave the country yesterday!!!! Here's a quote: \"We are finally home! Thank you so much for everything that you have done for me and my son. My family is so grateful. We are all grateful.\"\nThe woman was arrested after she delivered her first baby at the main private hospital in Qatar. She was taken from the hospital to jail because she could not provide a marriage certificate. The standard penalty for a baby out of wedlock is one year. She spent one year in prison with her baby boy. While there, due to the imprisonment, she defaulted on some loans she had taken out. That resulted in two years more imprisonment for writing \"bad checks\" (pre-dated checks are required in Qatar for most loans, so if you don't make a payment, the lender tries to cash the check, and writing a bad check is illegal, hence the jail time). Once she was released from jail, she no longer had a job or a valid visa to be in the country. Her son was also illegal. However, she could not leave the country because Qatar had imposed a travel ban due to the outstanding civil cases that had been filed against her in the interim. So when she was released from jail, she had several civil suits pending that amounted to many times the original loan amount due to interest and penalties, and despite having served a criminal sentence, she now had to face the civil suits and could not leave. Her son was stuck there too, illegitimate and unable to go to school. She was living with her cousin and being fed out of the kindness of peoples' hearts. I found out about the case through an anonymous news report on Doha News and contacted the reporter. Although I do not deal with Qatari administrative law, I had done a lot of pro bono work in immigration and administrative legal issues both in the States and in Qatar, and I knew someone who I thought could help her. My firm agreed to take on the case pro bono, and after a few months of meetings with ministry officials and the deportation department, they finally let her leave yesterday!\nUnfortunately, her case is extremely common, and I have heard many, many similar stories.\n\nI can't say my life was horrible.  That's the thing that is making me feel a little crazy.  Maybe I did too much at once.  Maybe I have no idea what I want to do.  Or maybe I just have a really good idea, an awesome family, and want to spend time doing it.\n\nGreat idea on the boy dolls.

{"body":"Okay, I don't work for Goldman Sachs, but I see these types of talks all the time. Here's my response to something a while back in the Seattle subreddit:\n\nProperly formatted permalink: [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/4bfeys/hillary_event_tomorrow_at_rainier_beach_high/d192yuy)\n\nNote: this is not a pro-Hillary comment, this is a comment to clear the air about these talks from someone who works in corporate events.  \n\n\nSo, regarding these kinds of speeches: I work in live corporate events. I've been doing in for 13 years. I travel all over the country doing it, do it at very high level, and have seen many very well known celebrities and politicians (as well as lesser known celebrities and politicians) speak. I've seen Hillary speak before.  \n\n\nWhen it's a mid level celebrity, they're typically soliciting the conference to talk, charging in the $10-50k range, and tailor their talks to the company they're presenting to so that it provides some value.  \n\n\nWhen you have a very high level presenter, like a former president or a major CEO, they're actively courted by the company holding the conference, they charge insane amounts of money (or do it for free for an organization they believe in or for publicity.) But what's more, they talk about whatever the hell they feel like. For example, Neil DeGrass Tyson has spoken at the Tableau conference two years in a row, and he just talks about cool science shit for a while. I saw George W Bush speak at a meeting for a prominent financial company once, and the only thing he said about money was \"I don't think you want my financial advice.\"  \n\n\nWhen I saw Hillary speak, she just talked about her time in the Senate, various issues in the world, and what she thought was happening in the U.S. She did not say anything tailored to the company that paid her to be there.  \n\n\nShe was not yet running for president officially (pre-Obama), and he was not on teleprompter. To get the transcripts from those events, people from her campaign would have to contact the company, have them pull up the archival footage (if they kept it, a lot of times they'll only store it for a year or two,) and then get it transcribed. That can take a long time, or the company might not be willing to release the transcripts themselves because they don't want to be associated with the political fallout.  \n\n\nI can guarantee that she has said something in years of giving talks that would be able to be used against her, because if anyone gives enough talks over a number of years you can misrepresent them--that's what happens to every political candidate ever. So if it's even possible to get the transcripts, I can understand why she wouldn't want to release them.\nAnyway, bottom line is this: Goldman Sachs only pays Hillary $250,000 per speech because she wouldn't be willing to take the gig otherwise (and it's pocket change to them,) and they just want a big name speaker for their event. They'll pay $250,000 to anyone who makes their boring financial conference interesting, and I hope companies keep doing it because otherwise my job is going to suck.  \n\n\nThe reason that Bernie Sanders hasn't done these kind of paid speaking gigs is because until he ran for president, he wasn't a big enough name to draw that kind of money. If he doesn't win the election, you better believe he'll be getting phone calls to do talks for big money. Maybe he'll take it, maybe he won't. But he'll be invited.","score":"94","subreddit":"IAmA"}

Cats bites get infected very easily, and our cat got me (I was about 45 at the time).  He got both my legs, my right one more severely than the left. I washed them, put hydrogen peroxide on them, then neosporin on them. I guess I wasn't as careful with my left leg. It got infected and went into sepsis and I'm very fortunate to have not lost my leg. They really should give up this cat to someone who can tame him and is equipped to handle this aggression. Your parents had good intentions, and your mom shouldn't feel guilty. If they still want a cat, they can go to a no kill shelter and adopt a pet that has been acclimated to humans and now needs a forever home. After our old cat died (he lived to be 16; the only reason I didn't give him up was because my husband died and I didn't want my son to lose his pet, too) I went and got a great little girl.

Great car.  Cool tech.  Great things they're doing, but it's just not enough for me to jump ship.  \n\nEdit: everyone claims that incentives and tax breaks will be the selling point.  You do realize those are gifts from the Federal government and States to get more people into electric / green cars.  Those could very well go away in 3 years.  Once these things become main-stream - say goodbye to any tax breaks.  It'll be 35k with tax just like every other car on the road -- just with no need for gas.  \n","score":"-7","subreddit":"cars"}

{"body":"Here is my recipe, it's based off the NYT link below, but I used an additional egg and flour measurements. \n\nIngredients:\n\n* 3.5 cups of strong bread flour. \n* 1/4 - 1/2 cup plain flour. \n* 1 1/2 tsp salt \n* 50g unsalted butter. \n\n* 3 eggs\n* 2 tsp dried active yeast\n* 2 tbs caster sugar\n* 3 tbs warm milk  \n\nMethod:\n\n* Combine bread flour, salt and butter in a food processor. Blitz until combined. If you don't have a food processor, combine with your fingers as you would making pastry. \n* Combine 1 cup of warm water, the warm milk, yeast and sugar in a bowl. Leave in a warm place for 5 minutes, until foamy, or ten if you get distracted by something else like I did. \n* Combine the flour mixture with the yeast, and add two beaten eggs. Mix to combine until you have a sticky dough. \n* Add 1/4 cup of plain flour to reach a manageable dough, more so if required. Knead for 8-10 minutes. \n* Place into a greased bowl, and allow to double in size. I left mine for 2 hours. \n* Separate the dough into equal balls (mine made 6 X 130g balls). Place onto a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Cover with a clean tea towel and allow to rise again, I left mine for 1.5 hours. \n* Pre-heat oven to 200C. \n* Brush the risen buns with the remaining beaten egg. \n* Place a shallow tray filled with water in the base of oven. Place buns into the oven and bake until golden, approximately 15 minutes. Mine were in for just over!\n\nI apologise for any formatting issues!\n\nOriginal recipe idea: http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012612-light-brioche-buns\n\nEdit to add: Important words I forgot.","score":"74","subreddit":"food"}

You'll notice when some birds move their heads, that's when their nictitating membranes also close.\n\nIf you were to perceive every motion in your visual field...you would get dizzy.  That's what happens when you spin around really fast and keep your head facing in one direction, or when you place your forehead on a bat and spin around.  You're overloading your vestibular system.

Why? Who knows? The school decided to investigate her as an honor code violator.\n\nTo me, it is clear the police officer shouldn't be doing this shit.  I don't know if what he did was actually illegal, but it certainly was pretty bullshit, IMO.\n\nWith that said, if there was a legit honor code violation, and they have evidence it occurred, I'm not sure why they shouldn't investigate it.  \n\n\u0026gt;The school is saying \"We can't withdraw you until the Honor Code violation investigation is completed.\" In the meantime, she cannot attend school while the Honor Code violation is investigated, which is giving her a failing grade instead of an incomplete grade.\n\nI didn't get that from the article.  Can you quote where you saw it?  The only reason that I saw given for why they wouldn't let her withdraw was the unsubstantiated claim by her that the:\n\n\u0026gt;request was denied because, according to her account, administrators said they “can’t prove the rape occurred”\n\nAgain, not seeing that the honor code investigation is what is holding it up.\n\n\u0026gt;She can't (or won't on the advice of her lawyer) take part in the Honor Code investigation because the trial of the man charged with rape is pending and discussing the case is not advised. (I would proceed with caution here too, given the action of the police officer/coach).\n\nAgain, not seeing that the lack of retro-withdraw it is because of the honor code investigation.\n\nAdditionally, I'm not sure how different this would be at other schools.\n\nRetroactive withdrawls, which is what she requested, almost always place teh burden of proof on the student to prove that it is deserved.  \n\nI don't know any school in the country where you can say \"Give me a retro-w, but I won't answer your questions about why I need it because my lawyer told me not to\" and you will actually get it.\n\n\u0026gt;In the past, BYU has held up transcripts of attendees who were honor-coded out. These students then also lose any credits they have earned at BYU and have to retake any classes they have already passed at BYU, potentially costing the students thousands of wasted dollars and a lot of time.\n\nSounds like a good reason not to attend BYU.\n\nHowever, if you attend BYU and you break the honor code, the fact that you may have been raped some time *after* your violation occurred doesn't seem like a good reason to get a free pass...","score":"-4","subreddit":"news"}

They complained about corruption in the crown and taxes, but now the US is far more corrupt than even the UK, apart from the right to bear arms, you have essentially quite a few less freedoms than us? which is absurd. You guys need to fight to take your country back. You are run by corrupt arseholes. FORCE them to change by voting these corrupt bastards out of power.

They believed in everyone protecting everyone else, and freedom from control by large powers (corporate OR governmental. UK business tycoons were kicked out en masse)  and the right to control your own finance without any government interference. So it is incredibly absurd that you get Americans going fuck yeah USA USA to capitalism and sometimes even having a severely hard-line approach to immigration even though the US was founded on completely different values.

{"body":"\u0026gt; Trans people have been using their preferred bathrooms for decades, yet all of the sudden its a problem?\n\nI'll tell you why it's a problem. Trans people used to be very quiet about their desire to use a different restroom, and generally sought to fit in, or \"pass\" for their chosen gender.\n\nNow, many trans people are making this into a political issue, where there ought not be an issue. Most people, myself included, give absolutely 0 fucks about whether someone wants to dress or act in a certain way that does not interfere with anyone else. Seriously, almost no one gives a flying fuck.\n\nMany trans people are now fighting things like gender neutral bathrooms (a fantastic, incredibly generous compromise for a TINY fraction of the population), and demanding to go into a bathroom where other people don't feel safe.\n\n\u0026gt;The big problem with this is now a true predator can enter the bathroom, if someone asks they can say they're trans and hide and wait in a stall for a victim without any further suspicion.\n\nLet's be honest, almost all of the sexual predators are men (people born with penises). There is not a widespread problem of people with vaginas dressed as men assaulting people with penises. There is a problem of people with penises assaulting other people.\n\nThat's what this is about. Many people with vaginas don't feel comfortable disrobing and using the restroom around those people born with penises. And their rights are equal to those of trans people, one party does not trump another.\n\nFinally, there is widespread evidence of tendentious \"science\" in this whole area of trans research. \"Treatment\" like gender reassignment correlates with worse outcomes, such as higher suicide rates. Most trans people also have serious comorbid mental disorders, and are often extremely disturbed. Unlike homosexuality (where the evidence of things like heritability and plasticity is mixed) there is no evidence that some people have a different gender than their biological one.","score":"-8","subreddit":"news"}

{"body":"The ballet world is super fucked up.  There's all sorts of problems surrounding professional dance companies including terrible wages, injuries, and eating disorders/body image issues.  Not to mention the grueling amount of training all through childhood that it takes to even come close to being a professional. \n\nProfessional dancers (or those training to be professional) are certainly aware of the \"preferences\" for certain types of bodies.  Basically, if you don't have the right body, you don't get to dance, hence the eating disorders and dancers pushing themselves so hard they have career ending injuries at 21.  Random, semi-related example: one of my friends has shoulders that don't slope down, they're level across (mine are too, it's just natural human variation).  Around age 12, her ballet teacher used to pull down on her arms during class until her shoulders were sloped downward (lower at the shoulder than the neck), and she would essentially just strain through class and all of the exercises while trying to hold this completely unnatural position, because that's what's considered \"right\" in ballet.  For reference, it literally changed nothing about her ability to do the steps, it was just because it was classical ballet training, and that's the \"right\" way for your shoulders to be.  \n\nSorry for the tirade, this is just one of the subjects that really gets to me.  There are some interesting interviews and articles you can find online, especially from retired ballerinas, that talk about their experiences within the professional ballet world.  It really opens your eyes to what goes on behind the scenes.","score":"97","subreddit":"pics"}

{"body":"As someone who deals with taxes, people with more income that you do in fact pay taxes- an insane amount of taxes; more taxes than you or anyone else; some are paying more in taxes than some households take in at the end of the year. Wrap your tinny head around that fact for a second. When they say rich people pay more taxes- they physically pay more taxes than anyone else. When you make a large sum of money per year and MOST of it goes away to taxes, you can see why finding loop holes becomes so attractive. And it's never ending- the government like some parasite wants more and more and more until there is nothing left of you or your children. Everything gets taxed. Your inheritance or whatever money you come across is going to get taxed away (depending on how your tax laws work). Not all financially well off people are crooks. Most of these financially well off human beings are extremely hard workers who deserve to make $x/year and I respect that. I don't go around bitching about it demanding that they pay even more of their income away to the government so that they can sit level with the rest of society. \n\nThe MORE you tax these guys, the more likely they are to start finding loop holes in the system and abuse it- which again, no one seems to wrap their heads around because \"fuk rich people bruh\". You have to tax fair, not disproportionately. Lower incomes get taxed at a MUCH lower rate than higher income gets taxed. Increasing the tax rate to 90% for the top 1% and lowering it to 1% for the bottom 99% of society is going to backfire quite badly. ","score":"-5","subreddit":"pics"}

{"body":"Some bald eagle fun facts\n\n* Bald eagles have a massive wingspread of about 7 feet (2.13 meters)\n\n* Normally, bald eagles weigh 6.5 to 14 pounds (3 to 6.5 kilograms)\n\n* The bald eagle is found only in North America. \n\n* Bald eagles are typically solitary creatures. When there is abundant food, though, they may gather with others in groups of up to 400, according to the  University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. \n\n* Bald eagles are \"fish eagles.\" They are in this classification because their main food source is fish. They will also eat smaller birds, other bird's eggs and small animals like rabbits, reptiles, amphibians and crabs.\n\n* Bald eagles are thought to be monogamous. This means that once the birds find a mate, they will continue to only mate with each other for the rest of their lives. A bald eagle will find another mate only if it is widowed.\n\n* Bald eagles make large nests from sticks, grass, feathers, moss and cornstalks to accommodate their eggs. The largest bald eagle nest on record was found in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was 9.5 feet (2.9 meters) in diameter and 20 feet (6.1 m) deep, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. **It was estimated to weigh 2 metric tons (4,409 lbs.)**.\n\n* Though bald eagles can't swim, they can cross water without flying over it. They will sit in the water and row themselves across with their wings, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. [Bald eagle (not) swimming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oznph6m9lOs) Thanks to /u/therealxris\n\n\n* Bald eagles have no sense of smell, but they can taste. For example, if a bald eagle thinks that its food tastes spoiled, it won't eat it.\n\nhttp://www.livescience.com/27317-bald-eagles.html\n\n**edit:** fixed UofM for the Wolverines and added the eagle [not] swimmng","score":"1468","subreddit":"pics"}

I for one know most of us will spend the next days hearing the nonstop chatter of Madridistas spouting praise for Zidane and Ronaldo and Benzema, etc. They wrecked our winning streak, at home, on Johan's memorial day. Whatever.\nLet's look at everything in the grander scheme of things. Barca, for a long time, has been dominating, save a few ties, in Spain and La Liga. We beat Madrid at the Bernabeu 4-0. We pulled off some other good victories. Nothing could stop us. Until we got a cold hard slap in the face by Zidane and the gang. This, I argue, is actually a blessing in disguise. Tell me about a player that loses a very iconic match and does't automatically become hungry. Enrique realizes, as much as the players, that some of the members of the team are key and others are not. As an instinct, all the players will become more hungry. They won't want to risk an upset against Atletico, and they realize that some spots may be up for grabs, or that their spot may be challenged. Intensity will increase as players all look to make their mark.  \n    \n  If Enrique plays his cards well, we could potentially see a better and more killer team in the coming matches, in a time during tournaments and leagues where complacency ends all. At a crucial time in the year, Barcelona get a kick to the rear and their engine, which was now on cruise control, at once gets explicitly used by the drive (i'm bad at car metaphors). What I mean to say is that at this point in the year, keeping the winning streak and the false sense of security that it may have given us is dangerous, especially in a time where our matches become more and more unforgiving. The loss today woke up our players, and I guarantee you that Messi, Suarez, Neymar, Rakitic, Busi, Iniesta, Mascherano, Pique, Dani, Alba, and Bravo will all be chomping at the bit to regain confidence and blow the competition out of the water.   \n  \nThe players know what is at stake here, and I doubt there was ever a better time to be alerted about it. We are still 6 points clear off the top, and with the extra motivation that the loss has given the players, I am sure that we will pick up the win the next la liga and CL games.  \n  \nVisca Barca.

This game literally forced you to have 2 dedicated engineers repairing everything otherwise the ship attacking you would have the upper hand. \n\nHonestly thinking about this its not surprising the game lost popularity... this has to be a big factor when half of your users are bored to death numbers are going to drop leaving less people to fill those spots, which in turn causes them to leave. \n\nEdit: People saying \"I played engineer and I liked it, I don't know why people are saying its boring\"... Opinion is opinion, everyone's got one, it just so happens that the majority of this particular fanbase found it boring. I almost always played engineer too, mostly because I played the game solo and it would be the open spot with random groups.

{"body":"\u0026gt; Look, I'm not arguing that this moment in Portal was particularly groundbreaking for me, or even in general, but I cannot deny its impact and meme-ability in the gaming community, and I cannot ignore the effect it had on some people's personal perceptions of what is capable of being expressed in a video game as opposed to other mediums, which is also what this video was talking about.\n\nA meme doesn't legitimize anything.  It's a following, a symbol that people are attracted towards and gravitate towards.  It just means that people played something and LIKED it, and oftentimes it clouds the \"depth\" of things.\n\nThe nature of the effect is the question I'm raising.\n\nIs it really that the interactivity is the big deal?  Or is it really the nature of the medium and the audiences constant attempts to legitimize that medium, then over-emphasizing and over-exaggerating a desired effect to make that come \"true\"?\n\nThe emphasis on \"feelings\" seems to be a crutch on legitimizing some arts, when it merely brings it to a designation of \"art\" which is inhabited with everything ranging from a macaroni imitation on paper by a 3 year old to something by Van Gogh.\n\n\u0026gt;I agree with you, the point here isn't that \"Games make you feel\". We know this. The point is very specifically that \"Games make you feel from the perspective of the star, or the actor, the main character, rather than from the point of view of someone listening to a story.\" There is a big difference between hearing a story and living that story, and games bring people closer than books or movies to actually experiencing events rather than just seeing them happen to someone else.\n\nThat's a huge amount of unsubstantiated conjecture that, again, is difficult to divorce from how seriously we take a medium.\n\nHeck, if you want to talk about first-person feelings towards inanimate objects and the arts, we can say the same for something like Flatlands.  There's nothing about this that actually accentuates the interactivity of games to make that art stand out and be special that other mediums haven't done or tried or explored.  \n\nYou go so far as to make a completely hypothetical situation between Portal and Cast Away that, honestly, you can't effectively say that the interactivity aspect of it is the reason why you're feeling that way.\n\nHeck, what's to say that you don't feel the same way by *watching* someone play Portal and controlling that player without commentary?","score":"-5","subreddit":"Games"}

The idea behind this model is that if someone has 20$ to spend and he's playing your game, he might spend it to get that really nice gun/car skin or outfit or whatever. The difficulty here is that your game actually has to be good so that it retains people long enough that they spend money in it.\n\nThen you have the \"power buyer\" audience, which is what GTAO aimed at. Basically, you put out a version of the game that requires you to literally \"work\", which provides no fun, and people quickly quit, or purchase items for an influx of fun. Some people will stick around, the majority of players will rotate in and out, and a very small fraction will dump large sums of money into the game.\n\nI am trying to find the interview with the South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt stone about them being approached for a south park cellphone game, and the entire time the person pitching the idea was avoiding the question \"But who is the targeted customer demographics?\" and then in the end they were told that it was like 0.1% of players that will pay stupid amount of money on their game, which turned them off completely from making games with MTX.","score":"16","subreddit":"Games"}

Lastly, the gag about saluting is great, to this day my sister and I still do that. \n\n**Season 4:** \"Three Days of Snow\" Why is it called \"Puzzles?\" That's the puzzle! Also, Marshall shows for the umpteenth million time why he's the man. \n\n**Season 5:** \"The Playbook\" This is when Barney's ability to mastermind maniacal plots becomes permanently cemented into the show's structure. The Scuba Diver is great. \n\n**Season 6:** \"Bad News\" The reaction that Jason Segel gives to the news at the end is so visceral and real. Also, \"Last Words\" is a VERY close second, it equally gets you with the feels. So much feels in this show from now on. \n\n**Season 7:** \"Tick Tick Tick\" Ted and Marshal's adventure at the palooza is hysterical, especially the replay at the end. However, the winning moment in this episode/season is Barney's reaction, as time \"freezes\" and he looks back longingly at Robin. \n\n**Season 8:** \"Farhampton\" Klaus' speech at the end, themed by The Funeral, is in my opinion, the most *hauntingly beautiful* moment on this show.\n\n**Season 9:** \"How Your Mother Met Me\"  La Vie en Rose = FEELS. Cristin Milioti was amazing and criminally killed from the show at the end. \"Last Forever\" with the alternate ending is also very close. ","score":"15","subreddit":"HIMYM"}

You'll see a significant change in the amount of aroma after the first couple of small water adds.\n\nAlso, don't add ice to a nice spirit.

Also after looking at Musashi’s number 118 I noticed that the IJN didn’t have 18 battleships during WW2 but 12 total. However, this could possibly mean that this world didn’t have the need for aircraft carriers and also all planned battleships were made. This means that all of the Tosa class (Kaga) and Amagi class (Akagi) were made which will add up all battleships like this: Starting with the oldest IJN WW2 battleship Kongou as 101, Kongou class (4 ships), Fusou class(2 ships), Ise class (2 ships), Nagato class (2 ships), Tosa class (2 ships), Amagi class (4 ships) and Yamato class (3 ships). This will add up to 19 total and since Musashi is the second ship of the Yamato class (with possibly Yamato  appearing in the beginning as K117) it could make this theory plausible.\n\u0026gt; \n\nActually there was something very interesting I noticed during the show. \n\nAt one point, one of the girls noted the birds flying outside the window, and wondered if 'You could fly without helium or hydrogen'. \n\nTo which Munetani replies, 'Don't be ridiculous.'\n\nThat seems to me like the show is strongly implying that flight (or at least, flight accomplished by aerodynamic lift) was NOT discovered in this timeline, hence the absence of aircraft carriers.","score":"79","subreddit":"anime"}

{"body":"Welcome to the (technically) first episode of S\u0026amp;W season 2, guys. I checked and saw that this was an OVA so I’m not looking forward to any major plot developments.\n\n---\n\n**Spice and Wolf Episode 0 - Wolf and Amber Melancholy**\n\nThe camera seems to be panning over an ... inn? And zooming into a door.\n\nOh, Norah’s here! Yesterday’s episode seemed so final with them waving goodbye to her so this is surprising.\n\nEver the gentlemen, Lawrence, seating the two before sitting down himself.\n\nHolo’s silent for more than a minute … something’s wrong.\n\nThis food’s making me hungry. What’s up with Holo?\n\nAhahaha, omg, Lawrence’s blush at Norah what the hell\n\nI think this is the first time we’ve seen Lawrence well and truly drunk, he seems to be like a different person.\n\nHolo still glaring heatedly at Ennick, nothing’s changed.\n\nAnnnnnd she fell over.\n\nI wonder if Holo is truly immortal. It’s pretty obvious that she lived several decades when she was hiding amongst the wheat in the town but what about her current form? It’s kind of depressing to think about, because Holo reminiscing of her experiences with Lawrence *will* end some day, even if he *doesn’t* leave her after they reach the North, he’s eventually going to die anyways. He’s just a mortal.\n\nHolo regretting everything after a night of drinking, seems even the wise wolf is susceptible to that.\n\nIs it just me or is Holo getting really attached to Lawrence and his perception of her? It’s cute.\n\nAnd Lawrence is also getting really protective.\n\nThis is [so](http://imgur.com/xze2GOZ) damn [cute](http://imgur.com/rLUonWS).\n\nMy heart can’t take this.\n\nHolo’s dreaming about Lawrence holding her, ahaha.\n\nThat was actually a great point, even if it is *was* in jest. She’s wise because she acknowledges there are things she doesn’t know.\n\nLawrence’s offer on the food sounds positively delicious.\n\nOhhhh shit, that was some pretty blatant symbolism but that doesn’t stop it from being as impactful as it was. So Holo will have to choose between Lawrence and her own people, we all know who she’s probably going to choose. But that coincides with the point I made earlier, Lawrence is only a human, he’s going to die in what--50 years? It’s really sad but she’ll need to face it.\n\nHA, the *look* on Holo’s face as soon as he mentions Norah.\n\nLawrence is really dense when it comes to this, he seriously can’t figure out why Holo’s so hostile towards Norah?\n\nOmg this is perfect. That out-of-tune music just fading out as soon as Holo sees Norah.\n\nUhhhh, I didn’t quite understand the secret Norah and Holo were sharing. What’s the significance of asking about the secret to leading sheep is. Is it related to Lawrence somehow? I'm thinking she meant that Lawrence was her sheep and she had to have a big heart to lead Lawrence? Idk.\n\nIs this the new ED? Already like it better than the last one.\n\n---\n\nWe got banter and cute Holo this episode, which I’ll never be disappointed with. I think I’m going to like this season even better than the last one if this cheery atmosphere continues. \n\nAnd I’ve noticed Holo and Lawrence are really developing in their feelings for each other so that’s always great!\n\nJust one question I have: What did Holo mean when she said that Lawrence wouldn't notice if she was on her death bed and suffering a sickness? \n\nThat didn't make sense to me.","score":"14","subreddit":"anime"}

That's something this series does quite often, and better than anything else I've seen.\n\n* [\"Springtime, it's right around the corner.\"](http://i.imgur.com/rIOa0wx.png) All that ice Kousei has been frozen in for the last 2 years is finally starting to thaw.

The song is *in you.*\"](http://i.imgur.com/xVL6CTN.png) There's a fairly obvious double-meaning in what Kaori says to Kousei here. Not only does she mean that Kousei has memorized the sheet music after it 'plastered his world' for the last week, but that the music itself is inside him and where he should draw from, not from the notes on the page. Like her, he should play the way *he* wants to and express himself through the music. This is obviously in stark contrast to the way his mother taught him.\n\n* [\"She *is* the journey, with no clear destination in sight.

It's just beautifully put together, from the lighting to the animation to the music to the dialog. This was the moment during my first viewing that I knew the series was a step above and, like Kousei, I was completely in awe of Kaori.\n\n* [\"We don't want to keep Saint Saens waiting.\"](http://i.imgur.com/VFKtCvT.png) That slight pause before Kaori takes the first step out on stage.

{"body":"There's a massive massive gaping hole in your argument that I struggle to look past. And part of it is that the flarrowverse is in fact, not canon / retconned. WIth that in mind, lets explore the other reasons why your point is invalid. \n\n(1) The multiverse - there exists at least one universe where Jay Garrick is the original flash and Barry Allen is married to Iris West. This suggests that there is definitely a universe where Laurel and Oliver ended up married, Sara never became the Black Canary, and all three got training through other means. \n\n(2) The Arrow was already with the Black Canary in season 1 and 2. If you want to cry foul and say the Arrow writers fucked up by being unfaithful to the Green Arrow character, you'd still be wrong considering how much time they spent exploring that relationship and testing its limits to the point where Oliver will probably never be with either Sara or Laurel again. That's really the purpose of their father's character - He did everything in his power to split them and now that that arc is closed, we can rest assured that it'll stay closed as long as Det. Lance lives.\n\n(3) The first 3 seasons were all about Black Canary. People like to say that neither Sara nor Laurel had enough screen time an that Felicity took up all the spotlight, but those same people forget how Laurel used to go through the same shit when it was her story arc we were exploring for the first three seasons. The writers didn't explore the Black Canary character enough? You're mad. \n\n(4) About Carter and Kendra ... \n\n(5) A big part of Green Arrow's origin / love-life is Shado. Evidently, that whole love arc was explored to death  too (quite literally), so its not like the arrows didn't try to keep that whole relationship dynamic going. \n\n(6) The Green Arrow has always been portrayed as a bit of a lone wolf. Rest assured, there are hundreds of comics where Green Arrow teams up with Black Canary, Green Lantern, or the Flash to do whatever the hell it is superheros do, but most modern depictions of the Green Arrow that came up since the 80s/90s has portrayed him as a bit of a loose cannon who approaches every situation as a cynical and considerably negative yet humorous character who usually needs a lot of convincing to team up with anyone. While he may love the Black Canary in a lot of these series, the underlying message is always that he's always left going through life alone. \n\n(7) ARGUS was disbanded, the Suicide Squad was killed off, and Amanda Waller went down with them. So there's no longer a purpose to Batman's story, which suggests that Batman isn't a thing in the Flarrowverse, which suggests that the Arrow writers have full and total freedom to explore the Arrow character without even trying to thread on the Black Canary topic any longer. \n\n(8) With the love story between Speedy and Red Arrow, the whole aspect of Green Arrow having a loving companion would be excessive. And if you're so desperate for him to have one, Sara Lance is still very much in the picture. \n\nMy point is. You can still have a Green Arrow series without Black Canary. There are many Arrow origin stories without Black Canary. And any suggestion that this series is heading to the point where its an Arrow origin story without the Black Canary, shows a complete disregard to the fact that we already had the whole Black Canary x Green Arrow shtick in the first three seasons and that we've moved way past the origin story. \n\ntl;dr: get over it, Green Arrow can live without Black Canary","score":"-8","subreddit":"arrow"}

We’d run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-tow minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a-half minutes per mile].\n\n    So this morning he said to me “We’re going to go five.”\n\n    I said, “Bruce, I can’t go five. I’m a helluva lot older than you are, and I can’t do five.”\n\n    He said, “When we get to three, we’ll shift gears and it’s only two more and you’ll do it.”\n\n    I said “Okay, hell, I’ll go for it.”\n\n    So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and I’m okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out.\n\n    I’m tired, my heart’s pounding, I can’t go any more and so I say to him, “Bruce if I run any more,” — and we’re still running — “if I run any more I’m liable to have a heart attack and die.” He said, “Then die.” It made me so mad that I went the full five miles.\n\n    Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, “Why did you say that?” He said, “Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it’ll spread over into the rest of your life. It’ll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you.

{"body":"The motorcyclist has all the body language of a new rider panicking.

It can be done but it takes skill. In the newbie motorcycle safety course they tell you not to try. Set the bike upright and stop, or lean further and continue slowly rolling on (increasing) throttle to swerve around the obstacle. \n\nThe motorcycle rider appears surprised to see the cyclists and taps his brakes mid corner while leaned over. The bike immediately wobbles. The rider lets got of the brake and sets the bike upright to correct the wobble, but now he's drifting to the outside and no longer braking. He's headed straight for the cyclists now and he panics and freezes. \n\nHe could have set the bike upright first and come to a hard stop. This would put him on a collision course, but with proper braking he would have stopped before colliding. Once sufficiently slowed, he could have resumed cornering and passed to the inside if space was available. \n\nHe could have countersteered more, increased his lean angle, and rolled on the throttle (gentle accelleration) to stabilize the bike and passed to the inside. This would of course only really work if there was space to the inside of the curve. If the cyclist was in the middle of the lane this strategy would likely fail. \n\nIn the video, the novice rider does neither, and crashes. ","score":"39","subreddit":"funny"}

{"body":"The reason is manifold but ultimately a matter of preference. The problems with the side launcher:\n\n* If you have auto-hide ON and you launch a program from the launcher, it spawns behind the launcher (the window controls are inaccesible). You have to move the cursor away from the launcher, wait for the launcher to disappear and then close or minimize the window.\n\n* The Back-button in browsers is located to the left but isn't bordering any edge anywhere. This makes it harder to hit, because you can overshoot the target. There's a law that describes this called Fitt's Law. This is especially a problem if you have auto-hide on, because then the user will move the cursor in the general direction of the back-button and hit the edge of the screen - This un-hides the launcher and covers the back-button. The user has to move the cursor away from the launcher \u0026gt; wait for autohide \u0026gt; click back button.\n\n* If you have the launcher on Always Show, then the window becomes disjointed when you maximise it. It's hideous and weird. It's one of those things that trigger the ever so slight OCD that some people have.\n\n* There are the multi-monitor problems where the launcher is hard to hit and it's also obstructing cursor movement from one monitor to another.\n\nAdvantages of bottom launcher:\n\n* It makes everything more centered. Symmetry is pleasing.\n\n* If you have it on auto-hide you have the same advantage of screen-realestate as the side-launcher, without the problems of accidentally spawning the launcher while wanting to do something else.\n\n* Very few (i can't think of any) applications have menu's or icons at the bottom, so you there's less risk of misclicks.\n\nBottom launcher solves the problems of the side launcher and it has its own advantages. The problems CAN be solved by \"just using it differently\" but that's why it's a matter of preference. When we use a desktop, we aren't 100% aware of how we use it - we just do what's habitual and habits are hard to break. When Canonical suggests that the user should just act differently they are making the user problem, not the machine. I am of the firm belief that we are supposed to build machines that fit humans not tell humans to fit machines. You can also discuss the degree to which you need customizability. There are good reasons to use the side launcher but there are good reasons to use the bottom launcher too. There is no good reason not to have it. That's why there's a lack of customizability if you can't choose between the two.\n","score":"33","subreddit":"linux"}

Illusion guy didn't communicate that he messed with the Wraith Hand's family to Leader. Because Wraith Hand is leading a new life MC doesn't know he is a legendary fighter only that he once worked for the Valley. MC walks in saying he is looking for someone to which he wipes out half the Valley immediately because they threaten him and he doesn't know what the Valley are. The Leader tells them not to report all the little things to her so they don't mention it to her despite the fact MC is causing earthquakes. Sword guy thinks MC is there to kill him because some randoms told him.

The Cold War is in full swing, brinksmanship has everyone crapping their pants...but somehow, the astronauts and cosmonauts, while living in separate bases on the Moon, are paragons of détente.\n\nHow, the official asks the commander of the American base, is this possible? Is there some lesson to be learned here on the Moon and carried back to a troubled Earth? But the commander is too preoccupied to answer straightaway--he's checking his watch, putting everything away...and why, the visiting government official wonders, do the walls have multiple repairs and re-repairs and re-re-repairs? Just then, an alarm sounds and the base commander advises the official to take cover.\n\nBang! Pow! Multiple projectiles come slamming through the walls. Soon, an all-clear alert sounds, and damage control personnel quickly re-re-re-re-repair the walls in the commander's office before all the air escapes into the vacuum. The commander and the official return to their chairs. What the *hell*, the official asks, just happened?\n\nThe commander explains that shortly after both rival bases were in operation, fighting broke out between the American and Soviet bases. But the bullets that had been fired that day didn't fall to the ground. The bullets remained in orbit...just a few feet above the lunar surface. The orbiting bullets remain a continuous hazard to both bases. The rival lunar forces *must* cooperate, because additional salvos of spent bullets orbiting the Moon would make the two bases uninhabitable.\n\nBut, not to worry, says the base commander. Some of his men are secretly building a stout wall that will soon be erected at a moments' notice to intercept the bullets currently in orbit, and any future bullets.

{"body":" \u0026gt; Stop Johnny communist guessing projects from their names like they had with a couple of American bits. \n\nIt was inspired more by British successes in inferring details of German projects during WWII.\n\nMost famously, a  smart-aleck codename revealed a technical detail of a new radio navigation system in development by the Luftwaffe.\n\nRadio navigation had been used before, to guide bombers to English cities. It allowed bombers to operated under cover of darkness, when they were much harder to intercept, and yet achieve accuracy that was sometimes greater than visually-guided day bombing.\n\nBetween the 14^th and 15^th of November 1940, radio-guided bombers attacked Coventry and destroyed most of the city in a single night, losing only one aircraft. However, the British worked out how to jam the existing system shortly afterwards,  leaving the Luftwaffe looking for a new one.\n\nIn decrypted Enigma signals, they were heard referring to a new system, then in development, as \"Wotan\". A specialist in German literature at Bletchley Park pointed out that \"Wotan\" is a German name for the wise, *one-eyed* god Odin.\n\nAll existing radio navigation systems relied in some way on the intersection of two different beams of radio waves, transmitted from highly directional antennae at greatly separated stations. In short, bombers would fly along one beam, and release their bombs when they detected a second, intersecting beam. Range was thus set in a way analogous to the way distance is obtained in binocular vision - angles drawn from two known points. British intelligence guessed, correctly, that \"Wotan\" would use only *one beam*, along with some new way of accurately measuring distance.\n\nWith the help of this clue, it was possible to discover how the new navigation system worked so quickly, that it was jammed on the very first night it was used against British cities (previous systems had not been defeated until equipment was recovered from crashed bombers and reverse-engineered, both of which could take some time).\n\nWith no period of unimpeded bombing to contrast with the effects of jamming, a hilarious situation was produced: the Luftwaffe did not initially realise the system was being interfered with at all, and the aircrews and ground station each accused the other of not operating the equipment properly.","score":"55","subreddit":"space"}

Make the crust: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8 by 8 inch pan with butter or shortening and line with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Pulse the butter, flour, both sugars and the salt in a food processor, or cut with a pastry blender, until the dough comes together, about 1 minute with a food processor or about 3 minutes with a pastry blender. Press evenly into the bottom and about 1/4-1/2 inch up the sides of the prepared pan, making sure there are no cracks. Bake until the crust is lightly golden, about 15 minutes.\n\n2. Meanwhile, make the filling: Whisk the whole eggs and yolk, sugar and flour in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in the lemon zest and juice. * I recommend using the full 1/3 cup of lemon juice for a nice balance between sweet and tart, but if you like it less tart then add 1/4 cup. Taste and adjust to your liking. Remove the crust from the oven and reduce the temperature to 300 degrees F. Pour the filling over the warm crust and return to the oven. Bake until the filling is just set, 25 minutes.\n\n3. Let the bars cool in the pan on a rack, then refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Lift out of the pan using the parchment and slice. Dust with confectioners' sugar right before serving.\n\n4. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.

{"body":"When answering this question, there is an great degree of speculation as we know so little about the level that AJ is operating on. We know he has power. We know he can box if he chooses to do so. But that's it. We don't know quite how good his chin is (although he took the left hook from Whyte relatively well). We don't know what he looks like late in a fight. And we don't know what kind of heart he has, and if he can overcome when things aren't going his way.\n\nThat being said, I pick AJ.\n\nI realise this is, at least among the hardcore boxing community, an unpopular opinion. Traditional thinking is that Fury beat Wlad, so he should beat the less experienced Joshua. Here is where I think the old saying \"An absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\" Comes into play. I do think there is an element of responsibility it going with the fighter we know more about. The fighter who has achieved more. The fighter who is the champion. However, I do feel as a community we often overlook the young challenger. Not to draw any direct comparisons between the fighters, but the community was certain that Sonny Liston was going to obliterate Cassius Clay and we all know how that turned out. Even more recently I remember the majority of people on here being absolutely convinced that Lucas Matthysse was going to destroy Danny Garcia.\n\n(as an aside, I realise AJ is almost as old as Fury, but he is undoubtedly younger in boxing terms)\n\nAnyway I've yet to actually articulate why I think AJ will win. Honestly, I think his power will be too much for Fury. The angle I am coming from is that Fury will eventually find himself on the end of an AJ right hand, and when that happens, he will struggle. Of course, you could be of the opinion that Fury will box responsibly enough that this never happens; and I think your opinion on this very much decides which side of the argument you fall on.\n\nLooking back at the Klitschko fight; no doubt Fury did a great job. However I would argue that a) Klitschko has started fade and b) Fury is *the* worst stylistic match up for Wlad. \n\nTo expand, Wlad did not look remotely good against Jennings, who is very much a B level fighter. Age catches up to boxers relatively quickly, and I wonder if Wlad hasn't started to fall off the cliff. He is of course still a quality boxer, the only point here is that he has past his peak.\n\nThe second point is really the most important one. We know that Manny Steward built Wlad up to be a super effective machine. Fighting behind a stiff jab, and clinching when up close to protect his vulnerable chin. So much of what Wlad did was predicated on him being the bigger man and/or by far the better boxer. Against Fury, he was the shorter man, with the shorter reach. No longer could he stay in his comfort zone of jabbing on the outside, and then leaning all over his opponent on the inside. The tables were really turned, and Wlad, so set in his ways could not adapt, nor did he have the boxing mind of Steward in his corner to help him adjust in his preparations.\n\nIf you want to beat this new improved Fury, you are going to have to take some kind of risk, and let your hands go. If you don't you are just going to be jabbed to death while not being in range yourself. I believe AJ at the very least will try to attack Fury. He has showed a willingness to get into a scrap (for better or worse) and I don't think we will see a repeat of the Wlad fight where Klitschko was reticent to take any risk at all. I am not convinced about Fury's defensive ability. It was always a weak link for him, and while he has worked on it, he hasn't fought anyone who is even remotely capable of exploiting it.\n\nI'm also not convinced about Fury's supposed speed. I feel like once upon a time we would say \"Tyson Fury is fast; for a big guy like him.\" At some point we just dropped the second part of that statement. I honestly don't think he has speed the way some say he does. What he is, is awkward. He holds his left arm largely straightened, and pushes it into his opponent. Sure this means it lands relatively quickly, but because he having to extend in from a bent position, the distance it travels is less. I have heard AJ being called slow by many. This doesn't seem to be the case to me. He looks much faster than Fury. Where he really loses something is that he telegraphs his punches a bit, and sometimes thinks too long in selecting his shot. However, i would bet if you measured the speed of each man's fist when he threw a punch, AJ would be vastly quicker.\n\nUltimately the argument for Fury is that he will be able to outbox AJ, and keep him out of range and off balance. The argument for AJ is that Fury won't be able to gain enough respect and he'll be able to walk him down and hurt him. Either is possible.\n\nAnyway, I know many will disagree, but I believe in AJ's ability. He is by no means perfect, but he has so much potential. I think he is ultimately a better fighter than Fury, and will prove it. At any rate, I hope time will tell. I don't think I could take a Mayweather-Pacquiao style build up. Then again, I think both men want to fight each other, and will make it happen in the next couple of years.","score":"29","subreddit":"Boxing"}

{"body":"I disagree. I thought they made it fairly obvious that he's probably going to come back to anyone that was paying attention.\n\nFirst off, how many shows kill off a character and leave the body to do nothing for a whole episode? I don't remember ever seeing it. The biggest storyline in the first episode after his death was based around the fact that no harm came to his body. Another main character (Davos) is clearly willing to defend Jon's body till the death. Why spend so much time on that plot point if he's actually dead?\n\nSecond, they made a HUGE point to tie Melisandre in with Jon's death (The episode is titled \"THE RED WOMAN\"). She looked clearly distressed to see him dead even though they'd only talked a handful of times. She mentioned that she'd seen him fighting at Winterfell. From everything we have seen from Melisandre, her magic is obviously real, and they ended the episode by making a huge point of that. It's been heavily implied in the show that her visions are real, but she doesn't always interpret them correctly.\n\nThird, if you remember Melisandre's meeting with Thoros from the third season, he explained how he rezzed Beric. Thoros' faith was at its' lowest, but his friend had just died so he said the words and somehow Beric came back to life. Well guess what: Melisandre's faith seems to be at an all time low, and her last hope seems to be dead...\n\nFourth, this is a smaller detail but they should have left it out IMO - Kit Harrington was still the second name in the credits. They aren't going to put him in he credits if all he was going to do was play a corpse for a few episodes. Charles Dance (Tywin) was in the first episode of Season 4, but he was nowhere to be seen in the credits. Plus, Kit Harrington is a highly sought after actor. If he was really dead, idk if it would be worth it to keep him around as a corpse for too long.\n\nEverything I saw from that episode pointed to Jon Snow being brought back to life.

(Arianne? for Edmure, and perhaps Baelish for Cat)\n\n3. Try to create an alliance with Stannis (agree to mutually fight the Lannisters, and then sort out their differences if they win together). Tell him that I know that the Long Night is coming, and that we will need to work together to save the realm. He still goes to the Iron Bank, hires the Sellswords, goes to the wall and defeats Mance. But this time, no need to beg for Northern allegiance, Robb has already instructed them to follow Stannis.\n \n4. Send an envoy to Dany, offer her a path to return to Westeros. Dany is, of course, a Targaryen, which could turn a lot of the smallfolk towards her, and in turn, to Robb. Well, that and her Unsullied army with 3 Dragons.\n\n5. Bang Jeyne as much as I can, try to get her pregnant. When the child is born, immediately betroth him to someone for another alliance.\n\n6. Stay at Riverrun. Co-ordinate the \"left behind\" lords to instead recapture Winterfell and begin to drive out the Greyjoys.\n\nI only really need to hold out until Joffrey dies. After that, you know that Sansa escapes - I can attack King's Landing if I choose to. Then, Tywin dies, Tyrion escapes. Cersei still becomes batshit crazy, arms the Faith Militant.. The Tyrell's will be occupied with returning peace to KL, so Robb would be safe for a while. Plenty of time to co-ordinate attacks with Stannis and his now new Sellsword army. Dany will probably take a while as Robb doesn't have the ships to transport all her men, but her alliance will be important when fighting the White Walkers. So, use the Dornish troops (if Edmure marries Arianne), Stannis' sellsword army, whatever Robb has left of his own + Edmure's to take over King's Landing..\n\nBaelish is still a wildcard and god knows what he would do, but I guess he would turn to where the winds blow, and return Sansa to Catelyn, and pledge the Vale to Robb... in return for Cat's hand.\n\nSo, Robb has Sansa and Arya (Hound goes straight to Riverrun).

{"body":"I love your essays because they focus so heavily on themes, ideologies and principles. They really are a great example of deconstructing the key ideas and themes that an author is motivated by in his writing, and how his story reflects that.\n\nHowever, that being said I feel like this is also where the predictive side of your essays fracture and break, because they are reliant on the idea that the story must exactly match the thematic tone instead of merely reflecting it. In short, there seems to be an element of confirmation bias in your work, where you have entered the creative process with your idea of what the central theme of Martin's work is and you have fit all the evidence to create a future plot that reflects that idea. \n\nNothing wrong with doing that, but it feels like your predictions are more a work of literary analysis instead of creating a plausible possible narrative. For example, your obsession across multiple essays with the idea of the Others being a true mirror to humanity is fantastic but it doesn't mean that every element of the story must fit that criteria. So when you go on to represent Jon as the Burning Dead leading the Living, this idea fits your thematic analysis but does not particularly fit a compelling narrative.\n\nMy main problem therefore, is that there is little evidence that 5 books of focus on Jon Snow has been leading up to him being a reanimated corpse controlled by his younger half-brother/cousin. There is evidence that Martin wants to explore the idea of subjugating another to your will through warging, but there is no evidence that Bran has so little moral centre that he would warg a dead relative on the orders of Bloodraven.\n\nIn your analysis, Jon becomes a fantastic thematic device that represents philosophical questions about war, life, freedom and identity. But Jon as a character has had far too much development to be reduced to such a device, a macabre puppet for a cause that will cease to develop as an individual personality. Bran is conflicted and easily led, but he's not been portrayed as a callous cannibal willing to go to any lengths to stop the Others. I find the example of the 'pork' and Jojenpaste particularly weak in this regard, because in both cases it was not by choice and in the latter he is not aware.\n\n\n**TL;DR**: I think your essays are brilliant in their examination of literary devices and themes in ASOIAF, but I feel that the evidence for such a narrative and resolution of the plot is weak at best. I'm not saying none of it could come true, but it feels like you're reading into the future of the series a resolution that would mirror what you would like to see thematically occur.","score":"102","subreddit":"asoiaf"}

One of them stridently argues, for instance, that ‘obviously’ he is guilty; otherwise he would not be arrested and charged.

{"body":"Several people pointed this out, and it's true. However, a couple things.\n\nFirst, I was talking about the traffic context specifically. Although yes, [racial profiling certainly happens there too.](http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/legitimacy/pages/traffic-stops.aspx)\n\nSecond, law enforcement officers need to have discretion, for any number of reasons. For one thing, in order to do their jobs effectively: police need to be able to respond to situations as they develop, rather than being rigidly confined to a pre-determined script. For another, the public benefits from it: do you really want to live in a world where *every time* a cop sees you break a traffic law, they *have* to cite you? Or every time they pull over some kid with weed in their car, they have to arrest them? As a general rule, it is a good thing that they can decide to go easy on you. By definition, the power to discriminate like that inevitably opens the door to discriminating based on race. But, especially if we create safeguards against that (and at least to some degree, we do), potential for abuse doesn't mean we should throw out the whole thing.\n\nThird, this kind of thing is really hard to change, for various reasons. Legal standards that give police freedom which they sometimes abuse are well-entrenched and interconnected with other doctrines: it would take a Warren Court 2.0 to change this stuff, and maybe not even that. Even if they did, moreover, courts and central authorities have limits in their ability to effectively constrain police behavior on the ground. For instance, you can strike down the stop-and-frisk program as unconstitutionally discriminatory, but it's still *really hard* for a court to get cops to stop focusing primarily on minority neighborhoods. To really change police behavior, it usually takes an engaged public (at the state and local levels, too, which is rare by itself), empowered political leaders, and reform-minded leadership in the police department itself. Plus minimal friction from all the little things that can make it harder (police unions, for instance). And even that has limits. My local police department makes a point of going the extra mile to control police behavior, especially in Terry stops and uses of force, but even then, in the moment, if a cop *really* wants to beat me up and is determined to get away with it, it's hard to stop them.\n\nThat said, it would help an awful lot if they simply legalized marijuana. I don't care a bit about arguments that weed should be legal because it's just so super, but legalization would, at a stroke, take away a major pillar of police harassment.\n\nTL;DR - good point, and shame on me for not mentioning something about this initially, but I think it's still better to have police discretion and do our best to prevent/control abuse of it than not to have discretion at all; and to a significant degree this kind of thing is unavoidable anyway, because police reform is really damn hard.","score":"18","subreddit":"bestof"}

{"body":"City cop here.\n\nHis description of the search warrant and court order process is extremely accurate. \n\nThey are generally labor intensive documents though, and a magistrate or judge has to be able to look at them, understand what crime we think happened, and how violating someone's 4th amendment protections will recover evidence of that crime. So before that documentation even shows up on reddit Inc's email or fax, it has already passed muster that probable cause of a crime exists with a third party not associated with police.\n\nIt IS common, that search warrants for electronic data are extremely broad and vague, but not by any maliciousness, because a lot of local investigators who write search warrants, primarily do OTHER types of crime. Let me explain. \n\nI know that Jimmy Two Shoes commits burglaries, steals money and credit cards and rings up a bunch of fraudulent charges, but I haven't caught him yet. Last week, he stole a rare Picasso painting of a fucked up sailboat...or something (I don't know art) and some credit cards from an old lady. Well Cletus One Tooth has been working as a confidential informant because we busted him making meth in the woods last year. Cletus has provided good information that's led to five more meth labs. Cletus comes to me and tells me that Jimmy's got a fancy fucked up sailboat painting in his garage that he says he stole and he took a picture with his cellphone.\n\nWell now I've got probable cause that evidence of a burglary exists in Jimmy's house. My CI is reliable, is knowledgeable about the criminal world, and has provided me good information before. So I write a search warrant for Jimmy house. \n\nI don't want to ask a judge to look for JUST a painting, because as soon as I find it, I have to stop looking. Also, I can't look anywhere that a painting WOULDN'T be. So I can't look in his drawers for those stolen credit cards. \n\nSo I write warrant to look for credit cards. NOW, I can look anywhere where a credit card can be hidden. Drawers, cabinets, wallets...and if I see the stolen painting, I can seize it and still keep looking for those credit cards.\n\nBUT, Jimmy likes to use those credit cards, remember? So if I see something like a film container, or a pill bottle, anything that a credit card can't fit in, I can't look inside. But what's usually associated with credit card transactions?  \nPaper receipts.  \nSo now I write my search warrant to look for a painting, stolen credit cards, and paper receipts from fraudulent transactions. Now I can look anywhere that a paper receipt can be folded up and shoved into...which is pretty much anywhere.  \n\nCops have to get creative to be able to ACTUALLY search for evidence of a crime, so we can take a small list of items, and make it broad.\n\nI once knew a detective that was investigating a guy for stealing car parts and reselling them. He wrote the search warrant for nuts and bolts, because the guy would have to remove those to steal the parts. Now he could Look for catalytic convertor parts in a CD case.\n\nSo what happens in telecommunications warrants, is they apply this same logic to companies. \n\nI'm investigating an 18 yr old for threatening to fire bomb his ex girlfriends house from a fake account. I want facebook to preserve that account, including the IP address of who created it, and all the messages it sent. But what else do people do with facebook? They log in with multiple devices. So I want all the mac addresses they have on file for that account too. People also search for people. So I want search history for everyone that typed in the victims account, and their information too.\n\nNow my warrant has become excessively broad, and not specific, and I'm wanting information for people that may have nothing to do with my crime. Yes, there's a good chance that my suspect used his own account, or maybe even a friend's...but it's too broad.","score":"17","subreddit":"bestof"}

In fact, she gets to spend much of the game exploring the world with a misfit band of friendly cartoon 'pirates', which is like a dream come true for a lot of kids.\n\n\nThey each found further motivation to want to save the world other than these reasons, though of course if he didn't save the world it would likely end in the death, enslavement, or otherwise crappy life for his friends/sister/girlfriend.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that he didn't understand the extent of the threat until much later in the game, except in Ocarina of Time.  At the start of his quest in Twilight Princess, it's just some chubby green dudes who ride boars.  That's his only threat at the start.  And then SUDDEN CREEPER HAND.  In Wind Waker, the only threat he knew of at the start was Big Bird.  Yellow punk, thinks he's the friggin' king of the street....","score":"142","subreddit":"gaming"}

In the last episode of the serie Karim Debbache (the writer and presentator) speak about Signs and propose this theory: are the aliens really hostile? Wouldn't that be dumb to go on a planet that is mostly covered in something that can dissolve your body? And he show us how the scene of the 'fight' between the neighbourhood guy and the alien at his place look more like a scene in which a cornered person tried to get away from the room, knocking everything over in the process, how the aliens, with their tall body and exceptionnal physical ability (I mean they can fucking jump on a roof in a single leap) were never shown trying to fight, be it in the final scene (doesn't try to fight the adults, no way to tell if he didn't just try to help the kid with his gaz instead of harming him) or the scene where they hide and one slip his fingers under the door (with the leg strenght that they've been shown to have he probably could have easily busted that door, but he prefer to back off once he get his fingers cut off).  \nThe aliens were maybe just looking to make contact with another civizilation and were just terrible at it.\n\nI really like this theory as it's something that never even crossed my mind when I watched the movie, but after being shown to me looks like the most logical explanation.\n\n","score":"19","subreddit":"movies"}

In a continuation of the move that had taken the first man, Corran shifted his right wrist, raised the lightsaber, and used a backhanded cut to decapitate the second warrior.\nThat blow, though grandly struck to great effect, was a mistake and Corran knew it. Though it popped the man's head off and sent it flipping up through the air, it also allowed Corran's arm to carry too far back. Sliding forward toward the next stormtrooper in line—the third of the four he faced—he wasted a second bringing the lightsaber back into striking position. He tried a high, two-handed cut that should have split the stormtrooper from outside shoulder to inside hip, but the Imp had already begun to turn toward the attack and ducked it.

You can't tell from the video but it emits directionally, but also equally from along the beam (normally audio is just emitted from a single point, so the fact that it emits it from a plane is all new code). There's also the controls for which direction is pointing. Just by looking at the code I can see that the laser is actually about 7 objects connected to each other. There's also the additional effects that go with it like particles. The beam also has to warp based off of fov and your position because otherwise it won't look right. It also applies effects to the VR screen to make it look like there's light glaring into your eyes, temporarily fading out the entire scene in the process.

{"body":"They are very close in terms of other features. Oculus has built-in audio, smaller form-factor, a bit lower FOV and slightly different fresnel lens artefacts.\n\nAt least for me, they are not all that meaningful differences. They are both accurately tracked HMDs with decent optics and the same resolution that leaves a bit to hope for.\n\nVive carries a bigger price tag, but you get room-scale with tracked input in return, while Oculus defaults to Xbox One gamepad. This is a pretty big difference to many people, at least until Oculus brings out Touch bundles.\n\nFor me personally, maybe the single biggest difference is the companies' wildly different approach to PC gaming market.\n\nOculus wants to provide extremely tightly integrated solution for hardware and software and be in full control of the user-experience. You don't buy a VR device, you buy into the Oculus platform. This is beneficial to some people, as they get the headset and have a strictly quality controlled app-store for it, essentially with the same convenience you get with a gaming console.\n\nVive is much more like a peripheral. It's partnered with Steam and defaults to it, but treats all sources pretty much equally and doesn't attempt to shield anyone from bad experiences. Developers are in control of the hardware requirements and any hardware manufacturer can implement support for OpenVR content at will.\n\nEven if it results in some crappy games making me sick and some rough corners here and there, I much prefer the latter approach. I want to be in control of my own VR experience and definitely don't want any kind of limitations for myself or the developers. Universal content on PC is key and I think Oculus Store / SDK license is taking worrying steps away from it with the excuse of protecting users.","score":"14","subreddit":"oculus"}
{"body":"Though it sucks that they're taking so long with it, I think that Rift + Touch will definitely be the best headset you can buy in 2016. The design and ease-of-use of the Vive is just really inferior, in my opinion. The way the straps look, the lack of built in headphones, the bulky and ugly appearance of the whole thing just make it a much less approachable package than the Rift. \n\nThe Rift looks classy and svelte. It seems easy to put on and take off, and all the reviews have said it's the most comfortable. Plus, the embedded headphones just make it even easier to get going with. There's just a lot going on with the Vive. \n\nIf you want mass market appeal, your product needs to be as simple as possible to use. This is why the iPhone (and other Apple products) are so popular. The Rift is incredibly easy to set up and use, and the whole thing seems to \"just work\". While the Vive is a great experience once you actually have the whole thing on, the process of getting there is cumbersome and inelegant. \n\nEDIT: So I'm guessing those with Rift buyer's remorse are the ones downvoting me?","score":"-16","subreddit":"oculus"}

{"body":"*Remember when you said you were going to scale up production to meet demand?*\n\nFor all you know they did. Seriously what do you know about it? Demand could have increased further and you wouldn't see more Rifts in the wild. And there's a component shortage. What more can be done?\n\n*Remember how you said \"Retail is a fine option... but by pre-ordering you reserve your place in line\"?*\n\nSo when he said that, it means if you pre-order you are guaranteed to get your Rift as soon as possible. At the time, that was the case. If you want for retail you are at the mercy of the retail numbers. Unfortunately in hindsight, that turned out to not be the case, but it doesn't make him a liar. I bet in a million years he never thought this would be an issue.\n\n*Remember how \"kinda shitty\" Xbox controllers are for VR?*\n\nHey, I bet he would say they still are. Doesn't change the fact that they did the right thing by developers by supporting them when that was the best interface they had available.\n\n*Remember how \"If it (Rift CV1) doesn't come out by the end of next year (2015), then something's gone wrong.\"?*\n\nSo something went wrong. Obviously. At the time, on the best information they had, end of 2015 must have looked like a certainty. What so he's a liar because things change?\n \n*Remember when the Rift CV1 was in the \"$350 Ballpark\"?*\n\nAgain, an estimate that turned out to be wrong. It sure as shit didn't do him any favours to be wrong on that one.\n\n*Remember \"if something’s even $600, it doesn’t matter how good it is, how great of an experience it is — if they just can’t afford it, then it really might as well not exist.\"?*\n\nWell obviously $350 wasn't going to get you a good enough Rift. In which case, if it was shitty, it might as well not exist either. And judging by the pissing and moaning that has gone on about a $600 product, a $350 dollar product would have been a flop. It's all good for you to sit on the internet and be a smart arse, but some people actually have to make these decisions. I bet it wasn't an easy one. Palmer is obviously an idealist, hence the $350 ballpark prediction. Doesn't make him an arsehole for being wrong about it. Oh and obviously people can afford it.\n\n*Remember when you used to \"have confidence in your product\" because you wouldn't lock down reviews months before launch?*\n\nI just really don't get this. NOBODY has been hurt by this. You preorder a rift and don't like it because you didn't have enough reviews to go by, and you end up not being satisfied with it then you can sell it and MAKE MONEY. \n\n*Remember when you mocked someone for trying to use your own DK2 with the Oculus store in the midst of a major launch clusterfuck?*\n\nOK. The shit is not designed for unsupported hardware. I'm not surprised he's snarky about it. If you can get it to work - good for you but dont piss and moan if it doesn't!\n\n*Remember when you said Rift wasn't going to have Fresnel lenses \"because they kill contrast, add a variety of annoying artifacts, and don't actually save all that much weight\"?*\n\nSo that was his opinion before, and obviously with the custom designed lenses those negatives were outweighed by the positives at which point he CHANGED HIS MIND based on a new situation. How is CHANGING YOUR MIND such a hard concept to grasp?\n \n*Remember when you said \"it is not like we just paid for exclusivity on existing games\" but then paid for Adr1ft exclusivity and Minecraft exclusivity?*\n\nA lot has been made of exclusivity and the reality is, that a) Oculus want people coming to their store to have a good experience that they can support. b) Valve do not want to support the Oculus store because they will lose sales if it becomes the default place for VR games. c) Oculus want to sell as many games as possible. The point he was making is that they helped to develop the majority of their titles from the ground up. They paid for it. Why would they give it to steam to sell and take a cut. Their business is predicated on software sales. Who the hell does work just to give it away?\n\n*Remember all the money, negotiating, and PR bullshit it took to get Minecraft to work (poorly) on Oculus? Remember how you also said \"That (Minecraft) is not going to work well directly ported to VR.\", but then you did anyway? Remember then how one person made a Minecraft mod for Vive that doesn't cause motion sickness and is much better as a VR game than your officially supported version?*\n\nSo he said it wouldn't work well. It didn't work well, but they ported it so that people who want to play it can. What a bastard. /s\n\n*Remember how it \"Turns out we’re all too different to just use one facial interface.” so the Rift would ship with multiple faceplates?*\n\nObviously again - cost vs benefit. We don't live in a fairy land where everything can be perfect and financially feasible. I'd wager that 99% of people will be ok with the current interface. It's probably best left to 3rd parties to take on the financial risk in stocking alternatives rather that just piss money up against the wall on interfaces that most people will leave in the box.\n\nHalf of this stuff isn't foot in mouth. It's just really easy to use in an acerbic manner to be a bit of a wanker really. ","score":"-26","subreddit":"oculus"}

{"body":"Nothing was off the table. \n\nI was told earlier in the day that I had 10 minutes of his time, and I wanted to talk basketball. If I would have asked him about the hiring process, that would have taken the entire 10 minutes, and he's already answered those questions. And, ultimately, I don't hold him accountable for the way he was hired. That's Harris, Jerry, and O'Neil for me. That's why I pressed Harris with direct questions about that process when I had the chance to talk to them. You can read about that [here](http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/04/10/sixers-announce-bryan-colangelo-as-president-of-basketball-operations/) or listen about it [here](https://soundcloud.com/sixers-beat/sixers-beat-bryan-colangelo-introduces-as-president-of-76ers). \n\nSo I was told I had 10 minutes. I had about 40 questions prepped. I had 8 I really wanted to get to. 10 minutes in and I was looking at my notes and we were only two questions in. So I figured I'd see if I could sneak a few questions in beyond our slotted amount of time. Follow up questions meant one more topic I wouldn't be able to get to. Since he was just hired, there was a lot of basketball theory I wanted to get to. \n\nWhere there some instances I wanted to ask a follow up question, and in retrospect wish I had? Sure. But the time constraint, and the vast number of topics I wanted to ask to get into the head of a new executive, was the reason for the lack of follow ups. It was a conscious trade off because of the unique circumstances. \n\nIf this were something more focused on a specific event, like, say, the NBA draft, it would have been conducted differently. \n\nAlso, I wanted to ask questions that other outlets haven't. If you want to hear him defend the hiring process, you can hear that on [Breakfast on Broad|97.5|97.3|WIP]. My goal wasn't to \"hold his feet to the fire\", but to try to take it in a different way than everybody else, especially considering the constraints and the unique circumstances. Ultimately, I'm always more interested in the basketball, even if the hiring process drove me insane. For me, this was an interview with the Sixers lead decision maker, not Joshua Harris. \n\n*edit: link formatting","score":"20","subreddit":"sixers"}

What exactly would people be doing online that's more intensive than what they do now?\n\nThere's no constitutional crisis - I'm fairly sure there's a clear order of succession from the president downward.

In times of national crisis due to external attack, people don't actually tend to go crazy fighting one another - the opposite happens, and people express more solidarity than usual. See for example the Blitz (or any WWII bombing) 9/11, or literally any terrorist attack. \n\nFinally, it ignores the fact that it'd be pretty clear who carried out such an attack; AFAIK it's possible, for a given sample of  Uranium, to tell exactly which reactor it came from. Presumably, the US would respond by doing the opposite of pulling its forces out of the middle east, and invade the shit out of whoever was making the threats.

If tomorrow the feral government said that I won the IRS's new get out of tax lottery, and I didn't have to pay taxes anymore, but I could if I wanted to, I think I could live with myself if I opted for no taxes for the rest of my life.\n\nIn fact, I kind of sorta did that today.  Massachusetts passed a law by referendum that dropped the tax from like ~6% to ~5% a few years ago.  The referendum had a clause in it that said people were allowed to pay the old higher income tax if they wanted to.  So, on your Massachusetts taxes you have two numbers, and you can choose to pay the new lower income tax or the old higher income tax.  When the referendum passed, it won something like 60/40.  Guess what?  Only a few hundred people opt to do that each year, and I imagine a goodly portion of those people are just confused.\n\nNo, the only real moral authority to pay taxes comes from the point of a gun.  We write laws to punishing tax dodgers to scare our selves away from doing it as much as we do it to punish people that cheat.  Delude yourself into thinking you do it out of some sense of justice if you want, but if you could get out of it with no consequence, as you can here in Massachusetts (well, get out of 20% of it), you would.","score":"-4","subreddit":"videos"}

Nice little piece l, it could also be inferred that this was the plan they had with the BoS and Maxson, how thimgs can be taken very differently by others. for example, maxson as a kid in Fo3 Admires Sarah and the Lone Wanderer, even saying he wants to be exactly like you when he grows up, but as we know there is a potential agressive side to the lone wanderers caring side as well(how franticly he searched for his dad etc and the sacrifices he made for the capital wastes) We see that Arthur has this ideology when we meet him as he tells us he cares about the people of the commonwealth, but we see an incredibly agressive side with how he deals with the institute as well, that wasn't with Sarah Lyons or the Lone wanderer in the vanilla canon. (Blows up the institute, and we can assume that he doesn't activate the evac protocol considering that it isn't a priorty with the BoS ending, also wiping out the railroad was not necessary,  and the RR questline shows that the Brotherhood actually attacks them first) So I think overall what we see in Fallout 4 in regards to what is left of what we saw in 3 is the old message of War never changes, and how the road to hell is paved with good intentions, some would say it's an edgy message, others would say it is accurate, but overall I think that it is relatively subtle enough of a commentary to remain interesting without shoving it in our face considering that we can avoid the BOS entirely.  \n\n\nEdit:sorry for spelling errors, I wrote this on my phone!","score":"15","subreddit":"Fallout"}

You roll the dice every time you eat something.\n\nIn the modern day and age your odds of being fine are extremely good, but there's always the chance that the last meal you ate wasn't okay. You won't know it while eating it, but you absolutely will know about it 12 hours later. You could eat a tasty chicken sandwich for lunch, be fine for the rest of the day, but then by midnight you could feel like you're on death's doorstep.\n\nMany of the food items you're eating are 200+ years old. Was food really preserved that long? Is the food really okay to eat?\n\nEven if you're eating only steaks, how long ago did you cook that steak? Cooked food doesn't keep forever, especially if its not refrigerated or frozen. You can grill up a healthy, tasty steak today, but after sitting on a table for a week that steak isn't going to be healthy or tasty. One more thing to consider; did the radroach you made that steak from have something bad? And remember, its a radroach. It was probably glowing green to begin with. Surely it can't be healthy to eat something that glows green.\n\nFruit and veggies can also be infested with parasites. I've seen oranges and radishes infested with worms. They looked completely fine from the outside, but once sliced open it became obvious that it was infested. Granted, you could probably eat these worms without any ill effects (other than it being horribly disgusting) because they're the kind that infests fruits and veggies rather than people, but still.\n\nWho knows what kind of parasites evolved or were created in 200 years?\n\nAlso, recall that the sole survivor of Vault 111 was locked away from the world for 200 years. He/she will experience entirely new pathogens that may not have existed in his/her time. The people of the wasteland grew up with these pathogens. They have developed an immunity or at least a resistance to them. The sole survivor is flung into it head first, going from a society that has clean water and clean food to a society that doesn't have either.\n\nIt would be like an American or European showing up at a poor slum in Bangladesh, then eating the food and drinking the water there.

{"body":"Most of the characters in the Earthsea books were of color. When they created a tv adaptation of the books they changed this however, prompting a really great response from the Author, Ursula Le Guin:\n\n\u0026gt;I had been cut out of the process. And just as quickly, race, which had been a crucial element, had been cut out of my stories. In the miniseries, Danny Glover is the only man of color among the main characters (although there are a few others among the spear-carriers). A far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned.\n\n\u0026gt;My color scheme was conscious and deliberate from the start. I didn’t see why everybody in science fiction had to be a honky named Bob or Joe or Bill. I didn’t see why everybody in heroic fantasy had to be white (and why all the leading women had “violet eyes”). It didn’t even make sense. Whites are a minority on Earth now—why wouldn’t they still be either a minority, or just swallowed up in the larger colored gene pool, in the future?\n\n\u0026gt;I was a little wily about my color scheme. I figured some white kids (the books were published for “young adults”) might not identify straight off with a brown kid, so I kind of eased the information about skin color in by degrees—hoping that the reader would get “into Ged’s skin” and only then discover it wasn’t a white one.\n\n\u0026gt;Gradually I got a little more clout, a little more say-so about covers.

{"body":"All opinion, of course. Here is mine. \n\nI would not recommend lifting weights. There is no moment in any martial art that reflects the muscle isolation that is most weight lifting. If you absolutely must lift, do explosive full body lifts like power clean, deadlift, rows and the like. Do them fast and hard, while maintaining safely above all else. \n\nMy recommendation would be to stick to body resistance work, like pull ups, planks, lunges, squats and thai squats, explosive jumping...all that.\nCardio is your best friend in martial arts. Remember, martial arts was developed for if you found weaponless in war. Meaning, you had to, and we expected to be able to fight in explosive bursts for hours without fatigue settling in. Train that way. \nAlso, instead of going to a gym, consider join a judo club so supplement your current training. Judo is one typically one of the more purist arts, and they intent behind the training is based in realism and practicality, not fancy moves and flair. \n\nI'd be happy to elaborate more over PM, or even a skype chat if you're comfortable with that. \nEither way, enjoy your journey. \n\nP.S.

{"body":"Since everyone is trying to define bulking and cutting rather than actually answering your question, here's my take:\n\nThere probably is some magical number of calories that will support muscle growth with zero additional fat gain. The problem is that it's virtually impossible to calculate because it changes daily (and in reality, it's constantly changing. We use daily macronutrient/calorie breakdowns for convenience, but if you really wanted to optimize your nutrition you could do it on a minute by minute basis). Through the course of your day you might walk an extra half a mile, or play with your kids, or drink extra caffeine or a million other small things that add up to a significant effect on your total calorie expenditure. \n\nConsidering the fact that an average male can only add a pound or two or three of muscle per month (higher for beginners, with extreme diminishing returns), the margin of error between \"perfect\" calorie intake and a calorie deficit is in the low 100s of calories. It would be really easy to hit your numbers one day and screw it up the next. In the long run you wind up spinning your wheels and making little progress.\n\nThe safest bet for consistent muscle growth is a consistent surplus of calories. That means overshooting by a large enough amount that you are guaranteed muscle growth. You just have to accept the fat that comes with it. \n\nThe opposite of all of this is also true for cutting.

It's why I've never tried cocaine or other hard drugs... I know I would like them waaaayyy too much. \n\nWhen I dieted in the past, I became an alcoholic. Or a smoker. My head wasn't on right for... well reasons I won't get into. But what I knew is that I was an addict, and that I needed help. I ate my emotions, I ate my self-loathing, I ate just to feel a brief moment of release from my pain. \n\nI got help, then I built a support group, then I researched the most effective methods for kicking addiction. Cold-turkey is it. It's the most effective long-term way to kick addiction (cigarettes, heroine, cocaine, etc...). So I struggled around a while with my addiction and realized I needed to do something drastic - I needed to find some way to go cold turkey. This diet was as close as I could get. \n\nIt gave me a safe place to deal with my cravings, my habits, my addictions - because I was doing shakes every 3 hours and did not have to think about food. After a few months the cravings subsided. When I went back on solid food I maintained my weight (improved myself even), so I know I can maintain. I know what I need to do when I hit that wall and relapse - which is exactly what happened over these last 2 months. \n\nIs there a ton of scientific evidence for doing this to deal with food addiction? No. There's just not much evidence of anything when it comes to nutrition when it comes down to it. What we have are correlations, rather than causations. \n\nAll I know is that as soon as I treated my eating as a disease - as the addiction it is - I was suddenly able to make huge changes in my life.

It gives suitably general, rigorous definitions of these three properties and then outlines a theorem that disproves by contradiction that an interpretation can have all three properties.\n\nThis has no bearing on the \"shut up and calculate\" philosophy because that really isn't an interpretation of QM, rather it is a refusal to interpret QM.\n\nHope that helps!","score":"22","subreddit":"Physics"}

There's a lot about this model out there already, but I thought I'd share some thoughts. Photos are crappy since I used a cellphone that can't macro at all, plus this watch is a true dust magnet due to the color.\n\nAlso, I'm not even a collector and this is my second automatic watch (excluding a couple of cheap fashion brand models). There's some noobness and engrish ahead (and I might compare the DSOTM to my diver a bit too much).\n\nLooking at Speedmasters\n\nI've kept an eye on it for over a year, and since it is not cheap [to me] I made sure I really thought about it. I considered the more classic Speedmasters and actually tried to convince myself that I wanted \"the real thing\", Hesalite and all, then later perhaps just a more practical sapphire sandwich, when I figured out I wouldn't have the patience to polish scratches and would miss a date window.\n\nI always liked the original 2013 DSOTM, to me it somehow looked like the hottest Speedmaster. The Omega ads did a good job, but that wasn't the only lure. This is the 2015 version with Titanium+ZrO2 foldover clasp. \n\nIt has the familiar, highly legible and recognizable Speedy face, but as a whole seems adjusted for a more practical modern use. It is popular, but not too common, recognizable, but discrete, not revered as a classic, but still respected.

{"body":"\u0026gt; It's interesting to think about the breakdown of common sense here. On one hand, it's easy to say that the kids don't understand the risks of posting online and don't really consider who else besides their friends might see their public posts. Many people do say that. But the response is that kids actually understand very well, and even though it looks like they're posting indiscriminately, in fact they're carefully controlling their online image - e.g. by showing off their families' assets. Maybe their parents just don't impress on them that their wealth is a secret, at least from the government, because they don't know where these photos are going and that's an awkward conversation to have anyway.\n\nDo you know what it takes to prove something in court?  It is not *anywhere* as simple as looking at a photo.  I'm a lawyer and an accountant.  I've gone to trial, I understand evidence.\n\nNow, if I posted a picture of myself next to an airplane, is that actual *proof* that I own the airplane?  Fuck no.  The airport is a couple miles away from me.  I can go there and find an airplane worth $500,000 or more.  If I ask nicely, the owner will probably take a picture of me standing next to the airplane.  I can then upload that photo to Instagram or Facebook.\n\nWould that photo *prove* I was cheating on taxes?  Absolutely not.  Many aircraft are owned by corporations and you only have to publicly list the officers of a corporation in the US, not the shareholders.  So it would be difficult to find out whether I was an owner or not.\n\nEven if they did find ownership, they would have to do an extensive search to find out whether or not I could have afforded it.  Maybe I had earned $1,000,000 one year (I didn't, this is just an example), paid taxes on the $1,000,000 and spent legitimate earnings on the airplane.  Or maybe an inheritance paid for it. There are many legitimate ways to buy an asset and you would have to rule all of them out.\n\nThis is not easy.  You have to have experienced investigators and you'd have to subpoena a lot of records, too.  This is expensive for governments and they often have limited resources.\n\nThere's something a little off or strange about this article.  First, it's Cosmo, which is not exactly known for journalism beyond lists of sex tips.  Second, is this really the kind of article that fits Cosmo's audience?  People aren't reading Cosmo for business news, they want fashion, sex and celebrities.  So I wonder what it's doing here.","score":"17","subreddit":"offbeat"}

{"body":"Ooh! Ooh! Is it time for me to shit all over my scumbag Govenor again? ***It is?!*** Oh frabjous day!\n\nPeople, this man is a bastard-coated cunt with fecal filling and vomit on top. He wouldn't know the meaning of \"professionalism\" if it slapped him in the face. With it's dick.\n\nExample time!\n\n* In his first term, he was trying out a defense contractor's flight simulator and was asked if there was anyplace he wanted to go. He said \"I want to find the Portland Press Herald (Maine's biggest newspaper, which makes a point of calling out LePage's almost constant shenanigans) building and blow it up\".\n\n* Later, he forbade anyone in his office to talk about the Press Herald and two other popular newspapers that hold him accountable for his bullshit.\n\n* He opted the state out of a federal food stamp program that is designed to help food stamp recipients who are looking for work by extending the amount of time they can receive benefits while unemployed. It costs the state *absolutely nothing*. He opted out of it because of his own personal bias against welfare.\n\n* Expanding on that, he is staunchly opposed to anything and everything that aids the needy. He thinks that because *he* was able to pull himself out of poverty, *anyone* can, regardless of how much stronger the economy was when he did it. To him, those who can't, even if they're working multiple jobs and 40+ hours a week, are lazy good-for-nothings who are intentionally exploiting honest, hard-working, god-fearing republicans.\n\n* He has hired his daughter and brother-in-law to state positions they have no qualifications for. Oh, and his daughter receives a $10,000 housing stipend, *even though she lives in the damned state house*.\n\n* He accused Obama of \"hating white people\" and felt that he was \"being held hostage by special interest groups\" when the NAACP requested he meet with black prisoners on MLK Day. He went on to say that they could \"kiss my butt\".\n\n* He made a proposal to the state legislature that private, religious schools be allowed to receive state funding.\n\n* After being called delusional by a democratic state senator over a ridiculous budget proposal he told this Senator, a former logger, to \"go back into the woods and cut trees and let someone with a brain come down here and do some good work\".\n\n* A state House Speaker was hired by a charter school to be their next president when his term ended. LePage responded by threatening to withhold half a millions dollars of funding. Seeing as they would lose matching funds from the private sector if this happened and be forced to close, they fired the Speaker. As this is effectively blackmail a criminal investigation and impeachment proceedings were launched, but both were stalled and eventually shot down by state republicans.\n\n* Last summer, for the sole purpose of gumming up the works in retaliation for the House and Senate not playing along with some of his proposals, he vetoed over a hundred items across various funding budgets, forcing state legislature to vote to sustain or overturn his vetoes on each and every item (*twice*, once for each year in the budgets) within five days.\n\n* This January he was speaking about the state's heroin problem and referred to drug dealers as \"guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty; these types of guys, they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road\".\n\n* He has also said \"if I didn’t know better, I was a real cynic, I’d think that the Democrats like drug dealers\" and \"everybody in Maine, we have constitutional carry, load up and get rid of the drug dealers\".\n\n* He tried to push legislation that would lower the minimum work age without a permit to 12, and restrict the wages of workers under the age of 16 to $5.25/hour.\n\n* He has pledged to veto bills allowing same-sex marriage and transgender rights. Thankfully, we got the former issue on the ballot via voter referendum and it passed in 2012.\n\n* He backed and pushed for the relocation of Portland's DHHS building to a location that is substantially harder to get to. By bus, which is now the only option for people who don't have access to a car (which is most welfare recipients in the city), it now takes forty mintues and two buses to get to and from the building and that's on top of heinous wait times. The working poor can't afford to take half a day or more to jump through these hoops and neither can the job-seeking unemployed.\n\nI could go on for days, honestly, but I have to stop somewhere.\n\nI'm ashamed my state has voted for him twice, but take some solace in the fact that he never got a majority of the popular vote.\n\nBut just to be clear: He's a scumbag, he abuses his power and he's a bully. \n\nAnd he smells. ^^I ^^imagine.","score":"36","subreddit":"offbeat"}

It's all about consistency, you know - spend at least 30 minutes per day on the couch, and you'll be lapping everyone within a year.\n\nYour ice cream / Doritos / beer goal is doable within a year, but it's quite ambitious, and I think you may be setting yourself up for failure. I'd set smaller goals at first, and tackle them one by one - for example, rather than tackling a full day of couch sitting directly, aim for a few local 6-hour beer drinking sessions at first, get some experience in, and then preprare for longer events. I'm not saying you can't do it - I'm a fairly average guy myself, but I managed to watch all of Firefly in one session last month - but it took years of deliberate consistent training to get there. The last thing you want is falling off the couch, or drinking yourself into a coma - that's just unpleasant, and will ruin couch sitting for you forever. Instead, take smaller steps and enjoy the ride.\n\nOh, and before I forget: do yourself a favor and fix your diet. The occasional pizza and beer won't cut it, if you want a proper couch potato physique, you need to make some radical changes.

{"body":"Cool! I'm the lead health educator in a teen pregnancy prevention unit of our community health center. We get teen birth reports every two years, I believe, and we've been seeing steady declines for quite some time in communities that run the same program that we are funded by. We teach comprehensive reproductive health in the local high school and community orgs. A few thoughts:\n\n- Many communities are seeing different effects based on native born/immigrant status. For example, in our community, our black teen birth rate has been far, far below all other demographics, and our black community is largely immigrant/refugee rather than native born. We wonder if there may be some protective cultural factors in this population. There is a similar but smaller effect for hispanic/latino populations: native-born hispanic/latino teens tend to have higher rates in our area than immigrant hispanic/latinos. \n\n- In our state, Asian youth have such a low birth rate that it's not even reported. However, our city accounts for 50% of the ENTIRE STATE'S Asian teen birth rate; we suspect this may be because our Asian population is largely 2nd and 3rd generation refugee populations. This is difficult for us because this population is not identified as a target group for funding, yet these births represent nearly 1/5 of all of our total teen births. \n\n- I would still love to see some data on teen pregnancy, rather than birth rates, or see some GIS style data on teen birth rates and proximity to abortion services (and access to public transit options, for example). \n\n- Our birth rate is still quite high but we manage to bring it down at a rate of about 15-20% per reporting period, which is great! This rate is higher than the state average and we attribute it to a few things you all might find interesting:\n\n1. Of course, comprehensive sex ed IN schools and community organizations. \n\n2. Free condom access at the high school, and many other community-based spaces. \n\n3. An on-site, school-based health center operated by our community health center that offers pregnancy/STD testing, condoms, and other reproductive services, for free, confidentially, during the school day. \n\n4. A free, confidential teen clinic right downtown at the health center where teens can get free birth control (and all other services). \n\n5. A bigger push for LARCs (long-active reversible contraceptives) over more traditional methods of BC for interested teens. A lot of young women seeking BC end up opting for the implant, which lasts three years and has very, very low failure rate. \n\n6. Collaborations with local private practice pedis to ensure best-practices for providing confidential care to adolescents, and streamlining our referrals system for outside-of-scope care. \n\n7. A huge, epic, never ending stress on cultural competency. We are a refugee city. There are 5000 students in the high school, and at last count, there were more than 49 languages spoken there. The community health center has a staff that speaks 26 of them (getting there!), and works very, very hard to make sure the staff and providers represent the community as well. This matters. It's difficult to measure, but it absolutely matters in terms of getting people in the door, and ensuring they come back. It also helps us make sure our education programs meet cultural needs. For example, hispanic families are much more likely to live in multigenrational homes where family values are strictly enforced, so we began hosting charlas, which are in-home based reproductive health workshops where a host invites us, and we bring the workshop materials to her home; usually she invites neighbors/friends, etc. so it's kind of like a tupperware party but for sex ed. These are really effective because it involves entire families in health and meets them in their spaces. \n\nAnyway I guess I am bragging a bit. I am really, really proud of the work my community is doing and like to share! ","score":"116","subreddit":"science"}

{"body":"Sorry to be a buzz-kill but I'm going to point out all of the things that are disappointing here. \n\nI read the paper that the article is referencing. The 6.53% efficiency is with respect to the solar panel itself on sunlight to electrical conversion, not in rainwater to electrical efficiency. This is pretty terrible compared to standard silicon cells (~20%).\n\nThey quote that they can get up to 80 pW (picowatt) of power from raindrops. If this was continuous, they would need a constant flux of 2x10^12 (2 trillion) raindrops per square meter continually hitting the surface to get the equivalent power output of a regular solar cell (200 Watt output). Seems unlikely to me.\n\nThe other thing is that this only works for salt water. Pure water has no effect. I don't have a good feel for salt concentrations in rain water, but they require a concentration of 1 - 2M NaCl in the water. Thats 60 - 120 grams of salt per liter. Seems like some pretty salty rain water.\n\nThe weird thing about this cell is that it needs to be turned over in order to convert energy from raindrops. That means you can't just mount these panels, but they must be actively flipped when it starts raining. They did say that it is ~4% efficient even while illuminated from the bottom, you you could technically just mount them upside down. \n\nFinally, this requires direct contact between the cell and the rain. All cells need to be encapsulated in glass for environmental protection. This also seems like a pretty big practical barrier.\n\nEdit: Actual paper found [here.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201602114/full)","score":"673","subreddit":"science"}

{"body":"I posted this a while back in a thread about police costs, and thought this would be a fitting place to repost it:\n\n\u0026gt;The police budget has almost literally doubled in 14 years, and during that 10 year period we went through a global recession. Even if you account for inflation and population growth over that same period it doesn't make sense. Inflation + population growth works out to about 46.7% over the time period (approximately), whereas the budget has increased about 91.4%. In dollars, based upon inflation + population growth you'd have expected it to increase by about $280 million, but in reality the budget has increased roughly $549 million. So ya, that's a difference of about $268 million greater than what you'd expect. Have fun explaining that. And the second anyone tries to lower their budget they'll be on TV screaming that Toronto will be less safe if the budget is cut. Sure, I bet we'd also be safer if their budget was double what it is now, but that doesn't mean it's reasonable or justified.","score":"21","subreddit":"toronto"}

Any conduct by a police officer that goes beyond their job description of safely affecting an arrest of a bona fide suspect in a criminal investigation so that they can face the courts needs to be tried in an open court.

The result of those studies? Yup, torture is largely ineffective at producing actionable intelligence. The FBI at the outset of the war on terror did conventional interviews and received a deluge of information. Then intelligence was handed over the the CIA, who did an \"enhanced interrogation\" and the same source shut right up.

The movie still holds up. The animation is sleek and the acting from Bob Hoskin is great. I never once thought he was talking air through the scenes.

{"body":"Absolutely not. Including in film elements of philosophy or raising questions is fine, but if you shoehorn in a moral or less, it's probably going to be weak, and if that's the entire purpose of the film then you have a fable instead of a story. The problem with fables is that they're insubstantial--the whole thing is just a means to an end, and they're unsatisfying unless the end (the moral) is what you wanted. \n\nThink about the things that film is about. Is it about:\n\n* Visual presentation?\n* Storytelling?\n* Characters?\n* A theme or idea?\n* Excitement/entertainment?\n* Winning an argument/convincing someone of a point?\n\nOne of those things doesn't match up, and it's also the one that a lesson or moral hinges upon. When a work of art is too centered on a lesson or moral, it's called didactic, and it's not a good thing. Including some kind of message or lesson or whatever is fine, but definitely not necessary and it definitely shouldn't be the focus.","score":"14","subreddit":"TrueFilm"}

It is possible that an adult unfairly manipulates a certain 12 year old into giving him her chastity. But the girl's age alone does not determine whether or not she was coerced. Many 12 year olds are perfectly capable of making their own decisions. Many 12 year olds are motivated by their own sexual urges to have sex with men. When an older man and a 12 year old girl have sex, it is not impossible that she was not coerced, or even improbable. To assume call a man a coercer simply for fucking a 12 year old is to arbitrarily assume guilt. I thought people were innocent until proven guilty.\n\nThings are different when the girl is under 10. 10 year old girls rarely seek own men by their own sexual urges. When a girl under 10 has sex with a grown man, then in the vast majority of cases she was coerced or prematurely corrupted. It's fair to assume guilt in this case, which is why many states in the 19th century rightly set their age of consent at 10.","score":"-6","subreddit":"Truecels"}

It is the easy, and ignorant way out. There is a reason it is called \"Blind Faith\".\n\nMost of us here did not become Ex-Muslims all of a sudden - it is a gradual process. A process of learning, questioning things, finding answers, comparing them and then accepting the fact that religion is nothing but man's own invention.\n\nIf someone can claim to be some kind of \"prophet\", I would give that title to people like Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, and countless others who have advanced the human race beyond our wildest imaginations and told us things we could never know.\n\nWhat were the contributions of Muhammad to man kind?\n\nScience taught man how to fly and put him on the friggin MOON within 100 years of learning how to fly.\n\nScience sent a spacecraft to Pluto and captured photographs of it.\n\nScience built a telescope that captured photographs of the universe from 13 billion years ago.\n\nWhat were the contributions of Islam, or any other religion for that matter, in this same context?

Also, don't tell me the old \"but the verses are not literal\", \"the context is different\", \"Quran has scientific miracles\" because all of these points have been debunked again and again not just by us commoners here but by reputed scientists and academicians worldwide.\n\nI'll give you another thing to wonder about. It is scientifically proven (and seen in real world) that COUSIN marriage results in a very high chance of deformed / mentally challenged kids. Google Pakistan cousin marriage statistics etc to confirm this.\n\nYet the Quran doesn't say anything about this or forbid Cousin marriage at all.

And then bipolar disorder was a bitch, I got hypomanic and then depressed and my eating got beyond fucked. 3 hours of exercise a day, eating \u0026lt;600 cal a day, massive 3000 calorie binges followed by gulping down laxatives, and so on. \n\nI ended up admitting myself to the hospital for suicidal ideation, and was diagnosed with EDNOS. As my mood stabilized, my compulsions and obsessions about food got better, and I became terrified of counting calories and exercising again. I convinced myself that I shouldn't start doing it again, because disordered eating is awful. It feels like shit.

{"body":"[Ranger](http://imgur.com/AzKl35O) is a 5 year old black lab that I adopted (much to my household's dismay) in January. He had a host of issues including being very underweight (55 pounds), anxiety, lack of confidence, no house training/crate training, trust issues and food obsession. In addition he was also treated for heart worms. I took him in and began an aggressive training regimen and I learned a lot from helping him out.\n\nConsistency is key. Regular bathroom breaks and feedings helped curb Ranger's tendency to freak out when no one was around and vacate on the floor. My vet also prescribed Prozac to help out which did wonders as well. He hated his crate especially (which is indicative of past neglect since his teeth are ground down from years of trying to chew his way through metal), but after short bursts of crate training in a comfortable, secure crate Ranger eventually learned that being outside of a crate is way more preferable to being inside one. After about two months of trial and error, Ranger is now perfectly content with being left alone to free roam around the house for hours.\n\nAnother thing I gave (and encouraged members of my household to as well) was unconditional love and positive reinforcement. Ranger is an excellent dog. He doesn't need a leash, listens and follows me around constantly. I also let him sleep with me every night so he knows he's not alone in a dark room. Working on these things and showing him how good of a dog he really is really boosted his confidence to where he's always thumping his tail and warms up to new people. He does however have a serious problem with males (which is weird because I'm a male).\n\nI also provided him with steady, healthy weight gain through a variety of methods. I worked in a restaurant until last month and after mentioning to my coworkers how Ranger needed to gain a lot of weight, everyone pitched in by saving scraps of fish, chicken, pork and red meat for me to give to him. A little meat plus steamed vegetables really helped put the pounds on him. Last week, he topped off at 81 pounds. A little chunky, but I think it's the perfect stopping point for an older dog like him. \n\nBasically, I wrote this all out because I've heard a lot of people say that untrained older dogs are usually too far gone to retrain or integrate into a new household. I don't think that's true. Sure, every dog is different and some dogs may in fact be too aggressive or broken to the point of serious emotional damage. But training Ranger showed me older dogs can be the best compadres you can ask for. I'd take training Ranger again over training a puppy any day. The results speak for themselves.

The 2015 deck Plunder the Graves is considered the strongest one in that set, because none of the other cards have graveyard hate cards in it, which can cause Plunder to run away with the game very quickly.\n\nSo out of the box: It is probably better to keep the decks within the same year.

Would you also say that things like getting a nose job are \"deceptive\"? \n\nMake-up isn't always deceptive either. Sometimes people use ALOT of makeup, but you can usually tell in those cases making it non-deceptive. Obviously no one has natural eye liner wings on their eyes. Makeup is mostly used to cover up more minor imperfections like red spots and such to make a person feel more secure. Why is that deceptive? You should also realize that people don't always wear makeup just to impress people, in my experience it's to feel good about yourself and not worry about things that make you insecure like dark circles and such. \n\nThe connotation that makeup is \"fake\" or whatever is annoying. Guys can wear makeup too, though it's not nearly as common. While I do agree that an overdone makeup job is too much (personally), it's not like whoever has said makeup job is just dying to impress you or make you like them.\n\nAlso believing that makeup is only ok if it's used for cosplay or fun is actually extremely stupid. There's many different reasons to use makeup and none of them are wrong, so stop acting like your opinion should be some kind of general rule of thumb for makeup. \n\nWanting a girl who doesn't wear makeup because you want to only see their natural face seems obnoxious. It's not your decision if a person wears makeup or not, and it's also not for you.

This requires some effort, so I was pretty upset when I **noticed all my reports had been CLOSED except for the original report, weeks old, because the reports were DUPCLIATE QUESTIONS.**  So after weeks my ticket for the first player I reported is still open, he's not banned, and the other reports are closed with no action taken against players.  \n\nWith some vital items like ammo, weapon fire rate, and location (noclip) on client side people can use a basic trainer to easily hack in the game.  Combine that with the aimbot that seems to be bundled with these most the time and the game is becoming unplayable in the pvp Dark Zone.  \n\nI personally Love the game and the DEVS seem to be actual pc gamers which makes the hacking issues even more frustrating because they should know better.  If they take a serious stance on hacking and implement a competent anti cheat I would love the game.  Overall it offers an excellent RPG/Shooter experience but I made this video out of frustration and what has appeared to be a lack of action taken by the devs so far when it comes to hackers.","score":"138","subreddit":"pcgaming"}

Consider it a base defense mechanic, and a much needed one at that. \n\nI watch all these videos where a team of 8+ dudes raid a base with one or two sitting duck occupants but it drags on for like 30 minutes because they brought a pitiful amount of rockets and C4 and have to keep sending people back to their base to grab or craft more. And by the time they get inside, the loot has been despawned and of course they get salty about it as if they're entitled to the loot after an embarrassing clusterfuck of a raid.\n\nDespawning is a mechanic that makes raiding uncertain and risky, as it should be. There are many reasons for raiding bases: evicting unwanted neighbors, establishing dominance, undermining rising clans, and of course, loot. Since loot is the most rewarding aspect of raiding, it must require maximum effort to earn, and less room for error. If you spend more resources raiding a base than you were able to loot from it, whose fuckup is that?  ","score":"-5","subreddit":"playrust"}

At a recent rally he said he would like to punch a protester in the face. This is by no means an exhaustive list.\n\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; \u0026gt; Almost the only policy Mr Trump clearly subscribes to is a fantasy: the construction of a wall along the southern border, paid for by Mexico. What would he do if faced with a crisis in the South China Sea, a terrorist attack in America or another financial meltdown? Nobody has any idea.\n\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; \u0026gt; [...] There is nothing in Mr Trump’s career—during which he has maintained close control of the family business he runs, and often acted on instinct—to suggest that he would suddenly metamorphose into a wise chairman, eager to take counsel from seasoned experts. For those who have yet to notice, Mr Trump is not burdened by a lack of confidence in his own opinions.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; He's also got a rabid following of white supremacists (ever look at the audience at his rallies?) who have been very public about how he's the best candidate for them since the civil war and has retweeted quite a few of their comments. David Duke told his supporters that to not vote Trump would be treason to your heritage. Trump, who called Duke a neo-Nazi he doesn't want to be affiliated with back in 2000, now pretends like he doesn't know who he is or just sarcastically says \"I disavow, OK?\" in his trademark exasperated tone. Trump's supporters get the message loud and clear. He engages in shameless fear and hate mongering. He repeats every conspiracy theory since he knows the wingnuts on the right believe many of them (like the Scalia being assassinated bit... as soon as the rumors began to spread on those right wing sites, I immediately knew Trump would reference them and within days he did). He recently retweeted a quote of Mussolini, then owned it and said he knew who said it. The quote itself is not too controversial, but not entirely harmless. It's especially troubling in context as it captures the sentiment used by ambitious conquerors, even terrorists.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; His debate style is to insult people like a middle schooler. Entertaining but what kind of country does that represent? Our position in the world isn't just because of our military but the world's perception of us. His election would almost certainly inject new blood into ISIS as it fits their end-times narrative that the US is literally a racist colonial empire on a crusade against non-whites.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; He pulls birther nonsense against anyone who isn't at least a second generation white protestant on their paternal side (so he's questioned Obama, of course, along with Cruz and Rubio). He doesn't think 14th amendment citizens are \"real\" Americans.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; Not to mention he said he wants to kill Edward Snowden, \"shut down\" the Internet, create a national database of Muslims (what next? make them carry special ID? that's the next step), pro-life (to keep the evangelicals in his corner), abolish the corporate tax, thinks climate change is a complete hoax (as in, \"it's snowing here, where's the global warming?!\"), cut funding to the EPA, do nothing about gun violence, doesn't want to raise the minimum wage, repeal the estate tax, cut taxes overall by $10 trillion.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; Oh, and mass internal displacement of people in the US where he wants to deport 11 million people (and seize all their money and probably remittances from legal immigrants as well and he's going to use that to pay for the wall), replace them on farms with prison labor, start refugee programs to empty inner city urban areas and send troubled or vulnerable youth from there to wealthier, \"liberal\" areas on the liberal states' dime (using their existing refugee/sanctuary programs) in order to create a non-white second class that will make whites feel secure at the top of the food chain again and make blacks feel like they can at least attain some immediate albeit limited upwards social mobility (isn't he so generous? we won't have another Obama again).\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; Direct quote of Trump from video during this campaign (Google it): \"Part of the problem is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.\"\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; Quote of Trump about poor people (1999 NY Times): \"'My entire life, I've watched politicians bragging about how poor they are, how they came from nothing, how poor their parents and grandparents were. And I said to myself, if they can stay so poor for so many generations, maybe this isn't the kind of person we want to be electing to higher office,' Trump told Dowd, adding, 'How smart can they be? They're morons.'\"\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; Quote of Trump about women: \"Women: you have to treat 'em like shit.\" (Direct quote of him: http://i.imgur.com/xoY5wvh.jpg ) That article, from the '90s, also in the very next sentence contextualizes Donald's statement with his opinion on on Tyson's rape conviction which put the latter in jail:\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; \u0026gt; Donald is discussing his buddy Mike Tyson. Tyson told Trump the woman who put him in jail \"wanted it real bad.\" Trump feels Tyson is doing time on a bad rap: \"She knocked on his door at 1 A.M. and was up and dancing at eight the next morning.\" This speech is another of the set pieces he is so fond of delivering. When he defended Tyson and suggested a payoff and community service for the champ, his mother got so angry she raised her voice to him for the first time in his 46 years.\n\nThere are people doing Nazi salutes at his rallies (not even speaking about that pledge) and telling black people to \"Go back to Africa\". Footage of that has been airing on loop on the major news networks and some Trump supporters (a better word might be apologist at this point) have been jumping through insane mental hoops trying to pretend it didn't happen.\n\nDo you disagree with him on any of that? \n\nTrump is utterly disconnected from reality. Maybe his mother needed to raise her voice to him more often. His mind only functions in a world where he's the boss so people listen to him because he signs their checks. That is not the situation one is in while holding political office. He will have a complete meltdown if he makes it into office and realizes nobody's going to go along with any of his cockamamie plans, least of all Congress. We've seen executives like that before at the helm of countries and seen what happens.\n\nThere's also never in history been a mass displacement of people on that scale that didn't involve mass casualties (Re: deporting 11 million... which it turns out he's privately telling liberals he won't do in an off-the-record talk he had with the NY Times which he acknowledged in a debate).\n\nAlso, here's some interesting stats on people voting for Trump so far: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-voters-aversion-to-foreign-sounding-names-cost-him-delegates/\n\nSome people campaigning for him: http://gawker.com/pbs-news-story-on-first-time-trump-voters-prominently-f-1765284316\n\nTrump on freedom of speech during a sitdown with the Washington Post editorial board:\n\n\u0026gt; First was Trump’s astonishing position on free speech. He doubled down on the notion that he would “loosen” U.S. libel laws so that it would be easier to go after journalists and other writers. For example, he would weaken the requirement that aggrieved public figures must show “malice” when suing a journalist who “writes incorrectly.” He attacked stories that are “written badly” and argued that a newspaper that “writes something wrong” and fails to run a retraction should “have a form of a trial.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; He was serially unclear on what he meant by “bad,” “incorrect” and “wrong” — factually wrong? Simply unfair? When I asked him to clarify, he gave an example of television news broadcasts failing to give more details about an altercation at one of his rallies, which is not a matter of inaccuracy but of emphasis. He also kept making clear that he was concerned with all sorts of coverage he disliked. He brought up Post opinion writing to which he objected, calling it “so angry,” which suggests that purely factual issues are not motivating his concerns. After more pressure, he seemed to disclaim the notion that he would crack down on angry columnists, but he ended on this scary bottom line: “I want to make it more fair from the side where I am.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Trump’s [] talk of loosening freedom of speech protections is not just chilling in this country. [...]Trump would reset the global standard downward. He would enable dictators such as Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping to say, “I told you so.”\n\nOther quotes of his position on free speech (from the email Louis CK sent out):\n\n\u0026gt; He already said he would expand libel laws to sue anyone who “writes a negative hit piece” about him. He says “I would open up the libel laws so we can sue them and win lots of money. Not like now. These guys are totally protected.” And he said that Paul Ryan, speaker of the house will “pay” for criticizing him.\n\nAnd,\n\n\u0026gt; McCain: “At a time when our world has never been more complex or more in danger… I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our party’s most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; When Trump was told what he said, Trump said “Oh, he did? Well, that’s not nice,” he told CBS News’ chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. “He has to be very careful.”\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; When pressed on why, Trump tacked on: “He’ll find out.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; (I cut and pasted that from CBS news)","score":"-5","subreddit":"politics"}

Her entire claim to political relivance rests on her belief in universal healthcare. you would know that if you weren't a cell in dads nutsack in the 90s.\n\n\nFalse. Clinton has never supported universal healthcare.  [Even in 1992](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-119082), she dismissed the notion that we could or should push for universal healthcare:\n\n\u0026gt;In February [of 1992], Sanders requested a meeting with Hillary, “to bring in two Harvard Medical School physicians who have written on the Canadian system,” according to the records of the administration’s task force. Those physicians were Stephanie Woolhandler and David Himmelstein, leading advocates for single-payer health care.\n\n\u0026gt;They got their meeting at the White House that month, and the two doctors laid out the case for single-payer to the first lady. “She said, ‘You make a convincing case, but is there any force on the face of the earth that could counter the hundreds of millions of the dollars the insurance industry would spend fighting that?’” recalled Himmelstein. “And I said, “How about the president of the United States actually leading the American people?’ and she said, **‘Tell me something real.’ ”**\n\nClinton supports the ACA, which *is not* universal healthcare.  At best, the ACA could be extended to mandate universal private health insurance coverage.  Universal private insurance *is not* universal healthcare.  The right to pay premiums to a private company and go bankrupt if you get cancer *is not* universal healthcare.\n\n\n\u0026gt;Its easier to transition an infrastructure that supports 30 million people as apposed to 320 million, but who is counting?\n\nEurope has 750 million people.\n\n\u0026gt;was this her position, or the position of the administration?\n\nThis was [her position](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-tragic-politics-of-crime/392114/).\n\n\u0026gt;So was everybody else. plus its kinda hard to stake a policy position why you are part of an administration whose message you don't control.

Her administration, much like Obama's would not target states that have made it legal. she is also apposed to cruel nonviolent drug sentencing\n\nSo what I said was true\n\n\u0026gt;thats a lie\n\nNo, [she is resolutely against](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/23/hillary-clinton-rebuffs-liberals-push-to-break-up-banks/) breaking up the \"too big to fail\" banks.  That's not a lie, that is a fact.  [She is resolutely against](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-on-glass-steagall-right-or-wrong/) a modern version of the Glass-Steagall Act being implemented.

Trump's issue in every debate he has been in is that while he is totally willing to say anything, the things he says are shallow even by politics standards. He has proven time and time again that he really doesn't have a grasp of any issues. Bernie clearly had a grasp of domestic issues and was a bit weaker on Foreign policy, but Trump is probably the worst candidate for both of those things. \n\nHe is banking on saying as much incendiary shit as humanly possible so that people don't notice how inadequate he is in pretty much every other area.\n\nAlso, some things wont be as easy for him to attack on (flip-flopping especially) because they apply equally as well to him. He has been teflon so far because his base literally does not give a shit what he says, and he will win conservatives by a vast majority on account of the other option being Hillary. I dont know that he will continue to be teflon for independents, but worse, he is the perfect person to get the democratic base highly motivated to vote because he has repeatedly shot himself in the foot on key issues (abortion, basically anything dealing with minorities).","score":"22","subreddit":"politics"}

Basically, don't go personal, keep it to attacks on her record related to the issues he's interested in. So far, so good.\n\nAlso, use his attacks as a starting point to re-raise the issues and his ideas on them. If all he does is talk about Clinton there's a good chance it'll backfire like you're saying, but if he can use his attacks simply to pivot onto his ideas and highlight how they contrast and are better for the American people than hers, then I think he stands to gain, potentially a lot. This interview is a good indication in that area as well, I think, as highlighted by how he attacks her for taking Wall St money and then in the next sentence returns to attacking Wall St and not her (directly).\n\nIn sum, I think so long as he keeps his attacks focused on the issues and her record as it relates, he'll gain from this. If his attacks start to get personal or irrelevant, he's going to lose a lot of support, or at least a lot of the passion behind it, quickly.

{"body":"What is the huge deal? You are looking for the spin from the other side...so let me breakdown my take on this whole ordeal:\n\n1. A week ago, Sanders gets invited to speak at event in Vatican City. The event is not a major Papal address; it is a relatively unknown academic conference that no American would read about or care about otherwise.\n\n2. Initially, Sanders campaign tries to stretch the truth by making this appear as if Sanders \u0026amp; the Pope are going to be together for major event. Press quickly calls BS, and the \"who invited whom\" controversy erupts. The Sanders fans think this is proof of media bias; people who understand politics realize that the Sanders campaign fucked up by overselling the significance of the event in their roll out. What is first imagined to be high profile speech involving the Pope is quickly realized to be a separate Vatican event that Pope won't even be at. \n\n3. Soon it becomes clear that Sanders may not even meet with the Pope. Initial reports made it seem like the two would be together, now it is even more embarrassing that Pope might not even see him. Brouhaha over who invited whom muddies the waters; admittedly, some of the reporting was quite unfair to Sanders, but he didn't help himself by overselling the event (see him on the View and Morning Joe last Friday--he was fully on board with the media selling this as a bigger thing than it was).\n\n4. Sanders camp, now embarrassed by politicos calling BS on attempt to get major Pope coup, can't cancel his trip or he'll look even dumber. He still says he hopes \"to meet the Pope,\" and his camp spins the event as being bigger than politics. No, no, they say, we aren't trying to sway Catholic voters in America. Some things matter more than politics!...like a 10 minute speech at an Academic conference.\n\n4. Expectations are so low, but in HUGE EARTH SHATTERING TWIST...Sanders sees Pope for 5 minutes... in a hallway...at 6am... before Pope goes out for major event to help refugees.\n\n5. Sanders fans explode..SEE! HE knew what he was doing all along! The Catholic voters will flock to us! Big deal! Pope endorses (wink, wink) Sanders!!!! This is history!\n\n6. I will agree that this is a positive story, and I take issue with press reporting it as \"Sanders claims he met with Pope.\" That's not fair. The Vatican confirmed it. But I would argue for one other grammatical tweak. \"Sanders met Pope\" seems more accurate. \"Sanders met **with** Pope\" makes it sound like they had a formal meeting to work together on some issue. But it seems more like the Vatican subsidiary had a high profile guest at a conference (Sanders) and the organizers found a way for their guest to see the Pope for a few minutes. Like when Obama got Springsteen to call Chris Christie. Because expectations were so low, this seems like a big deal...but the initial announcement sounded like it was going to be a big photo op with the Pope and an unofficial endorsement. Expectations were then lowered and now a 5 minute hallway meeting is a blessing from God himself...\n\nSorry, not seeing the importance. Call it sour grapes. Call it whatever you like. Sanders should have been in NY getting people to vote. Saturday morning news stories are the last place that people look to change their political opinions, and without a photo with the Pope, this is nothing but a nice memory for Bernie, not a lasting impact on the election.","score":"-22","subreddit":"politics"}
