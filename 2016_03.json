We had to lower it to the \"Very High\" preset.\n\nYet their Apples to Apples show its only 10% slower avg (with 10% better minimums) than 980 TI even though its a 20% a cheaper card.\n\nAnd yet when Fury X is leading by 8% back in the Far Cry Review?\n\n\u0026gt;Here we are running the game at the absolute highest settings once again so we can compare performance at \"Ultra\" settings at 4K. We once again find the AMD Radeon R9 Fury X taking the lead at 4K. **The overall average difference is small at 8%**, but the Fury X is faster.\n\nSo its a big deal when a $550 card is 10% slower than a $650 one, yet two $650 cards having a 8% difference is small diff?\n\n\u0026gt;Just the fact that a single-GPU can potentially play this game at the highest possible game settings at 4K just shows how non-graphically challenging Far Cry Primal truly is.\n\nOh right, Fury wins so game isn't graphically challenging, even though its a damn good looking game.\n\nDat anti-Fury bias [H]... its ok to say good things about the Fury, it didn't murder your cat.\n\n\u0026gt;Key forward-looking graphical features like tessellated enhanced Godrays have been removed.\n\n\u0026gt;#The Bottom Line\n\u0026gt;You've probably figured this out by now, but we will not be adding Far Cry Primal to our gaming suite for GPU testing.\n\nYep saw that coming...

Then, have them roll for damage to determine how well they were able to pull it off.\n\nIf a player swings a short sword at a Goblinoid who has 8 HP, 2 damage is quite a blow against it. \"Greykur brings his shortsword down hard on the goblin!

{"body":"It's honestly best not to think of the EVE world in terms of morality. The developers have specifically chosen for it to be an amoral and difficult world because frankly living in that world is far more interesting.\n\nThink of EVE like an ecosystem with a food web.\n\nThink of asteroids and rats like plants and fungi. They are the primary food source of EVE. Mission runners/ratters/explorers/miners are the herbivores of EVE. Highsec gankers/griefers/scammers are like the opportunitic scavanger/predator types. They're not really able to go after large, healthy prey but they are able to go after weaker prey. Their method of predation is to attack weaker prey and surprise them, often using trickery or deception. Think of alligators. The alligator sits there and looks like a log in a swamp all day, waiting for a slower animal to come for a drink. Highsec gankers are alligators, and hyenas, and their associated brethren the vultures. Now nobody fucking likes these animals, but in the greater context of the environment they live in, they serve a purpose. They keep the herbivore population from exploding and then running out of food.\n\nWithout highsec gankers the risk in highsec goes from small to zero. The problem with zero risk in a sandbox game is it allows for infinite resource accumulation. Yes, you may be making money more slowly. But you never lose money. You may have a smaller return on investment, but it is stable and perpetual. This becomes even worse when you think about what it does to demand. Why is anyone buying mining barges, mining lasers, mission running ships, ever ? If you only ever need to buy one ship and use that same ship for 10 years, then what demand is your activity creating ? The only thing you're buying are ammo and mining crystals. So what exactly are you even doing these activities for ? You grind towards your ship, you get that ship, you make isk.... that you never have to spend again. \n\nI see so many highsec people that just want to go off and do their own thing. That isn't how this game works at all though. You're part of the food web if you like it or not, even solo activities are connected in with the rest of the game, and you can't be surprised when the rest of the game comes and starts interacting back. Your best option is to be prepared. Look where you're going an don't be the slowest member of the pack.\n\nThese people aren't good, they're not honorable. You're SUPPOSED to hate them. Nobody expects the gazelle to thank the aligator when it pulls it into the swamp and takes it into a death roll, even if the result of eliminating the alligators would be population imbalance and food shortage for the gazelles. \n\ntl:dr hakuna matata, the circle of life or some bullshit","score":"17","subreddit":"Eve"}

{"body":"At this moment? No.  I'm not ruling it out, though.\n\nNo, this was just a product of me daydreaming. I was thinking about what it would be like if instead of empty space that planets were connected by a sea. A sea that you could cross in a reasonable amount of time, naturally.  A fantasy setting, mostly.\n\nBut, really, I just liked the imagery of it. *Aubrey and Maturin* in space. I liked the idea of an old fashioned wooden ship coming into port on an alien world.\n\nSomewhere along the line I thought about solar sails and, really, that clenched it. I had to do it after that. A wooden ship dragged along by an enormous solar sail.\n\nOkay, once I got that far I decided I needed some ground rules for this to work.\n\n1) No one is really any more technologically advanced than the Earth.  \n\nA wooden ship going up against the Death Star is not fun. Okay, so we'll do Robert Frost and The Road Not Taken. FTL is discovered as a simple clockwork mechanism fairly early on and, as such, everyone works along perfecting that. \n\n2)  Any and all technology that needs to be addressed that is way beyond the tech limits of the time period will be abandoned technology from a more advanced but long lost alien race.\n\nI wanted to set a scene in a goddamn asteroid and I wasn't taking no for an answer!  You say \"but the gravity!\"  Well, boom, taken care of. Next question? \n\n3) Atmosphere, gravity, and basic biology pretty much are the same on Earth as elsewhere. \n\nThis one I didn't touch on very much, but to make it more like a late 17th century or early 18th century feel I can't have them trying to use pressure suits or have right handed amino acids be the dominant pattern elsewhere. To capture the, well, feeling then places have to be pretty much like what we see here. They arrive at a port at a place that is similar enough to Earth that it isn't immediately lethal. Exotic, maybe, but not lethal. Plus people don't have to have access to advanced medical technology just to determine if something is edible.\n\nThat's partially why they are spice traders. Spice was a big deal at one time. Not just for exotic flavors. Before refrigeration spices were a huge deal. They were one of the best ways of preserving food. \n\nI had to trim the story down quite a bit from the original as it was way too big to post, but there was a side note that some of the preferred spices from Earth included cedar oil and coal tar. Why? Because I like to be strange.\n\nAnyway, after I established my ground rules I built the story around them. \n\nI could probably do another if I thought about it.

{"body":"The interesting thing is that the cryptocurrency economy is starting to much more closely resemble not just environmental economics (which it would if there was a single cryprocurrency out there), but even more so urban economics. It's generally understood in urban economics that there is a tradeoff between network effects (eg. see [the common finding](http://www.citymetric.com/business/cities-productivity-proportional-their-size-unless-theyre-british-782) that doubling the population of a city increases _per-person_ productivity by 15%) and congestion (with comes with its increases in land and transportation prices), and the result of that is that we see a power law equilibrium in city size, where people choose to live in different cities, towns or on farms depending on what their preferences are relative to the average. One-city-rules-them-all maximalism is a position that is pretty much non-existent among economists, even the crazy ones. Hence, if congestion continues to be a problem among cryptocurrencies, expect to see a similar equilibrium emerge and remain stable: even though Litecoin offers pretty much no redeeming value that makes it interesting as a project, it will likely still hold its value relative to bitcoin for a long time.\n\nAnother consequence is that [the Tiebout model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebout_model) becomes relevant: we may see different cryptocurrencies choosing different points in political tradeoff space, including adjusting the governance model, consensus algorithm, money supply, fee policy, etc, and this may end up making consumers happier as their individual preferences can be better satisfied. If we want to maintain maximum network effects in this environment, then the best choice is to let the cities bloom separately and simply build fast planes and trains - ie. optimally efficient cross-chain transaction infrastructure such as btcrelay, shapeshift, etc.","score":"92","subreddit":"btc"}

My coverage area covers part of a lake. We pull up behind the county sheriff and go see whats up. Evidently this girl was upset and got out of her foster parents vehicle and ran away. The deputies were out looking for her now. \n\nSo naturally we rereated to our unit to stage/eat our Arbys for lunch. 10 mins go by and were finishing our Arbys when we hear a knock on the back doors. Its a girl that looks to be about 15. I ask if she is the person were looking for, she says no shes down by the lake not doing good. She says theres no easy way to get down there. We grab a backboard, o2, and t pack and start hiking down.\n\nIt had just rained for 2 days so all the ground was soggy and the rocks were slippery and it sucked walking about a quarter mile to her. We finally get withing view of the pt and shes seizing and about to slide off a rock into the lake. So we start hauling ass to her. We get there, shes sill seizing and we get her on the backboard where at least she wont go anywhere. Then i realize that I didnt bring my fucking narcs with me. Well this girl i find out has been seizing for at least 5 mins with about 45 second pauses every so often. There is no way were carrying this girl back up to the truck. We call for lake patrol to come get us, we call for a bird to meet us at the dock, i send my partner up for the narcs and monitor while i stsrt the iv and put her on oxygen. \n\nIt takes lake patrol about 30 mins to get there. Ive already given 10 of valium and shes not stopped seizing. Lake patrol gets there then tried to tell me that all 3 of us plus the pt cound not fit on the boat. I told him we are. So we balance the backboard on the middle seats, i sit on the bow and my partner just kind of squats in the middle. Theres water coming into the boat like its sinking. Wtf. Everything is wet. Soaking wet. It takes about 10 mins to get to the dock. We load and go another mile to the bird. Meanwhile the pt still hasnt stopped seizing. I give another 5 of valium. We get to the bird and they are like wtf was she in the water or something? No, just a horrible lake boat. They give her some versed. She is still seizing. They take off and hopefully she made it ok. \n\nI tell dispatch we are clear and out of service until were dry. Holy shit.\n","score":"20","subreddit":"ems"}

{"body":"Game notes:\n\n* How is it so hard to get the ball in bounds?  Like seriously I don't think any other team struggles near this much with this, and it almost cost us a 15 point lead.\n* Kemba's ability to create space for himself, along with the additional 3 point ball he added this year, genuinely makes him into one of the more unguardable players in the NBA when you can't just double/triple team him.  Our mid-3rd lead was from him picking up back to back to back to back to back 3's.  And then a midrange shot and a nice lay-in.\n* Tyus Jones' inability to guard him kind of exasperated this even worse because they had to put Lavine on him opening up the rest of the offense.  This somewhat hurts the reliability of +/- for the game, though Kemba was pretty much scoring on anyone and everyone -- crossed Rubio, who genuinely is the best PG defender in the league on a normal night, pretty hard.  A lot of the points came with the bench though, hurting the reliability of +/-.\n* 75% True Shooting for the night for Kemba continues his ridiculous efficiency stretch while still putting up huge volume numbers.\n* Marvin's ability to exploit his own matchup with the relatively defensively inept Dieng was also huge in the 3rd.  7 points on 3 of 5 shooting.  Obviously wasn't Kemba's superhuman 21 in the 3rd, but was still excellent. \n* Lin got a strong extension on his lead for \"uncalled blows to the face\", but that doesn't excuse some of the bad decision-making or the continued struggles with his shot.\n* However, this is not one of the many games where he had an empty +/-.  His defense on Wiggins was solid.\n* Frank shouldn't really get a pass for his continued poor 3 point shooting either -- If he wants to be a stretch 4, he has to actually make the shots at NBA range.\n* Lots of early hands on the ball.  Within 1 early possession, Marvin tipped a ball sky high and then after the Wolves recovered it Batum immediately picked the next pass off for a breakaway layup.\n* Poor shooting start -- 2/9 with only Kemba and Marvin making early shots.\n* The Wolves continued ineptitude from 3 continues to heavily hurt them.  We didn't even shoot well and still crushed them there.  Never made it above 30% but sat below 25% for most of it.  In fact they actually shot a higher % than us and got to the line more, but the 3 point line was the difference in the game.\n* Zach Lavine has absolutely killed us twice early on now, but this time we kind of figured him out about halfway through.\n* We need to send the league a videotape of Cody Zeller's fouls and just title the e-mail \"verticality\".  Both of his first 2 fouls were not fouls, and this is hardly the first time.  The other fouls weren't exactly great calls either and once he fouled out, our inability to put out a strong defensive lineup hurt only slightly less than the inability to inbounds the ball.\n* This is a matchup in which Big Al excels, even if Pekovic, his best abuse target is out -- there's just no one on the Wolves roster who can cover him well.  Good to see those matchups still exist at times.\n* Only problem is that while Al may be able to abuse Towns, it opens up the rim for Wiggins/Lavine/Rubio/even Towns himself due to Al's own ineptitude.\n* However, Al is approaching the point where his offense may be worth it. He's starting to actually get rolls again and that makes the Alfense work.\n\n\nBut hey, congratulations to the Timberwolves keeping it close and continually fighting back.  We've recently blown out teams of a similar caliber lately, but the young talent already played like veterans at times and it's impressive.","score":"58","subreddit":"nba"}

The main issue is Dolan has refused to recognize the repercussions of those changes, but who knows if previous management would have either. \n\nThe other two big spending teams of the 00s, Dallas and the Lakers, entered the 2000s with top 5 players already on their rosters (Dirk, Shaq, Kobe).

{"body":"They've got this the wrong way round, in my mind.\n\nFirstly, nothing in LMP1 should be spec. You could allow factory engines, yes, but not spec engines. In the same way, no spec chassis or monocoque. If a team is entering LMP1, they are doing so to build their own chassis (or possibly buy a chassis) and either develop their own engine or buy one.\n\nHere's what I'd like to see: the hybrids are moved into their own class, LMPH. A privateer _can_ enter LMPH, if they want and have the means, but obviously need a hybrid system. They could either make their own or partner with a manufacturer (i.e. privateer makes the chassis and manufacturer builds the ICE+ERS. They work closely together to assure they can challenge other full manufacturers).\n\nThe current LMP1 Privateer entrants stay in the rebranded LMP1 class, which is no hybrid, bespoke chassis and engine. Both can be bought, but the class is in no way spec. A manufacturer _cannot_ enter LMP1, _unless_ there's a budget cap on the money they spend, _and_ they plan to enter LMPH the year after.\n\nThis might be fanciful, but I think it could/would work. Bit of effort on the ACO's side, but that's nothing to save LMP1 Privateer.","score":"21","subreddit":"wec"}

{"body":"Here's all the info I've compiled about the Wardrobe from tweets and blue posts from the forums:\n\nThe Wardrobe will unlock the appearance of items across your battle.net account meaning you can transmog into various armor/weapon pieces that you've acquired.\n\nHere are the conditions:\n\n1. The item must be soulbound and it's refund/trade timer must be expired.\n2. If the item is a weapon, you must be able to equip it.\n3. If the item is armor, it must be of your primary armor specialization. (Mage:Cloth, Warrior:Plate)\n4. Class Restricted Items can only be unlocked by that looting them on the specified class. (Judgement Set:Paladin must physically loot)\n\nOther info:\n\n* Quest Rewards will be retroactively added into your Wardrobe.\n* Quest Rewards from CATA and above will unlock the rewards you would have unlocked when questing on that character. (Completionists will need to do Loremaster four times; one for each armor class).\n* Class Starter Sets from Salvage Yards/Boosted Characters will have Class Restrictions added to them in Legion. (Including Death Knight and Demon Hunter Starting Gear)\n* Looted Treasures will also be retroactively added to the Wardrobe.\n* Tier 3 will not have class restrictions added to them.\n* MOP CM Gear will be available to the all characters on your account who are of the same class.\n* WOD CM Weapons will be unlocked regardless of the character class, via a purchasable token.\n* Anything in your inventory upon login during the Legion Prepatch will add items into your Wardobe that meet the requirements listed above, allowing you to safely disenchant/vendor those items.\n\nThe Interface:\n\n* The interface for the Wardrobe will be available to you anywhere from the world. \n* You'll be able customize outfits and save your favorites. \n* You still need to visit a transmog NPC to mog your equipment. \n* You'll be able to assign outfits to each spec allowing you to switch appearances as you swap specs.\n\nMisc:\n\n* Items still have level requirements, so you have to be the appropriate level to show off that transmog.\n* Items are still transmogged by item name, meaning that you will not be able to unlock the appearance of \"lookalike\" items by having the class-restricted equivalent. For example the [Tier 13 Warrior Helm](http://www.wowhead.com/item=76983/colossal-dragonplate-helmet) will only appear for Warriors on your account, unless you acquire the non-class version: [Jaw of Repudiation](http://www.wowhead.com/item=77156/jaw-of-repudiation)\n* Non-appropriate armor or weapons in your inventory will not unlock in the Wardrobe.\n\nUnknown (Not Confirmed Yet):\n\n* Use/Equip effects of Tabards (Trial of the Crusader Tabard / WOTLK Rep Tabards etc)\n* Unlock Requirements for Shirts\n* Whether or not certain white quality items will be available via the Wardrobe.\n* Holiday Items","score":"50","subreddit":"wow"}

Plenty of cultures have no issues with female nipples and in some cities like NYC, being topless is legal for both sexes. But they don't like them, so they edit them out.\n\nSome asian cultures (I'll speak from Japanese, as it's the one I know the most about, but I know they borrow a lot from China) are pretty superstitious regarding death. Anything that resembles death is considered bad luck, impolite, or downright rude. Fun examples:\n\n* It's impolite to stick your chopsticks in your rice because it looks like an offering at a grave\n* It's impolite to pass somebody food from chopstick to chopstick, because this is only ever done after cremation, where the bones of the deceased are passed from family member to family member and placed in the urn. Go look up the bone picking ceremony, it's really fascinating.\n* Puns that sound like \"death\" are avoided. The most common examples being the numbers 4 and 7 (shi and shichi). Shi is the word for death. As such, people say \"yon\" and \"nana\" instead.\n\nIt all boils down to superstitions, and removing the bones and skulls from a game is like all those buildings in the US that have no 13th floor.","score":"14","subreddit":"wow"}

{"body":"Mao never had a \"proletariat\" support. Note that Marx defined proletariat as the \"working class,\" who for practical purposes worked in industry, where they would receive enough of an education to become aware of class, and receive enough oppression to revolt.  Mao's support came from the \"peasantry,\" or the rural farmers. Marx himself did not believe that farmers, some who owned land, most who are uneducated and unaware of class relations could lead a communist revolution.\n\nMao's support of the peasantry came from the fact that many of the Chinese Communist Party saw the Chinese people, having been oppressed under imperialism for so long, as a sort of \"proletariat\" in that they were producers for international imperialistic countries. Also perhaps due to practical purposes, due to China having a very small proletariat population and thus a small base for a Marxist power base. This is why when someone is a \"Maoist\" socialist, it means that they favor a peasant revolution rather than an urban industrial one.\n\nSo why did China, a country that had been Confucian for 3,000 years eventually rally behind a leader that promised to change everything? Well, to begin we have to realize that Sun Yat-Sen, the founder of the Republic of China was not a conservative Chinese either. In fact, he was part of a generation of Chinese scholars who sought to renounce China's past and bring it into modernity by adopting what worked for many of the more powerful nations in the world. Having been humiliated after repeated defeats at the hands of the Western Powers and Japan, China went through a period of profound crisis in which its own identity and feeling of national pride was severely damaged. Out of that struggle emerged figures like Sun Yat Sen, Mao, Hu Shi, Chiang, Chen Du Xiu who mixed to varying degrees conservatism and a will to change. The important thing to note is that every one of them endorsed some sort of profound change. Very few Chinese intellectuals still believed that the \"Old Ways\" could carry China into the modern age. \n\nI just want to say that the Cultural Revolution was not itself the cause of the destruction of China's past. Nor was it the most damaging to Chinese people's regard of the past. It was merely one part of a series of attacks on China's past by the Chinese ever since their sense of national identity and worldview were shaken by the Unequal Treaties established by the Western Powers. This women here is quite ignorant of the world, but she is not ignorant of China. She embodies the same Chinese spirit that many Chinese have embodied since the founding of the ROC before the PRC. In that China is striving for a future that seemed to contradict everything in its past. In the end, I think it is unfair to label this women as a psychopath. She herself was not a significant part of any cultural destruction. She was merely caught up in the sentiments that built up for a hundred years before her.","score":"56","subreddit":"IAmA"}

{"body":"So I did a bit of personal research into the topic previously... But Psychopathy is defined differently from Antisocial Personality Disorder. Psychopathy is classically defined by the traits listed in Hervey Cleckly's work\n\nCleckly, H. (1942). The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues About the So Called Psychopathic Personality. William a Dolan; 5th edition (November 1988).\n\nIn this work Cleckly describes the psychopath as you know it from movies and books. Like Dexter, no (or little) emotional connection, but calculating, intelligent, and cold. Hannibal Lecter's character is the embodiment of classical psychopathy.\n\nCleckly's work shares a lot of traits with early psychology studies and classifications, in that they are based on a subset of case studies, extrapolated to large populations. Modern work tends to work in the inverse, find traits in large populations, hence the large clinical trials behind the DSM.\n\nIn its modern form, psychopathy is best described by the work of Dr. Hare, because he worked to design the first checklist which is responsible for the measurement of psychopathy as a construct.\n\nHare, R. D. (1998). The Hare PCL-R: Some issues concerning its use and misuse. Legal and Criminological Psychology, 3(1), 99–119. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8333.1998.tb00353.x\n\nNow the DSM describes antisocial personality disorder, which maintains many of the same qualities of psychopathy, but notably, APSD is not really associated with combined charming personality hiding a cold intelligence. You can be violent and antisocial but downright stupid and awkward. Now this is a broad generalization of course, but the main takeaway is this. APSD and psychopathy are overlapping but not identical psychological constructs. Additionally the DSM only names APSD as a specific disorder, meaning someone who was a \"pure psychopath\" according to the Hare revised check list, might be diagnosed with several aspects of personality disorders.\n\nThis overlap and difference between APSD is the subject of much debate, but the most common consensus is that psychopathy may be a subset of APSD rather than the other way around.\n\nParis, J. (1997). Antisocial and borderline personality disorders: two separate diagnoses or two aspects of the same psychopathology? Comprehensive Psychiatry, 38(4), 237–42.

Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1918618\n\nRecently there was a push for the new edition of the DSM (DSM-V) to replace classical personality disorders with a 5-factor model in which would have included several aspects of classical psychopathy. These trends towards personality disorders have not fully matured yet, and although they are very promising they were not truly incorporated into DSM-V.\n\nTrull, T. J. (2012). The Five-Factor Model of personality disorder and DSM-5. Journal of Personality, 80(6), 1697–720. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00771.x\n\n--Neuroengineering PhD student, but I would rather let my references speak for themselves\n\nJust for fun: 1) Not even going to look lol\n\n2) Dexter matches about 13/16 of Cleckly's points, if you consider him as reliable, adequately motivated, and not very egocentric/can love. So he matches this quite well. you can make your own diagnosis as you see fit.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_of_Sanity\n\n3) Psychopaths are fascinating because we always want to be suspicious of true evil and when it comes with a friendly face it kind of is all the more horrifying. \n\n4) That APSD is Cleckly's psychopathy. By technicality they are both different constructs and not the same, but the kinds of people that have APSD would not compare to the Hannibal Lecter character at all.

For example, the preferred treatment regimen for syphils was highly-poisonous mercury treatment, which involved bathing the affected member in mercury, drinking mercury and inhaling it. All of which was extremely carcinogenic, and if you watch Johnny Depp's The Libertine, which is based on Lord Rochester, you get a good feel for how destructive and ineffective the treatment was.

They got talked to about this, and got the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. A demotion to moderator for one day. ONE day. They're currently still admin on the server.\n\nAnother example is when they banned me, as a wizard, for \"powergaming\", after they spawned theirselves in with deathsquad gear and other shit like that. Pulse destroyers included.\n\nThey also talk in their own metagame teamspeak and talk shit about the players and what they see as, quote unquote \"bad admins on the server\"\n\nOh, also, that same metagame teamspeak? They were exchanging information about me as a wizard round, metagaming about me, where I was, etc. And I basically got a ban for being \"better than them\"\n\nThey've also banned a changeling for \"killing too many people\" It depends on who you ask, but admins have stated it's a \"action server\", yet them ban their players for \"powergaming\" as antags.\n\nThere is also one coder on their team that is going absolutely apeshit by making it basically xeno station 13. They changed the xeno spawn event from 1-2 xenos to 4-6 xenos, made xenomorphs have an instant kill if they are able to get a grab off of you, and a few other things.\n\nAnother thing, one of their admins are metafrieds with \"James Russle\", who literally goes on there just to greif and kill people 4noraisins. James Russle tried to kill someone on the escape shuttle, that person killed them, and then the person that killed them got banned for two weeks.

I think him Armada and Mango are gonna be the top 3 now, and if not one of them i think Armada might be replaced with leffen.  I also rally enjoy Hbox's puff play now.  Plup and Westballz i think are gonna be the players in the 7-10 range that are really gonna make waves, and, it makes me sad to say this, but m2k might to lower than top 5 this year (i would say PP too but his sickess cant last for *that* long. Can it?)  I have a feeling wobbles isnt gonna beat Armada anytime soon, and considering armada himself admitted he was playing worse than usual at this tournament, this was like wobbles only chance unless Armada gets as sick as PP somehow. SFAT is still great, but PPU really need to step it up.  How long has he the 9th place king for? (i dont think he even got 9th here tho. i think he got something lower). M2K needs to see a mental person doctor more than he does a physical doctor (maybe PP will do it for free?)

I replied that it was good that he was getting away from her and hopefully living in a better situation where he could run around and play. There was an awkward silence before she went -- with finger quotes -- \"No...he 'went to the farm'...like...the metaphorical 'farm'...\"\n\n\nIt took all of my energy not to drive the 5 or so hours out to her and beat the ever loving shit out of her.

But when you give a correction, you better have enough pennies saved up to cash in. \n\nBad trainers want to use corrections when they don't have enough equity in training built up. They don't have the money to spare, and the dogs react badly (fearful, insecure, even aggressive). \n\nYou have a significant other, right?

Now you do. You have a balanced relationship.

Build up the equity so that when you correct him, he bounces back. Or come down on him right away and hope he's invested enough in you to stick around. \n\nSome dogs (and breeds) have a personality that can \"take a correction\" and still give you 100%. I have one dog who can be corrected by a stranger and he'd still be like LOL OK LET'S DO STUFF. But my bitches would be done with you and never look back. My idiot male would be all over himself wanting to please you, because he comes with plenty equity built in. You can crank on him and he'll have plenty to spare (up to a point). But my girls? You have to earn it. \n\nA good trainer should immediately seek to build that equity, but ultimately be able to read a dog and know if a good solid correction (for unsafe jackass behavior) is okay.

He once couldn't find the rock we threw, so he dove until he found a different rock and brought that back.  He simply would not fail to bring me back a rock.

I am not 100% sure what she wants, but I would just like your opinion.\n\n\n\nHmm... I can understand what you are saying about the new bullet designs, but I still have a bias. Personally I think .45 is the best caliber for home defense, as it is a big slow bullet that is less likely to penetrate through your target and/or through multiple walls. Also while it might be possible for say, a newly designed 9mm hollow point bullet to obtain the same stopping power as a normal 45 bullet, if you compare the same newly designed hollow point - the 45 is going to have more stopping power than a 9mm. Granted, at that point it might be overkill, but I think in worse case scenario when it comes to defense. I just don't know if I could trust a 9mm to stop a 300lb man hyped up on drugs charging at me with a knife.\n\n\n\nHowever, I will concede it is a different ballgame when u are talking about concealed carry. I wouldn't be able to carry my 21 concealed, and with a smaller gun I would want ammo capacity, so I think I would be looking at a 9mm.\n\n\n\n\nI am not trying to argue, again I really appreciate your input and would like to know your opinion on what I have responded with.","score":"-3","subreddit":"guns"}

I watched her fancam prior to watching the full performance and I felt some of her movements were a bit stale(?). **Shin**, while rap-wise was not better than Cathy, she was more charming with her delivery and helped liven up the stage. I could definitely see why Shin won over Cathy however I can also understand why fans are upset that Cathy lost to Shin.\n\n**Growl**\n\n* I hate Mnet editing to the fullest but thankfully there are fancams. The ranking went as I was expecting for aside from **Haeyoung** because I didn't think that many people would go for her having both **Soyeon** and **Sua** on the same team. I still do sort of wish Haeyoung did vocals because of how great her vocal tone sounds (her voice stood out so much in *Growl*). The team did really great overall however it is sad how some of these lower ranked girls sounded like they've accepted their fate in P101.\n\n**You Look Good**\n\n* **Hyeongeun** did the best overall - I could feel her anger and sadness at the same time. Her flow was definitely the best among the three. **Ayoung** did well however I think her emotions got the best of her near the end of her rap as she didn't seem as strong as Hyeongeun's, performance-wise. **Minji** had the worst rap flow... Her rap sounded like she was just reading a piece of paper with someone else's rap on it. There was next to no emotion, unlike fellow KCONIC trainee Hyeongeun.\n\n**Full Moon**\n\n* I just had a huge grin on my face seeing Sejeong look like a proud mama when Sohye was talking on-stage. **Pinky** and **Chaeyeon** did really well as expected however I felt like Pinky had the wrong expressions for *Full Moon* and Chaeyeon still does not stand out to me at all. Overall I felt Chaeyeon and Sohye understood the concept more (and executed it well) compared to Pinky. I felt incredibly bad for **Sohye** when she apologised to Pinky and Chaeyeon for winning... I can't even imagine the number of people who hate her personally when she's not even in charge of the amount of screentime she gets in the show. \n\n**Turtle Ship**\n\n* I thought the whole group did really well however my ranking went Sooyeon (HappyFace) \u0026gt; Soyeon (Cube) \u0026gt; Chaeeun (Starship) \u0026gt; Yebin (Pledis) and this is coming from someone who has Yebin in the Top 11 votes. I felt like **Yebin** was lacking intensity compared to **Chaeeun**. While **Soyeon** has indeed great charisma and rapping skills, I felt like in this performance **Sooyeon** did a little bit better (for me personally). Sooyeon had so much swag and sexiness in that little verse of hers, I was just in awe, similar to her *Hot Issue* dance break.\n\n**Say My Name**\n\n* Overall it was a very clean and well done performance. Individually, Mina, Nayoung, and Siwon did better than Younseo and Sihyun overall. I was hoping **Siwon** would fight for the center position but it seems she's more of a team player than someone wanting a center spot. I had to pick up my jaw from the ground again after watching **Mina** - where did Jellyfish find these girls? If I were being honest, I still felt like **Nayoung** is lacking a bit in her stage presence which is why I was hoping Siwon would take the center spot for *Say My Name*.\n\n**Bang Bang**\n\n* For curiosity's sake, am I the only one who was both praising but getting a bit weirded out by **Yoojung** dancing to *Bang Bang*? Her face is very child-like so I was getting weirded out when she tried doing sexy/alluring moves and expressions. Anyway these girls had the best song to work with and it was great watching them have fun. **Somi** fits the *Bang Bang* energy more than pure songs like ITNW which makes her stand out really well as the center. I'm hoping that at the end of P101 Kahi takes **Chungha** under her wing because she is a phenomenal dancer and her stage presence is intense. My ranking went Chungha \u0026gt; Somi \u0026gt; Yoojung \u0026gt; Doyeon \u0026gt; Seokyoung \u0026gt; Dani \u0026gt; Eunbean with **Chungha** winning the overall dance ranking.","score":"14","subreddit":"kpop"}

{"body":"There is no proof (I am aware of) the standards were reduced in Ranger school. Speculation and claims. In any case, there are limits to what each sex is physically capable of achieving, I don't think that this goes over it. In order to determine whether it is feasible, we need to look at the specific requirements that are known and ask if there is a single woman who has achieved it. Then you combine the list and ask if it is possible for a woman to meet all the criteria. \n\nSo for instance. The advice that Stew Smith (Former SEAL) gives is:\n\nPHYSICAL SCREENING TEST \tMINIMUM \tOPTIMUM\n• Swim 500 yards \t             12:30 \t             9:00\n• Push-​​ups \t                          50 \t             90\n• Curl-​​ups a.k.a. Sit-​​ups \t             50 \t             85\n• Pull-​​ups \t                          10 \t             18\n• Run 1.5 miles \t                          10:30 \t             09:30\n\nSo. Now we have to look and determine if there are any women who can meet the optimum standard. Is there a single woman who can swim 500 yards? or do 90 pushups in the required time? We know there are women who swim competitively who can swim 500 yrds (I think haven't checked yet) Well according to the internet, Maria Tobar completed a world record 300 consecutive push-ups. (don't know the time, but even if not, we have to consider whether It is possible with sufficient training to get to a level where she could) So it is at least theoretically possible for a woman to do it. Go on down the list. So we look at the list and say \"Yes it looks like it is possible for a woman who focused on attaining these goals to be able to meet male standard for fitness as a SEAL candidate/graduate.\" You also have to look at the mental aspect, which is harder to quantify. I'm not going to make any attempt to logic that one.\n\nAccording to Stew:\n\n\u0026gt;I know there are women who can physically surpass those optimum standards above.\n\nBut in my mind what determines success in SoF training is mental and physical preparation.\n\nThe fact is that women have NOT been preparing to meet these standards. The women who went through the Ranger course didn't have a lifetime to prepare specifically for that purpose. They had a limited amount of time between when they were told they could attempt it, when they decided to attempt it and when they attended. I don't know how long it was.\n\nI think it is completely logical for a woman who decided in her teens that she wanted to be a Navy SEAL, and has that as an option to train until they meet those optimum standards mentioned above, perhaps to exceed them. To look at the suggested training regimens for SEAL and other candidates (because we know what kind of things have been taught in the past) and train to be able to withstand them.\n\nTell me what part of the training a woman cannot complete. What is it that is physically impossible for any woman to train to be able to conquer in 28 years.","score":"-7","subreddit":"news"}

Of course that happened to stop being true right when the Millennials started graduating, and now when Millennials say \"WTF you all said this was the best thing I could do with my life, but now I can't get a job and I have crushing debt\" the same people who told them they had to go to college or be poor forever now say \"it's your fault, obviously college wasn't a good idea, why would you ever go? Why did you pay so much? Didn't you think about the cost?\"\n\nI'll use myself as an example. I got into a cheap state school with a full ride, and a very expensive, prestigious top-ranked university. I asked my CFO Boomer dad if he could pay for it because I sure as hell couldn't. He said 'yes'. So I went to my top school, majored in a hard science, and busted my ass to have a hell of a CV and academic record when I came out of it. My reward was a $30k/year job...and all the loan debt. See, my dad, who despite promising to pay for my education and earning over $1 million/year, changed his mind and claimed he had never promised to pay. I guess I should have seen it coming though, after all he did quite literally fuck me as a kid too.\n\n\n\u0026gt;when you take out a loan for college, you read the terms of the loan, accepted the risk that you might not be able to pay it back, and signed the agreement, as an adult, as all adults do when they take out a loan.\n\nI wouldn't call someone who's been 18 for a few months, is still dependent on their parents and has to obey them under threat of punishment, and can still commute on a schoolbus an \"adult\", but then I suppose legally they are recognized as such. Though apparently while you're mature enough at that age to take out a $150,000 loan that can never be discharged even in bankruptcy, you're still 3 years away from being mature enough to drink alcohol, and 7 years away from being able to rent a car without being hit by a sky-high \"underage driver\" fee.","score":"20","subreddit":"news"}

Yet from 2003 through 2012, Pfizer funneled an amount equal to 71% of its profits into stock buybacks, and an amount equal to 75% of its profits into paying dividends to shareholders. In other words, it spent more on buybacks and dividends than it earned and tapped its capital reserves to help fund them.

A recent study seems to confirm these charges, finding that American universities and biotechnology firms are responsible for most innovative drug products.\n\n\"Biotechs and universities that partner initially with biotechs are responsible for the discovery of a disproportionately high number of innovative drugs,\" the study's author, Professor Robert Kneller, of the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo and Visiting Professor at Stanford Medical School, told DailyFinance. \"They are more likely to discover innovative drugs than established pharmas.\" \n\n[T]he big drug companies now concentrate mainly on the late-stage development of drugs they've licensed from other sources, as well as on producing variations of top-selling drugs already on the market -- called \"me-too\" drugs. There is very little innovative research in the modern pharmaceutical industry, despite its claims to the contrary.\"\n\n[Daily finance](http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/11/30/where-do-new-drugs-come-from-u-s-biotechs-lead-the-way/)\n\nThis year Pfizer will merge with Allergan, plc to form an Irish company, to cease paying American corporate taxes.

Data clearly shows that violent tendencies can be treated with rehabilitation. There are no known effective methods for rehabilitating deviant sexual impulses. \n\n\u0026gt; I think it's a statistical inevitability that these prisoners are becoming violent against each other.\n\nAnd I think you're fucking stupid to say that. There is no statistical inevitability. The entire point of statistical claims is to talk about what's likely. you're saying it's necessarily going to happen. You're no longer talking about statistics, at that rate. Furthermore, you're neglecting the actual prison structure. If I put a serial killer in an empty room, no matter how many people he murdered, there isn't ANY chance he will murder again. His proclivities are completely irrelevant. And that's EXACTLY the point of prison: controlled environment to protect people from those who harm others. Only problem is that in America, our prisons systems don't do that. We don't protect other people from the violent offenders. We offer them more victims willingly. That's outright an injustice, even if those victims are other violent criminals. They weren't sentenced to prison time + torture. So unless you care to openly espouse your support of torture as a method of retributive justice, then you're simply being dishonest. \n\n\u0026gt;If that's the case, you and I are of the same mind. I think prisoners who are violent should just be locked in solitary confinement forever. But US has issues with prison space, taxes, and ethical dilemmas surrounding putting people in solitary confinement forever.\n\nNo we don't. We have a problem with breeding violence within our prisons. THAT'S the largest contributing factor based on all the data. WE are doing this, not them.

I'm the one who fights against the notion that men and women are exactly the same (note: I mean culturally, not based on equal God-given rights that government exists to secure) because I think it's men's responsibility to protect women, which is why I think violence against women is so much more egregious and disgusting as compared to violence against other men. I'm the one who thinks that in the worst cases, men convicted of rape should be chemically castrated.\n\nI'm also surprised that a conservative like myself would be compared to Nazis, who were literally the National Socialist German Workers Party. I assume another connotation you would like to ascribe to conservatives is we are racist, like the Nazis. I find this funny, considering I'm the one arguing against a procedure that is done 40% by blacks. If I really wanted to suppress the minority representation of the population, I would be entirely for abortions. \n\nYou're also wrong about abortion being painless, although I guess that depends on whom you are referring to. Based on your blurb, it seems you don't really care about the child, but in case you were, the spinothalamic tract of the spinal cord that relays pain to the brain and the part of the brain responsible for processing it are formed between 20 and 25 weeks. There are also clear stress and hormonal responses by 20 weeks.\n\nNow, about abortion not being tragic. There's a reason even some Democrats came across the aisle and banned partial birth abortions, although Bernie supports it and I believe Hillary does as well. I think there's something inherently tragic in inducing a fully formed baby ready to breathe into the birth canal, sticking a pair of scissors into its skull, and sucking out its brain through a tube into a sink before delivering the essentially headless corpse.

At least where I live, there's no jobs, and the jobs that there are pay very little because they can replace anyone who isn't willing to work for peanuts.\n\n\"Find a job you like?\" I can't even find a job I *don't* like, half the time.\n\n\"Other people have it worse?\" Oh for fucks sale, really? Someone *always* has it worse. You're unemployed? Well some people can't even walk. Your mom died? Well there are people starving to death. Just because others have it worse, doesn't mean your problems aren't real.\n\nI was an adult for a while. I lived alone, in a nice apartment. I supported myself, even did some traveling. I was doing really well for myself.\n\nFor me, the problem was that my body stopped working properly and I had to give up a job I loved. I lost my apartment and moved back in with my mom. Basically a total regression, and boy does it suck.\n\nI sought treatment for the physical aspect and found out that my exhaustion and inability to cope and recover was at least partially (a form of) bipolar. Getting treated for that has made a huge difference, and I'm going back to school to get a degree, slowly building myself out of the hole I've been in for the past 3-4 years.\n\nIf it's an option for you, see a doctor and rule out any mental issues. They can be a real handicap in getting along. Then, remember that it's okay to take time for yourself. Don't give up, but don't kill yourself trying.\n\nWhat I know of adulthood is that really, no one knows what the fuck they're doing, or what they want. So don't feel like you're doing it wrong if you're lost and confused: a vast majority of people are.\n\nLastly, what's right for everyone might not be right for you. Different things make life worth living for different people. Working a job you don't care for might be fine because it gives you the money to go out with friends often. Or maybe at least your co-workers are nice. Or maybe you just really like feeling like you working that job contributes to society, and thus you are a worthwhile person. But those things might not be right for you. Only you can decide that.\n\nI could keep ranting, but I won't. Feel free to pm me if you need to talk.

{"body":"Apparently Waga's 'career' heavily hinges on donations, [just like servers, priests and beggars] (http://thehustle.co/get-rich-or-die-streaming-making-money-on-twitch-tv). The thing about donations is that they work only insofar as there is not too much competition, because otherwise you will lose potential donations to more skillful/entertaining streamers. So it's a bit naive to think that people like Waga \"open the way for more people to turn a hobby they love into a career apart from playing in a pro team\". It is naive in the sense that the more it works (more people in), the less it works (donations are split among streamers).\n\nAnother related point is this. It is not clear at all that Waga really helps people that want to turn streaming into a career because Waga his stream continuously benefits from his past career as a pro gamer. Indeed his stream is mostly a cost-efficient way of maintaining his dota level while showcasing himself for a potential contract as a pro player. New streamers with no such background don't have this chance, even though some a probably just as hard working/skillful/entertaining as him, if not more. Because of this starting advantage, it is possible that Waga is actually overshadowing more hard working /entertaining/skillful people that don't have his initial advantage.\n\nIn a nutshell, I am not saying that Waga should not get money from donations or that his stream or streaming in general is bad. I am just saying that it should be considered as it is: a relatively cheap (= not risky) way of making profit if you are an ex-pro player that wants to come back onto the competitive scene.","score":"-4","subreddit":"DotA2"}

{"body":"Edit: just want to point out I made some SERIOUS errors in this post. Don't post a mathy post at 5am in bed on your phone. /u/KevBurnsJr below has the correct numbers. \n\n\nDude with a math degree  here. Your calculation is a bit silly to be honest. Now you made it to 6k so far be it from me to tell you what high level players think about but do you really consider specifically what armour the buildings have or do you simply know that buildings have a lot of armour. And I'm not sure how you came up with your 666 extra parts for the stats section. Anyways the truth of the matter is you are greatly UNDERestimating the complexity.\n\n\nHow I would simply explain how complex it is to a layman is with four key numbers. 5 members on each team. 111 heros. And 6 item slots for each hero with 145 items.\n\n\nConsider a standard 2v2 lane. There are 111×110×109×108/2 possible lane match ups. (Dividing by two removes duplicate match ups). That is just shy of 72 MILLION possible lane match ups. \n\n\nNow consinder 145 items and 6 item slots. That gives us 145^6 possible builds for a dota hero. Now obviously most of those builds will not be viable such as 6 quelling blades. I think a more conservative guess would be to only take the 80 upgradeable and 2 roshan items and assume people only carry 1 type of each item. This is a large underestimation as it doesnt concern progression as one character might go through 20 different items in a game which can be considered a build. Anyways 6 slots and 82 different late game items gives us 82×81×80×79×78×77 = about 250 BILLION. Yes Billion with a B different builds. Recall this was an underestimate.\n\n\nAnd finally for the end game. 5 heros on each team.\nThere are 111×110×109×108×107×106×105×104×103×102/2 unique team compositions. Thats 1.87×10^20 different 5v5 team compositions. Oh and each team member has 2.5×10^11 different item builds.\n\n\nSo how many different end game situations are there? Well there are (number of hero combinations) x (number of item combinations) × (10 different heros)\n\n\nSo there are (1.87x10^20) × (2.5×10^11) x (10) = 4.68×10^32 different end game combinations. Thats 468000000000000000000000000000000.\n\n\nNow the question was how complex is dota? And the answer is much more complex than that big number. They use a similar method to calculate how complex Chess and Go are and those numbers are far larger than 4.68×10^30. I believe they hit numbers in the range of 10^80 for Chess and like 10^400 or something crazy for Go. Those numbers over estimate as they take in to consideration every legal possible move most of which would never be made in an actual game. The number I concocted too is probably and over estimation as most heros are actually \"limited\" to about 30 items that are considered viable on that hero. But what is important to remember is that Dota is a team game played by humans. 5 people on each side each acting on their own and obviously as a team (sometimes). That makes the idea of calculating the complexity basically meaningless because there are infinitely many possibilities and I have a degree in math so I use the term infinite literally.\n\n\nAnyways Id probably just stick to saying there are 72 million different lane match ups.","score":"43","subreddit":"DotA2"}

The rule is gone now, but it's worth bringing up that the Let's Play community has been aware of the possibly negative impact on sales from a Let's Play since they first became a thing.\n\nIt doesn't help that every game is so bloody different. I think it's fair to say that games like Ikaruga or Super Hexagon (the purely skill-centered games that focus the experience on developing a skillset) benefit from Let's Plays (or First Impressions in these cases) with extra sales, but story games don't. But it's really hard to define how a game would be affected past the obvious genres. Hell, I would have thought puzzle game sales don't benefit from Let's Plays at all, but looking back on my Steam catalog and I've probably bought more puzzle games after watching Let's Plays of them then any other genre.\n\nI mean, maybe this sort of thing could be prevented by allowing the developers to draw a line and say \"You need to wait three months after release before you show content past this point of the game\". But the general gaming public (Or Let's Play consumers in general) get really defensive at the idea of the game developer controlling anything about LP's of their games.\n\n...

The cooking channel on TV also sometimes helps with likes and dislikes.\n\nVillagers also have a set daily schedule, which can change with seasons, but for the most part you'll start to remember what they do every day.  Many people go to the saloon later in the evening, some people sit outside the main town area, others may sit near rivers/lakes, others could be hanging out with someone, etc.\n\nI generally refer to the wiki for things like crop values for each season - while this can be figured out without the wiki, it's much more convenient to use it.\n\nAbout 50 hours in now, I occasionally double check things on the wiki but for the most part I'm getting the hang of things, and I still haven't even completed the game yet.\n\nSo all in all, the game explains itself well, but not in a way where everything is given to you at once.

It's not that she could be considered hot, it's that the main focus of the pose is sexual. \n\nWhile they're not trying to make her some sort of sexless genderless creature,they don't think sex should be the main aspect of the pose.

If the guys ass was sticking out the same way her's was people would be talking about that too. \n\nDid you read the complaint? It's not about sex being involved. There are plenty of characters in the game that are extremely sexualized, but that's a part of those characters so it makes sense.

I've found that what really makes Burnout racing fun in previous games was Takedowns, ramming opponents, and the unpredictability. This formula doesn't really work in the open world of paradise for a few reasons. My main issue is the \"tracks\" of each race. There was pretty much only 15 or so finishing points dotted around the map, and once you got to know the optimal route to the end, it was easy to navigate yourself there no matter the starting point of the race. The open world also meant that, generally, opponents are much further apart on the map, and you had less opportunities for takedowns, and \"car combat\" than in the previous games. It just took out what I found fun about the races in Burnout 3 and revenge, and left a blandish shell of them.

This gives\na good speed improvement over the VS2008 version.\n\n- Asynchronous job search system. Instead of synchronously looking for a job,\nworkers, guards, prisoners, doctors now place a request for a new job in a\nqueue. This queue is processed during render phase of the game loop so\nshouldn't take up any time during the main game loop.\n\n- Speed up rendering of the Feed Prisoners Objective. This was particularly\nslow when their were a lot of hungry prisoners.\n\n- Rebuild the indoor/outdoor shadow mask only when a cell changes its material\nor indoor/outdoor status.\n\n**Thermodynamics (continued):**\n\n- New pipe type in the utilities view: Hot water pipes\nThese operate on a seperate layer to the existing pipes, and can be overlaid without conflict.\n\n- New utility: Hot water boiler\nRequires a large pipe connection of cold water, and a direct electrical connection\nYou can run hot water pipes from this boiler in any direction.\nNb. Water will lose heat the further it gets from the boiler.\n\n- All radiators now require a hot water connection to function\n\n- Showers can take cold water or hot water.\nWhen supplied with hot water, showers will also reduce a prisoner's Warmth need\nWhen supplied only with cold water will apply a Frigid effect, which acts as a kind of short-term surpression\nwhile also spiking their Warmth and comfort needs.\n\n**3D mode has been discovered:**\n\nThis update we have improved 3d mode with new shapes, new shaders operating on all objects, and better wall geometry.\n3d mode remains very experimental.\n\nKnown bug: The mouse position is wrong when using graphics/Supersampling.\nKnown bug: Long pauses caused by geometry changing, eg wall construction/demolition\n\n**Bug fixes:**\n\n- Thermodynamic map to use 16 bit number type to represent the temperature\ninstead of 8 bit.

{"body":"I like a lot of things the game does a lot, but after 20 or so hours I just couldn't continue and it's almost solely the fault of the world layout. Well to be fair, a combination of the world layout and the complete lack of a map or any sort indicator of where you are or where your objective is. A vast majority of the overworld looks the same as it takes place in a massive underground rail system. To give you an idea what that might be like, [here's a user created map of just one section of overworld](http://www.underrail.com/wiki/images/c/c5/Map-lu.png). Now imagine each of those boxes are a typical CRPG map, that each square is laid out like a diamond so Northwest is actually North (Southeast is South), and that most of them have no real value or anything unique to them (basically filler from getting to point A to point B). All of that on top of no in game map or navigation just leads to a frustration and soul draining trudge trying to find your destination. Basically all you get is a NPC at the starting location saying \"It's to the West.\" \n\nSome people are ok with this, or even prefer it. If you can get over that part then it's definitely a solid CRPG and worth your time if you enjoy the genre, since there are so few CRPGs  (let alone decent ones) these days. \n\nEdit: SirRagesAlot brought up something I forgot. I'm pretty experienced in how CRPGs work, and can competently build a solid character. However even going in with that experience I ran into some extreme difficulty spikes, some of which made me reload over a dozen times and depend completely on RNG. One section (I believe it was called junkyard) I had to reload so often that I figured out the perfect engagement spot and still had to rely on \"targets missing X amount of times and me hitting/critting X amount of times or else it was over\". I do not recommend going into the game completely blind build wise unless you plan on playing on a lower difficulty or enjoy constant reloading as some builds just straight out under preform despite them being solid on paper and RNG will just wreck you over and over.","score":"98","subreddit":"Games"}

{"body":"edit: added links, corrected typos\n\n(long) Story Time!!  It's long, so TL;DR is that I looked at a red nsx, passed after an inspection.  The mechanic who did the inspection persuaded one of his clients to sell his black NSX in the OP which worked out perfectly because he was looking for an AWD 911 to tool around tahoe in, so we worked out an exchange.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nTo give some background - this photo was from back when I had my 1991 Sebring Silver NSX (some of you may remember this post: http://i.imgur.com/tt0IbEl.jpg), and I had just dropped it off to Jim Russell the NSX guru’s shop in Redwood City CA. As I walked out of his shop, this black beauty caught my eye - I stopped to admire it, snapped this shot, and went about my business.  My sebring '91 was having a lot of issues as it wasn't well cared for - and I recall thinking to myself \"wow, I hope one day my NSX will be as nice as this one.\"  Anyhow, fast forward about 10 months from then and I’ve sadly put my silver NSX for sale - something I’d end up regretting quite a bit.\n\nIn the past few months, the seller's remorse was really strong (I had been regretful ever since selling it in early 2015 but it's just been growing stronger since).  I’ve been hunting for a stock NSX, not necessarily low-miled - but a well maintained one with all service records, inspected and approved by an NSX guru before purchasing. A red comptech supercharged one in sacramento caught my eye - even though I didn’t care for the supercharger at first, *ALL* service records were immaculately presented, which made me think it might be a good idea to consider. And all the work had been done by Shad @ Driving Ambition (formerly from Comptech), who is *the* guy to have your NSX worked on here in northern california.  The car in question is this one: http://imgur.com/vyVDM1T.jpg\n\nI went up there three weekends or so ago to test drive it myself. Fell in love with how it pulled and whined, and it rode exceptionally well. It pulled *hard* like a corvette, felt connected and telepathic like an elise, balanced and planted like a boxster/cayman, all while ergonomically perfect with that cockpit view of the NSX. I was smitten.  I figure it’s a done deal, but just to be safe, I requested Jim Russell’s services for an inspection, and he agreed to meet me up there in sacramento the week after to do as thorough an inspection as he is able (what a guy!). I bribe him with money and promises of steak dinners.\n\nAnyhow, Jim Russell is *incredibly* thorough. He found a myriad of issues from some work that was done at an audio/stereo shop - missing trim pieces, badly done stereo wiring pushed through a hacked firewall grommet letting water into the car, cracked door trim on the passenger side, holes drilled in the headlamp covers where a former HID kit used to sit, a binding/clicking passenger seat at the top of its adjustment travel, to name a few. They had the car listed for $75k, and I bargained them down to $66k and got them to give me an extra $5k on my trade, so I thought I was doing great. But after adding up all the fixes I was going to do after Jim’s discoveries, it was a pretty terrible deal for me. It was a real shame, because the performance work done on this car by Shad @ DA was *impeccably* done, and Jim Russell gave a big thumbs up on a well done, proper install for all the performance modifications. And it drove like a beast, Jim kept talking about how hard it pulled afterwards with a big smile on his face, haha. But I just couldn't get past the shoddy audio/stereo work (done at some weird outside audio shop, not DA). And of course, there was those ugly tweeter warts that the p/o installed by drilling through $2k/each door panels. I had already decided to pass on the car, when Jim mentioned this car only passed smog because sacramento county runs an “unenhanced” smog test - just a visual and sniffer - he was pretty sure that this car would fail the dyno sniffer in the “enhanced” smog tests of my area, and that’s *if* the tech skimps on the visual and doesn’t catch the non carb-legal fuel pressure regulator and oversized fuel injectors.\n\nAnyways, later that night I give him a call to tell him thanks, and to schedule a steak dinner for his services. I mentioned to him I passed on the car, and he replies with a “yeah, I’m glad you didn’t buy that car. It would have cost you a lot of money and time.  Given you a lot of grief.  By the way, want a stock black one? 1996 nsx-t? I’m not sure if he’ll sell or not, but I can ask.” I jump at the chance, of course.\n\nTurns out, it’s the black one I saw in front of his shop 2 years ago.  It all clicked when Jim mentioned that the owner is a retired/former lockheed martin rocket scientist.  Ah!  RKT SCNC.  Jim reaches out to the owner to ask if he wants to sell, and is immediately answered with a “nope.” But Jim vouches for me, letting him know I’m not one of those kids who would put giant wings, goofy body kits, neon lights, spinning wheels,etc on the car. He hems and haws a bit and is reluctant. That’s when Jim mentions that I’m looking to sell my Carrera 4S (here: http://imgur.com/C2K1DYl.jpg), and owner lit up. He had been thinking about getting an AWD car to take to his numerous tahoe trips that is still “fun” and sporty, and has been curious about 911s for a while. Bonus is that the C4S is ready to accept a luggage/bike rack (he is an avid cyclist). \n\nJim completely vouches for this black NSX as one of the most pristine he’s ever seen, and seeing how OCD and thorough he was with the red NSX’es inspection, that meant a lot. His exact words were “This car is a *stud*. Needs nothing. Owner is completely anal, didn’t even drive it in the rain. I’m the only one who’s worked on the car since ’99 or ’00 and he never drives the thing.” I am sold.\n\nSo, the next Sunday night, Jim connected the two of us. I gave the owner a call, and we just hit it off. Chatted about what we were looking for, asked and answered questions about our respective cars. The next day, I drove over to his place in half moon bay and we inspected each others cars and test drove them. (his soon-to-be-mine NSX: http://imgur.com/PVEVJOe.jpg - this is the first time I'm seeing it again since the 2014 photo in the OP) He immediately scheduled an inspection on my C4S for the next wednesday morning, and with Jim Russell’s endorsement I was ready to buy the black NSX as-is without inspection. BTW, I had a glorious drive home on 84/skyiline back from HMB in the C4S, it was a pretty fantastic parting-ways drive that made me a bit emotional.\n\nThe C4S passed its PPI with flying colors (dealer’s words were “one of the cleanest C4S’es we’ve seen in a while”), outside of finding a torn CV boot on the front left - which I subtracted from the cost of the car to cover for the new buyer. After a bunch of paperwork and cashiers checks, here we are! Mission Accomplished. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience. I am still stunned at how quickly and smoothly this all went down, and I feel the positive experience makes the car even more special - I didn’t just walk into a dealer and walk out with a car like I have in the past. I made a connection with another enthusiast, and worked with him to make a deal happen that we were both very happy about.  It's been a couple weeks since the deal now, and we still keep in touch and keep tabs on each other to make sure we are enjoying our respective new cars.  Actually, the hardest part of it all was driving the NSX away after signing the title.  The previous owner stood in the driveway and watched me pull away (in the rain, no less, which it had never seen in his stewardship).  I could feel his heart breaking, and it was hard to balance that with the joy I felt at taking my new-to-me NSX home.  I wouldn't be surprised if he cried - some jerk had just come and taken away his pride and joy of 16+ years.\n\nI swap cars often, but I will die with this car. Whether it’s a month from now or 30 years from now, I make no promises. But man, I’m afraid to drive it now as it is completely accident or even blemish free (the paint still looks like you can reach right through it), and pretty much pristine - it’s going to get harder and harder to find another NSX in this condition.\n\nTruly, “an eternal sportsmind for me.” Here she is at home in her new garage - sorry for pic quality, it was dark and rainy: http://imgur.com/boOLZle.jpg\n\nand some more photos I've taken since ownership of the car: http://imgur.com/a/ywj34\n\nmy only plans now are to get rid of the chrome-y polished wheels for some brushed/satin OEM wheels of the same style. :)  And I lied - the car wasn't 100% stock, the p/o had comptech headers installed (along with zanardi rear sway bars) but kept the stock muffler (i know, weird right).  I got a comptech exhaust on it and I'm pretty happy with the sound.","score":"17","subreddit":"Honda"}

{"body":"Miami is facing a condo bust—again.\n\nDevelopers have started canceling projects, slashing prices and offering incentives such as private-jet access to spur sales, an ominous echo of the housing crash that pounded South Florida especially hard.\n\nEasy financing and rising prices prompted developers to build about 21,000 condos in the downtown Miami area from 2004 to 2008. Many of those units sat empty for years.\n\nDevelopers say this time they have insulated themselves by requiring buyers to put down 50% deposits by the time buildings break ground and by canceling projects instead of moving forward as the market slows.\n\nStill, it may not be easy for some to sidestep the damage. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the number of Miami Beach condo transactions declined nearly 20% from a year earlier, while inventory jumped by nearly a third, according to a report from appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc. The median sales price slipped 6.6%, according to the report.\n\n“The condo market has peaked,” said Neisen Kasdin, a real-estate development lawyer at Akerman LLP in Miami. “Sales velocity has slowed down considerably.”\n\n‘The condo market has peaked. Sales velocity has slowed down considerably.’\n—Neisen Kasdin\nMany of the forces buffeting the Miami market are also hitting luxury markets in New York, Southern California, Australia and London. A strong U.S. dollar and weakening local currencies, dropping oil prices and global economic turbulence have crimped the buying power of foreign investors.\n\nAt the same time, stock-market turbulence has made wealthy locals hesitant to undertake big purchases. Luxury-home prices in 10 global cities analyzed by broker Knight Frank LLP are expected to increase by 1.7% this year, down from 3% growth in 2015.\n\nCarlos Rosso, president of condominium development at Related Group, Miami’s largest condo developer, said he sells about 20 units a week in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, versus about 100 a week last year. In response, the company priced its new Auberge development, a 60-story project in downtown Miami, at $600 a square foot, compared with the $850 a square foot it might have asked a couple of years ago.\n\nTHE PROPERTY REPORT\n\nForeclosure Firms Reinvent Themselves for Better Times\nIf Related and its partners hadn’t decided to lower prices, they probably would have had to wait until the next cycle to start construction, Mr. Rosso said. The project launched two months ago and Related has sold about 70 units out of 350 so far.\n\n“It’s a marathon and it’s not a 100-meter chase,” he said. “This is the part of the marathon where we are running a little bit slower.”\n\nOther Miami developers have put on hold or canceled more than half a dozen projects planned earlier in the cycle, from the Ion East Edgewater, a 35-story tower planned by a local Florida development firm, to Krystal Tower, a downtown tower planned by a Brazilian developer, according to consulting firm Integra Realty Resources Miami. Overall, the pipeline of units in active projects in Miami has shriveled by 42%, according to a report released a month ago by Integra.\n\nAt the Aurora, a new 61-unit building off the Miami waterfront, the developer is offering buyers a free membership to JetSmarter, a service that allows members to use shared private jets for free.\n\nTim Lobanov, managing director of Verzasca Group, which is developing the building, said the perk has a retail value of about $12,000 and is part of the project’s pitch to appeal to New Yorkers. JetSmarter offers flights several times a week from New York to southern Florida.\n\nThe south Florida condo market is especially vulnerable to swings in the global economy because developers rely heavily on foreign buying, particularly South Americans, Russians, Europeans and Canadians.\n\nForeign investors have pulled back as the value of their currencies has dropped versus the dollar. Brazilians, for example, have seen the value of their currency against the dollar slip nearly 42% since 2014, while Argentines have seen their purchasing power in the U.S. decline more than 40%, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\nMiami developers said they are seeing increased demand from New Yorkers and Chinese buyers looking to buy second homes, but that is unlikely to replace the sharp drop in demand from South Americans.\n\n“The depth of the Chinese market, or the European or Canadian market, is not enough to make up for the South American buyer,” said Anthony Graziano, senior managing director at Integra.\n\nConstruction in downtown Miami in November. As the condo market slows, developers are canceling projects and requiring bigger deposits when buildings break ground.\nConstruction in downtown Miami in November. As the condo market slows, developers are canceling projects and requiring bigger deposits when buildings break ground. PHOTO: JOE SKIPPER/REUTERS\n‘I don’t see this as the bloodbath that we had last go around at all.’\n—Gil Dezer\nWhile people across the industry acknowledge the market is slowing, they say low debt levels and a slowdown in new projects will prevent the massive oversupply they saw during the last bust.\n\n“I don’t see this as the bloodbath that we had last go around at all,” said Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development, builder of high-end Miami condos such as the Residences by Armani Casa, which has seen sales volume plunge to six a month from 20.\n\nOverall, about 1,200 condo units in Miami were delivered last year, down from the peak of 10,000 units in 2008, according to Integra. But with more than 7,300 units under construction, inventory is expected to increase.\n\nMost Miami developers have protected themselves by taking a page from the South American markets. Many now require buyers to pay a 50% deposit on the total cost of their units by the time the project breaks ground. Developers don’t break ground until the project is 80% sold, which means the deposits are enough to cover a significant portion of the construction costs. During the last cycle, by contrast, developers required only 20% deposits and allowed buyers to flip their units while they were still in contract.\n\nRelated and a few other developers have since loosened their deposit requirements to 30% from 50% to spur more deals. Mr. Rosso said Related does that only when it already has secured a construction loan and doesn’t need the additional deposits to cover building costs because the building is 80% sold.\n\nStill, Mr. Rosso said the company doesn’t anticipate breaking ground on many new projects in Miami in the next couple of years and instead will be focusing on projects in places like Argentina and Mexico.\n\n“A big part of the cycle is understanding when it’s time to launch new jobs and when it’s time to sell what you have,” he said.\n\nWrite to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com","score":"66","subreddit":"Miami"}

{"body":"Power creep is the idea that as a game gets older, the average power level of elements within that game will increase.\n\nSimply put, companies need to release new content to keep their game fresh, but there needs to be further incentive for that new content to be purchased. Thus, power creep. Essentially, companies make their newer game additions stronger or generally more overloaded than previous additions. This will cause these newer additions to be stronger than their predecessors, and thus their predecessors will become obsolete over time. \n\nI'm a League player so I'll use a League example. Anivia is an example champion in that game who has fallen victim to power creep. As one of the original 40 champions, Anivia's kit was considered 'op' because she had high burst damage, an Isis Stun Ball, a Ymir wall, and constant slows. She could control zones incredibly well. However, until recently (where she has been buffed directly and by item changes and stuff), Anivia has been considered a poor pick (for about two-three seasons), because newer champions with better kits have come along and made her look bad in comparison (she's immobile and has huge mana issues). \n\nLook at the list of ADC's posted above, aside from Neith, all of those ADC's listed are relatively new gods. This is an example of power creep. Their kits are just stronger than older ADC's. \n\nEdit: I should continue, because I should explain what it means in this context. Basically, how a company deals with power creep differs. Riot's response is usually to nerf everything (thus the idea of a weakness creep instead). In this instance, rather than nerf the over-performing gods, Hi-Rez has chosen to buff the under-performing ones closer to the level of the over-performing ones, thus making everybody stronger unnecessarily rather than just nerfing the outliers. \n\nThis creates problems. For one thing, it's easier to predict the consequences of a nerf than a buff. Nerfs can be partially reverted, whereas buffing a champion that hasn't been touched in a long time can have unintended consequences. Furthermore, you further the power creep. You create distance between the now-buffed champions and the still unbuffed ones, meaning those left behind are now even worse in comparison. Moreover, when it comes to new content, it forces the developer to think of something even more op than the current power in the game. ","score":"20","subreddit":"Smite"}

Portugalin eläkeläiset käytännössä maksattavat terveydenhoitopalvelut suomalaisilla veronmaksajilla, mutta eivät enää itse osallistu näitten verojen maksamiseen.\n\nMinulla ei olisi mitään Espanjan eläkeläisiä vastaan, mikäli he nauttisivat pelkkää reilusti ansaitsemaansa eläkettä ja maksaisivat KAIKKI muut palvelut portugalissa omasta pussistaan. Jos KELA korvaa heidän terveydenhoitokulunsa, niin on aivan kohtuullista, että heitä myös verotetaan terveydenhoitopalveluitten käytöstä.","score":"39","subreddit":"Suomi"}

It was also by sheer luck that she got a role in the end, yet it was much more impacting. The scene where Zuka signals Miyamori not to introduce her to the directors at the diner, was impactful. Another character I liked was Hiraoka, as his character acted as a foil to Miyamori's. I wished they went more into his backstory because unlike Miyamori, who has had good workplace setting since starting her career, Hiraoka showed more of the negatives, complications with the industry.

Jay Garrick. \n\nI'm truly sorry, but I don't like that we as a community are being generalized. \n\nI really wish there was peace amongst the fanbase.\n\nThe vibe I get from the Arrow subreddit is:\n\n\"Honour the source material ffs! It doesn't matter if it's an alternate story, they should make it exactly or somewhat like the comics. Also fuck Olicity!\"\n\nand the vibe I get from Twitter/Tumblr/Facebook is:\n\n\"Olicity is amazing, they're perfect. Oliver needs Felicity to be Green Arrow. We should campaign to get Olicity back in the Green Arrow comics. Oh wait? It didn't do good the first time? Who cares, fuck what the comic book fans want. Also, Olicity is endgame, it doesn't have to follow the comics in the show. Dinah Laurel Lance hasn't existed for 5 years. #Olicity4ever\"\n\nOne of the reasons I so openly oppose Olicity is because Green Arrow is my favourite superheroes, and I don't want him to be ruined or changed so drastically. I've tried accepting Olicity and said multiple times on other social networks, that I'm fine with it unless it comes to the comics. \n\nI really want to like Olicity, and to be honest, (it's deleted now but) I used to have an image posted on imgur of an Olicity gif (you know the one in the...elevator? was it? or whatever, where he tells her to hold on) and I titled it something like \"Olicity cute moment\", this was before I came to this sub.\n\nWhen I came to this sub, I started to realize the flaws in the show. It wasn't the subs fault that I dislike Olicity, it's the fact that I never bothered to have a problem with it in the first place. I never shipped it, but I always tolerated it. \n\nOnce I hear other people's opinions, I start to think differently. That's why I'm down for them to keep Olicity in the show, and keep it out of the comics, because it favors both comic book fans and Olicity fans. \n\nWhen I hear opinions online or wherever about certain things, I try to see why people feel that way and make a decision in my head. \n\nFor example: the Green Lantern or Daredevil movie. I liked them, most people didn't. It was only recently that I realized the big flaw in the GL movie. I still like it, but I openly recognize the flaw and accept other people's opinions.\n\nWith Olicity, I've started to realize the toll it's taken on Felicity's character and the massive screentime it's gotten lately.

It's a joke on how oblivious he is, that he thinks she's stupid for being sad about it.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; I didn't make Laurel look like a dumb person.

There wasn't a nice comment towards Lance, Oliver, or Malcolm, because there was nothing nice to say. I'm not going to artificially create compliments to praise a character if they haven't done anything to earn it. I'm not an *Arrow* writer.  Speaking of which, you don't seem upset with my treatment of Malcolm. I've always shit on how stupid it is that he's still alive and how illogical his character is, and his two appearances in my synopsis this time around is a stupid lie, and a panel that literally just says \"i suck\". Why doesn't that bother you?\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; The women in my synopses get called names because (some of) the women *are* written much worse.

Oliver was an [idiot](http://imgur.com/O3ZnkBr) in this episode, and so I [called him out on it](http://imgur.com/RBvZ2BQ). And I've done it before too, be it making fun of his fighting prowess, or taking all of Felicity's money, or his stubborn refusal to kill even when it's the right thing to do. I did not make fun of Vixen. I didn't make fun of Samantha. I rarely make fun of Thea. I don't make fun of Sara. I never make fun of Lyla when she appears. I don't make fun of Caitlin, I never made fun of Patty (you should appreciate that, I think) and I stopped making fun of Iris since her character turned around. I don't make too much fun of Laurel either (unless she's being an idiot, like the episode when Sara came back), I make fun of the writers that give her absolutely nothing to do, every single episode.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; The only person that I really consistently shit on is Felicity. This is not a sexism thing. This is a shitty character in the show that I am going to make fun of because making fun of shitty characters is funny, and being funny is the only thing I care about with these synopses.  Now I agree, somtimes the sub goes too far. The other day when literally every single post was about Felicity? That's no good. The trial moderator rules are a good idea. BUT that doesn't mean I'm going to just start praising her or excluding her from being made fun of when she does something stupid, which, I'm sorry, but she often does. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; tl;dr- I truly do apologize that my synopses are too mean-spirited for your tastes, but I'm not going to change them until the characters I'm making fun of change too.","score":"21","subreddit":"arrow"}

Email account creation now requires a phone number for an activation code.  So for the person who has no cell phone and has to come to the library to use the internet, if they want to create an email account they also have to borrow our phones to receive their activation code. They then continue to sit and ask for help on how to fill out a form for a job where they will NEVER have to touch a computer again. These are the kinds of hurdles people are facing on the other side of digital.

{"body":"What's the plural form of Canada or France?\n\nThere is none because they're proper nouns just like Midas is a proper noun that is a name of a king of eld.\n\nEdit for my own pedantry. The reason plurals of proper nouns do not exist is that proper nouns typically refer to a unique object. Since it is unique there cannot be multiples of it. The proper plural format for Midas would be \"Floors of Midas\" as Midas is the left arm of the Alexander construct while Gordias was the right arm. However there exists some cases in our world where there is a proper noun where it can be used in a plural context to reference two unique objects but in many cases the plural format is achieved because we intentionally ignore an adjective that is combined with the noun to create the proper noun that references the unique object. In these cases you use the standard method of pluralize which is -s or -es. Such examples would include Koreas (North and South Korea), Americas (North, Central, and South America), or Vietnams (North and South Vietnam) or in the case of family members where you refer to them by the collective last name such as the Olsens, Clintons, or Bushes.\n\nEdit for pedantry with an answer to question\n\nAfter considering my previous edit I realized we are actually running the Floors of Midas. Midan is the adjective form of Midas thus we are running the Midan Floors of Alexander. The most appropriate plural format could thus be \"Midans\".","score":"16","subreddit":"ffxiv"}

{"body":"Me too. Masturbating to naked photos of exes is totally different than porn because you had actual, real-life loving relationships with those people, so when you're masturbating it's not just fantasy it's like reliving those same feelings and intimacy and the love and life shared together, which makes it so much more personal and offensive if you have a current partner. And there's so much anonymous naked sexiness out there even if you object to sex trafficking and what not you can still find plenty of naked tits/ass whatever. So it would suggest more of a desire for that previous intimacy/relationship as the appeal than just as sexual stimulation, which would be the concerning part to me. Also, as the partner I'd be concerned for the privacy of the exes and the fact that those private photos had been kept despite the relationships ending. And as the ex I'd be super pissed about it.

No. But it will stop the rust from getting out of hand. And for what it's worth, an improperly done Bondo job will make things worse.

This is nearly identical to what drives folks in their desperate neighborhoods to join gangs in the U.S.  It happens everyday here in Los Angeles amongst the Latino and African-American communities that are, at once, marginalized and, yet, at the same time, victims of their own devices.  \n\nWe are all desperate for meaning and identity.  According to Carl Jung, outside of a fear of death our second greatest fear is lack of orientation.  Many are also lazy, ignorant or naive and want a quick fix to life's most pressing questions, especially in the face of discrimination and despair.  ","score":"16","subreddit":"islam"}

{"body":"Most of the time, the top end commercial variant of software *is* open source. RHEL is used on every single Fortune 500 bank server; it's used by 90% of Fortune 500 companies. Linux is the leading server OS. Apache is the leading httpd; the second most used, Nginx, is also open source. Android is the most popular mobile OS, and Java has been open source for ten years. The only areas where open source doesn't win out is the desktop. But that's because at the time when Linux was on version 0.1, Windows had already been a commercial product with a usable graphical environment for ten years.\n\nThese companies support open source because it suits them to do it. It's part of their business model. The majority of work on open source is done by developers at a few companies who run open source software and sell products and services to other companies (and sometimes end users). [Take the kernel as an example](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2015/02/linux-foundation-releases-linux-development-report):\n\n\u0026gt;The number of paid developers is on the rise, as companies aggressively recruit top Linux talent. More than 80 percent of kernel development is done by developers who are being paid for their work. Volunteer developers tend not to stay that way for long.\n\nThe main development tools we're using are funded by companies selling support and services for those tools: aside from the kernel, you have [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/contributors/) made up largely of people from companies working on a product their company uses (and that's just the httpd), or [Docker](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2925484/application-virtualization/look-whos-helping-build-docker-besides-docker-itself.html), where the number of Red Hat developers working on Docker exceeds the number of Docker developers working on Docker.\n\nIf you're using Linux to get away from the corporate world, you're out of luck. Even if you follow some very strict GNU requirements for using FOSS, the kernels you use have more corporate input than volunteers. The major distributions are corporate backed; even the community editions of Ubuntu aren't really that at all. The Linux community is overwhelmingly companies and people who work for them, so they are making things better for themselves.\n\nMe, I use Linux because it's infinitely more interesting than Windows, and the parts of it are more accessible. It does the job I want in the best way. In the past I've used Windows primarily, because that's done the job I needed to do then. And if, in the future, I happen to stumble into work that primarily uses Windows tools, I'll probably start using Windows more.","score":"15","subreddit":"linux"}

Acknowledge that it's a trend and that not every woman is like that, but many are. In general, I do think that women are looking for a guide and/or leader when it comes to sexual attraction. There's certainly an element of wanting an equal partner, but I think that's tied into what they want out of life. It's definitely separate and tough to balance.

That's a lot of time to test ideas and scrap ones that don't work until a good formula is established, and once you've got that formula why not use it again?\n\nThe slightly more satisfying answer is that HR shows the peak of human indulgence in the DX timeline. This is where the conspiracy has only just started to decay things, and most people are still on the up and up. The original DX is clearly a world in decline, and I believe with MD they're looking to start this downward spiral. Ideally we will see some of that transition between the techno-renaissance of HR, and the more Gibsonian dystopia of DX.\n\nAlso world design is extremely time consuming, because you can get a bunch of work done before realising it's no good and having to start over. It's a bit of a false dichotomy because you'd assume there's different staff on different tasks, but if I had to pick fresh world design or better writing I'd pick the latter every time.","score":"16","subreddit":"Deusex"}

{"body":"Me and Em had the same upbringing. A mother on drugs. A dad who wasn't there. She lost custody of me at 8 and I was put into a group home wth all black kids . At age 11 the slim shady LP came out and while I was enjoying rap at the time ( kinda forced onto me lol but loved it ) I couldn't relate. My roommate had a copy of the slim shady LP and offered to put it on at bed time. \n\nI cried man. It was my first real album I heard that told a story. The word play. Man. I was young but I got a lot of it. It made me laugh and cry and made me want more.

My friends think I'm gay for the guy but fuck that I'm just truly thankful for someone who gave me inspiration. \n\nWhen lose yourself came out, I was getting bullied in high school.

I listened to lose yourself right before pulling the trigger and buying my one way plane ticket to Los Angeles. Thank you Em and the fans as well because it always cool to meet someone who gets it.

It was far easier for me to learn by my ear and what made sense by sound than trying to understand theory. I learned most of what I know from just watching YouTube videos of all my favorite players (EVH, Reb Beach, Steve Vai, Satch, BB King, Buddy Guy, etc.) and just trying to replicate or do what they did, but in my own style. Even when I learn songs now, I try to learn them in my own way (even if looking at tabs) rather than trying to be identical to the song itself. \n\nEdit: I kinda figured I'd end up getting downvoted to oblivion because hey it's reddit.

{"body":"Wellp I just started reading about this drama today, but these are the things I learned from watching Athene and Ali debate:\n\nA core complaint is this:  Ali the CEO of Vulcan claims Athene is slandering Twitch Alerts in his youtube video for saying that Twitch Alerts/Vulcan never properly informed Athene (and other streamers) about their new policy in charging fees of 1% of donations.\n\nThe CEO of Vulcan in this debate replies that he did in fact inform people of the fees of charging 1% of donations... and says the information was communicated through **3 TWITTER posts** and a **BLOG** post...\n\n[I'm not even making this up.](https://www.twitch.tv/athenelive/v/57621831) At 30 minutes 25 seconds mark, the CEO of Vulcan and Athene discuss the events which started this drama.  And then details his \"attempts of communication of fees\" at 32 minutes.\n\nTwitter and Blog posts... that's **extremely unprofessional.**  I don't have a Twitter, and even if I did, I certainly wouldn't follow the tweets or blog posts of say my bank, or twitch alerts for this matter.\n\nNot an Athene fan here, nor too versed in all this drama.... but I'd say the CEO of Vulcan seems to has his head shoved really far up his ass.  What he did pertaining to charging a 1% fee might be legal, since apparently the terms of services allows him to charge whatever he wants whenever he wants... but it was certainly unprofessional.  I would say Athene certainly also has a legal right to make a video criticizing the events which unfolded from his perspective- and it seems valid to criticize and say such fees were conducted without notification simply because the word \"notification\" suggests the act of \"proper notification\".  In fact, Athene could simply edit his video and use textboxes to write \"proper notification\" \"proper communication\" whenever he uses the word notification and communication, and hence it wouldn't be infactual anymore.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nOther hilarious things I learned:  CEO of Vulcan personally writing \"this is a huge viewbot scam\" in Athene chat, yet he personally suspended and apologized for one of his employees for writing similar anecdotes in Athene's chat for engaging in slander.\n\nAlso the \"spam and harassment\" the CEO of Vulcan is referencing to is that people are donating and advertising G4G (a competing donation platform started by Athene) in their donations.  This is not harassment or spam.\n\n[And at 48 minutes](https://www.twitch.tv/athenelive/v/57621831) the CEO of Vulcan is making threats.  ON STREAM!  Hilarious.\n\n[Here's a link of more things the CEO of Vulcan writes on Twitch Chat.](http://overrustlelogs.net/Destiny%20chatlog/March%202016/userlogs/mojopowerz)  Although in their debate, the CEO of Vulcan mentions that he realizes Athene is not behind the viewbotting.\n\nAnyway needless to say, if you are a streamer, it seems you should give G4G a try.

I really enjoyed Euron as well as the later stages when Victarion and Moqorro interact as they approach Slaver's Bay.\n\nI *loved* Tyrion's journey, From the point he got into Illyrio's palanquin, all the way through the trip down the river Rhoyne, till he hit Volantis. Still one of my favorite parts of the book period. I loved reading his ride down the road with Illyrio and his trip down the river with the Gryffs, Septa Lemore, ect.\n\nI also loved the Battle of Blackwater Bay in the books. It was the first time in the books that the chapters bounced between PoV's in only one location (Tyrion, Sansa, Cersei) and I ended up reading it straight through, it was 10x better than the show. Really surprised.\n\nLast but not least, Ser Barristan the Bold blew my mind. His PoV chapters were so cool to read, especially when he fought Khrazz. I love to be inside the mind of an exemplary knight, and I love watching him train the \"lads\" or squires in training. Strong Belwas is also fucking awesome. I am so mad he got cut from the show, and I will never forgive HBO for killing off Ser Barristan without presenting him fully as the gangster that he is.\n\nHonorable mention for the Battle for Castle Black, although I did love the giant scythe they dropped down the wall in the show, that was really cool lol.","score":"36","subreddit":"asoiaf"}

I originally planned to write a series of posts about it, but the problem is that it's all tinfoil.  It comes from my own interpretation of the story filtered through secondary sources like The Golden Bough and Eastern traditions.  I believe individual interpretations of fiction are valid, but most of the ASOIAF fan base doesn't.  \n\nThere's not much direct textual support for any of this stuff, and GRRM may not have intended guest right to have any sort of supernatural connotations - he might have just wanted to have a formal tradition in his world for welcoming guests and ensuring their safety.  Jaime sitting that way on the Iron Throne could have been something he wrote without any thought behind it at all.  I reread the books last year specifically looking for evidence for this and there's nothing there that isn't subject to confirmation bias on my part.\n\nWhat would happen is I'd spend days of my life writing this up and all the anti-tinfoil contingent of the fandom has to do to bury it is say \"this is not in the books\" and \"GRRM hates fan fiction.\"  So, I just drop hints about it here and there and hope that someone with more time and motivation than me comes along to flesh it out.

As an asoiaf fan you can probably imagine this fairly easily. Jordans last books spent too much time showing us everything with everyone, and as a result no one got to *do* very much. But in all fairness, the last 3 books (12 -14) that Brandon Sanderson wrote with extensive use of Jordan's notes, do a very good job at undoing those issues in a very effective manner while still, imo, staying pretty true to the spirit of the books/characters/world the jordan poured his heart in to.

Take your pick. \nWhat I meant was that I won't be dismissing symptoms of what might be a whooping cough like \"just another cold and he'll get over it\". I'll take symptoms seriously an get him checked by a doctor and if I don't glhave a good feeling about his diagnose, even to a hospital if needed.\n\nI never heard of FAERS before you mentioned it. Since the CDC will cover a lot more cases than the institutions overhere I will definitly read up on it. Thank you. \n\nLastly. And this goes for everyone reading this, especially the downvoters:\nI don't know if you're a parent yourself or not. However like any other parent I want to do what's best for my kid. The decissions I make I don't make lightly and are hard as fuck. \nI've asked myself these 2 questions hundreds of times:\n\"What if I vaccinate and he does gets complications? What if it kills him?\" \nAnd\n\"What if I don't, and it kills him?\"\nFor the answer you can cut out all the bullshit about percentages and chances. I don't want to hurt or kill my kid, I love him more than anything and if I make the wrong choice he may die because of it. Before I was a parent the choice was easy and I would tell you to \"just vaccinate\". As long as you're not a parent I don't think you can understand how heavily this weighs.\n\nEdit: added part about faers","score":"-14","subreddit":"bestof"}

If you remember, the same people in the streets that denounced Russian for its alleged interference in Ukraine were also denouncing Europe for it's alleged abandonment of any moral values.

{"body":"Analysis of the girls' phones offers an astonishing dive into a troubled world. That of an adolescent without hope who is transcended by a mystical outcome. In an exchange of SMS messages with a friend, Camille gives a brief summary of her life as she perceives it at 14 years - marriage, children, death - accelerated by the simplifying dynamics of jihadist thought: \"I'll be married soon in Turkey with my husband and will soon be a mother, inshallah, then we will raise our child who will be born in the Sham, nothing more beautiful, and it will be a pious child, and then one day you'll get a phone call telling you that I died in battle and that's it, it's simple.\"\n\n*\"You should have seen him he was so handsome\"*\n\nIf the pressures of life and death enter into in their conversations, the teenagers also have discussions that might seem age appropriate if they were against the backdrop of a civil war. The new girlfriends of the route to radical Islam are very interested in certain fighters known from social networks, as well as the brand of their shoes: \n\nCamille: And uh ... Yesterday, you know, it was on Facebook, and there I see what, I see a picture of a brother, you know, it was Abu uh... something Guitone, you know him? \n\nFatima - Abu what? (...) \n\nCamille: - An then, oh damn, I saw he was martyred, ouch! I was too shocked I swear, this brother was too machallah [as Allah wills], I swear. You should have seen him he was so handsome. (Laughs) \n\nFatima: - Yeah? \n\nCamille: - Yeah, like, you know, on one of his pictures, you see, he had camo you see, camouflage, you know, military with Air Max; the brother, he's in the Cham and he's wandering around with Air Max. \n\nFatima: - They have Air Max in Cham? \n\nCamille: - Yeah, they have Air Max; yeah, you know, when they leave, you see, they pack their suitcase. And as usually, you know, they were all ex-delinquents, you see, they all wore Air Max. So the shoes they have in general are Air Max, you know what I mean?\n\nThis fascination the girls have with jihadists has been turned into a recruiting tool by Islamic State. According to the latest figures from the Interior Ministry, some 867 teenagers have been identified in France for radicalization. Between October 2013 and October 2015, the proportion of women among the French who went to Syria increased from 12% to 35% (218 of 593), while the flow of departures men changed slightly. Thirty-one percent of them are converts, compared to 23% of men, and their radicalization process is significantly faster. Girls make up the majority (51 adolescents) of the 84 French minors in Syria. Often separated from their family or school, they are mostly motivated by humanitarian or religious considerations, particularly related to the headscarf. Their hijra (\"emigration\") is sometimes controlled remotely by an older jihadist with whom they intend to achieve a precocious woman's dream: starting a family. Past the territorial conquest phase, the Islamic State has entered into a settlement logic and encourages unions to ensure the longevity of its project. Young converts, reputed to be more radical than the local women, are particularly popular with disaffected jihadists who spend most of their time on the Internet when they are not at the front. In a telephone tap, Camille describes her online success with the men, \"Yeah, and then after the brothers they added me [on Facebook], just to ask me if I would marry them and all, then voila. Then, they were kind, sometimes they were saying stuff like, advice, like, \"Do not go to mosques in France, because the mosques in France, they teach the wrong Islam; the true Islam is in the Cham, and all, and we will teach you everything, do not worry my sister and all.\" (...) Oh, I count most all marriage proposals I've had. (...) If you are promised and everything, yeah I will end up polygamous with 50 husbands there ... \" (laughs)\n\nSome online recruiters, like the correspondant who was behind the departure of Léa, \"Abu Saad Al Maghreb i\" - real name Brahim El Khayari - have made the recruitment of underage girls their specialty. This jihadist, 22, a native of Nimes, exchanged simultaneously on Facebook with Léa, Camille and Juliet, he has asked all three to marry him. The first French jihadist to appear in an Islamic State propaganda film, October 14, 2014, he spoke again recently in a video where he congratulated the attackers of 13 November 2015. Is this jihadist commissioned by EI to recruit young women or is he inhabited by a deep sense of loneliness? In any case the young man shows himself to be very insistent, not hesitating to \"put pressure\" on them, as the teens told the police, when they explained to him they couldn't join him quickly: \"Come tomorrow, after it will be too late, the borders will close, you would be able to get through any more.\"","score":"28","subreddit":"europe"}

I think Judaism is great, for reasons I won't get into here but which have to do with its emphasis on education and position on the afterlife, among others.\n\nOriginal post: The problem is that it's kinda half-true - the most prominent pro-Russian and vocally anti-Latvian \"activists\" here *are* Russian-speaking people of Jewish heritage.

Latvian-passport burning Russian revanchist Ilarions Girss is of Jewish heritage. National-Bolshevik \"eternal revolutionary\" and logistical+material supporter of separatists in Ukraine, going so far as to organize sending volunteers from Latvia over there, Vladimir Linderman is of Jewish heritage. Tatyana Zhdanoka, former Interfront (movement against Latvian independence during late Soviet years) organizer and now MEP from Latvia(us fascists, letting such a person get citizenship, run and be elected for the EU Parliament!) is a Jew. As is Aleksandrs Gaponenko, a slimy and nefarious pro-Russian historical revisionist and propagandist and general Latvia h8er.\n\nIt's the darndest thing. These are the most active and vitriolic pro-Russian,  anti-Latvian \"activists\" here - and they're all Jews!\n\nThere are others similarly noxious ones who are not of Jewish heritage, but they're [not the sharpest tools in the shed](http://uk.itvnet.lv/article/zinas/579400_640x420.jpg), and have definitely not attained such publicity and notoriety as the aforementioned ones.\n\nThe only psychological-historical explanation I can think of is a kind of double anger by Russian-speaking persons of Jewish heritage - regarding both the (non)status of Russian as an official language in Latvia as well as the crimes committed against Latvia's Jews by Nazis and their local collaborators in still-living memory.\n\nIf not that, then I guess I just have to go along with this MP - it really is \"clever Jews\" undermining Latvia's national security.","score":"23","subreddit":"europe"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; La Cour des comptes a adressé un référé à l’État sur les « risques » financiers du projet pharaonique du grand stade de rugby en Essonne, mais le premier ministre veut en faire un contrat d’intérêt national. Le stade doit coûter 600 millions d’euros, et le projet d’aménagement urbain chiffré à 263 millions est déficitaire, selon les documents obtenus par Mediapart. Un dossier qui n'est pas sans rappeler celui de Notre-Dame-des-Landes.\n\n\n«On a toujours rêvé d’un stade, se souvient Stéphane Raffalli, le maire de Ris-Orangis. Je me souviens qu’avec Manuel et Thierry [Manuel Valls et Thierry Mandon – ndlr], quand on se mettait devant une carte pour réfléchir à ce qu’on pourrait faire ici, on rêvait d’un stade ! » Le projet du grand stade de Ris-Orangis, porté par la Fédération de France de rugby (FFR) et l’agglomération d’Évry, est désormais un peu plus qu’un rêve, mais il vient de subir un désaveu cinglant. Début mars, la Cour des comptes a rendu publique une mise en garde à l’État face aux risques budgétaires et patrimoniaux que cet équipement lui fait courir. \n\nCe stade prévu pour 82 000 spectateurs, avec pelouse et toit rétractables, doit coûter 600 millions d’euros à la FFR, engager la garantie des collectivités à hauteur de 450 millions, et creuser un déficit pour le Stade de France qui accueille les matchs de la FFR – entre 161 et 186 millions d’euros à la charge de l’État. Un gouffre financier auquel il faut ajouter la mise à disposition de terrains, d’aménagements publics pour accueillir l’équipement, et un « projet urbain » intercommunal aujourd’hui déficitaire, selon les documents obtenus par Mediapart.\n\nCe projet de deuxième grand stade parisien est un peu le Notre-Dame-des-Landes du premier ministre. En effet, la Fédération de rugby ne prévoit de faire atterrir que onze matchs par an dans son futur équipement. Les 354 jours restants devront être meublés par de l’événementiel.\n\n« A minima », souligne la Cour des comptes, il revient à l’État « d’anticiper les conséquences budgétaires, juridiques et patrimoniales du projet de la FFR en tant que propriétaire d’un équipement, le Stade de France, pour lequel 760 millions d'euros de dépenses publiques ont été engagées depuis 1998 ». La FFR ayant jusqu’au 1er avril 2017 pour finaliser le contrat avec le groupement qu’elle a retenu, l’État dispose encore, selon la Cour, « de la possibilité d’agir ». La Cour lui recommande de « mettre à profit la période restant jusqu’en 2017 pour rechercher avec la FFR des alternatives au projet de stade de rugby ».\n\nIgnorant l’avertissement de la Cour des comptes, Manuel Valls, co-initiateur du projet en tant que président de l’agglomération d’Évry, met désormais tout en œuvre pour faire signer rapidement un contrat d’intérêt national (CIN) autour du futur grand stade de Ris-Orangis. Le premier ministre, qui préside le comité interministériel du Grand Paris, a déjà obtenu d’intégrer le site à l’opération d’intérêt national (OIN) du Grand Paris, en dépit du fait que les communes du sud de l’Essonne sont exclues du périmètre – le Grand Paris est limité à la petite couronne, soit les départements 92, 93 et 94. L’OIN est un dispositif permettant de « concentrer les moyens de l’État », et de peser sur le choix des opérateurs.\n\nParallèlement, Manuel Valls a aussi obtenu, via la mise en œuvre de la loi « Métropoles » de janvier 2014, l’intégration à son agglomération de 24 communes de l’Essonne et de Seine-et-Marne, rebaptisée Grand Paris Sud – Seine Essonne Sénart, soit 337 000 habitants. Cette super agglo a élu son exécutif le 14 mars dernier, après l’échec d’un recours engagé par un élu de Seine-et-Marne. Resté conseiller municipal d’Évry et membre du conseil communautaire – ainsi que Thierry Mandon –, Manuel Valls s’assure ainsi un retour à la tête d’un territoire élargi, à dimension de métropole, à l’horizon 2017 ou avant.\n\nIl y a presque quatre ans, le 26 juin 2012, peu avant de quitter la présidence de l’agglomération pour cause de cumul, Manuel Valls avait signé l’« accord-cadre » avec la FFR précisant les apports des collectivités locales au projet du stade, aux côtés de Thierry Mandon, ancien maire de Ris-Orangis – actuel secrétaire d’État chargé de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche – et de Jérôme Guedj, alors président du conseil général. Il avait aussi attribué, le 18 mai 2012, un marché d’assistance à maître d’ouvrage « pour les études liées à l’aménagement du site d’accueil du grand stade de rugby » à la petite société City Linked de son ex-compagne, Sybil Cosnard. City Linked avait auparavant obtenu le marché du dossier de candidature de l’agglomération d’Évry pour ce projet. Mediapart avait mis en évidence ce conflit d’intérêts, contesté par Manuel Valls, en 2014 – lire ici. « Tout le monde a le droit de travailler, fait remarquer Stéphane Raffalli. Mais il ne faut pas que ça prenne des proportions… Aujourd’hui, elle ne fait plus partie de l’équipe. »\n\n[L'un des marchés obtenus par City Linked, l'entreprise de l'ex-compagne de Manuel Valls](https://infographics.mediapart.fr/2016/evry/citylink/citylink.html). Passez votre curseur sur l'image pour l'agrandir. © DR\n\nDepuis, les architectes ont été désignés par la FFR d’une part, pour le grand stade, et par les collectivités locales d’autre part, pour le projet urbain. Côté collectivités, Djamel Klouche, du cabinet AUC, a été retenu le 2 octobre 2014, après 23 mois de dialogue compétitif. Il a notamment dessiné la passerelle piétonne qui enjambera l’A6 pour relier le stade à Ris-Orangis et à deux gares RER, un ouvrage monumental qui pèse à lui seul 31 millions d'euros hors taxes. Un montant similaire sera engagé par l'agglo pour la réalisation de 5 500 places de parking. Le 4 décembre 2014, Manuel Valls ne rate pas la présentation publique de la maquette du nouveau périmètre urbain : il en connaît déjà les moindres détails.\n\nComme les synergies intercommunales qu'il peut préciser aux invités. Le cabinet d'architectes de Djamel Klouche est par ailleurs retenu par la ville de Ris-Orangis pour un projet de « Coulée verte » et par l’agglomération voisine Cœur d’Essonne pour les aménagements de la base aérienne désaffectée 217 de Brétigny-sur-Orge. « C’est un architecte qu’on a repéré dans le cadre du Grand Paris, résume Stéphane Raffalli. Il a une sensibilité, c’est un doctrinaire, un faiseur, un urbaniste intéressant sur la question de l’écologie urbaine. » Klouche a aussi été « repéré » au « Laboratoire des idées » du Parti socialiste, durant la présidentielle de 2012…\n\nSelon un document interne à l’agglomération obtenu par Mediapart, le coût du projet urbain établi par le cabinet AUC s’élève à 263 millions d’euros, et s’avère déficitaire de 120 millions d’euros – les recettes étant chiffrées à 143,4 millions.\n\n[Les scores obtenus par les trois cabinets d'architectes, où figure leur chiffrage du coût de l'opération](https://infographics.mediapart.fr/2016/evry/couts/couts.html). Passez votre curseur sur l'image pour l'agrandir. © DR\n\n« C’est très déficitaire aujourd’hui, confirme Stéphane Raffalli. Mais le bilan, dans ses recettes, n’apparaîtra que lorsque l’on saura qui investit à cet endroit. Je travaille pour que des partenaires fondent avec nous ce projet. » Les coûts du projet urbain de Djamel Klouche pourraient par ailleurs avoir été sous-estimés : ils sont en effet inférieurs de 104 millions à l’évaluation de ses concurrents du cabinet Leclercq.","score":"20","subreddit":"france"}

For instance, a \"man-eating ostrich\" would be much more threatening than a \"man eating ostrich.\" (The hyphenated phrase makes \"man-eating\" an adjective, whereas \"man eating\" just tells you what a given individual is doing.)

The game may be good or bad, but this has nothing to do with that.\n\nThe original Elder Scrolls games were infinite and procedural, with procedural creatures and zones and even equipment.\n\nMorrowind was better than all of them, and it was hand crafted and much much smaller.\n\nDwarf fortress is insanely procedural, to a depth far beyond anything NMS is likely to be, but that's still not the selling point!

However, I also don't agree that he is a simply a dirty player who flips like a switch for random reasons.\n\nHis 2012 suspension for the elbow on Daniel Sedin was retaliation for [this hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3r9769DFOQ).

Just that saying there are two sides to Keith is correct, however it's not random malice, it's instances where he had some fairly egregious plays made on him that could easily have resulted in injury to himself.\n\nPart of me also wonders if we would be at the point we are if the officials had made the proper call on ice, rather than Keith feeling he had to dole out his vigilante justice.\n\nI don't know, I just hope this is the last time we see this side of Keith.\n\n","score":"19","subreddit":"hockey"}

It blows my mind how anyone can praise Chevy for never addressing the teams greatest need.\n\nWinnipeg is improving, but to praise their management for it is crazy in my opinion.

Without such intense cravings, I was able to tackle other issues (emotional eating which didn't just vanish with physical appetite, drinking, etc).

The score was really great in some places. Lex and Wonder Woman's respective themes were both fantastic. I couldn't hear anything really distinctive or memorable for Batman, though, and it was nice to hear the MoS theme whenever it came up. The Dark Knight Returns imagery was all pretty good, but I could have done without anything relating to The Death of Superman.\n\nAlso, people are giving the Batman training montage shit, but I'm a sucker for those. \n\nI'd give it a 4/10. For reference, MoS I'd say is a 6/10. I was pretty opinionated in this post, so I'm expecting downvotes, but I'd really like to hear if anyone else was as dumbfounded as I was by that representation of Batman. I was sitting there in shock for a lot of it. \n\n","score":"16","subreddit":"movies"}

Fuck you Zach Snyder for thinking I'd be gullible enough to buy it.\n\nThe editing was a complete mess - there was no flow.

They literally just hopped right into them talking with maybe a half second of an establishing shot).\n\nBatman kills people.\n\nThe whole movie was rolled out in the second trailer. In fact, literally every scene in the actual Batman v Superman fight can be pieced together from every trailer and tv spot out there. Except the end, which was bogus but I admit could've been worse (I was expecting a heartfelt plea from Lois). \n\nLex is annoying and while he plays the character well there is absolutely no explanation as to why he hates Superman.

Scenes are stiched together with absolutely no rhyme or reason. There is no connective tissue that leads from one scene to another. It's sloppy and bloated. Most of the Lois stuff could have been cut.\n\nThere is no actual plot. Just a series of subplots that are all haphazardly tied together, assuming they didn't completely drop that aspect of the plot in this first place. I've seen people praising the Senate scene while I clearly missed what that scene was meant to accomplish other than making it clear Lex is bad and make Batman (who already hated Superman) mad. Because the ramifications of that scene are dropped literally seconds after it occurs.\n\nPeople defend the movie by saying, \"Well the fights scenes are good.\" That's great. Except I didn't care about what was going on. I'm not going to enjoy fights scenes if I think the context in which they are taking place is stupid. Which it was. This isn't \"Batman V. Superman\". It's \"Batman Hates Superman And Is Going Out of His Way to Kill Him\". There is no philosophical battle between the two. There is no ideology. Batman just wants to kill him. \n\nAnd the final act is bloated garbage. Again, we suffer through two acts of random scenes only for everything to come to ahead at the very last second. So, like Man of Steel, we get 30+ minutes of extended action scenes at the very end. By the time Doomsday was introduced, I was just sick of it at that point.\n\nSo yes, it was that bad in my opinion. And, at the very least, Age of Ultron was competently put together and actually had a through line to get us where we needed to go as an audience. Most aspects of the plot actually tied together and were crucial the story. And I don't like Age of Ultron at all. But it's a more competently made film than BvS. Age of Ultron was boring and the very definition of mediocre. But it wasn't sloppy.","score":"48","subreddit":"movies"}

In Batman begins it establishes how the wealth inequality in the city has created people so desperate to get money that they resort to crime; this serves multiple purposes, it creates the backdrop for the crime in gotham that has become so commonplace that it's the reason for the league of shadows to destroy gotham(meaningful problem that DRIVES the plot). His father's last words \"don't be afraid\" tie into the theme of the scarecrow and his use of fear as a weapon. In BVS his dad's last words are \"martha\" which is just a magic phrase that makes batman forget his hatred for superman (which took the whole movie to develop and rendered all that development pointless.) just because their moms have the same name? Bat levitation. pointless desert dream. Jesse Eisenberg was complete garbage as lex luthor. without a good villain you don't have good conflict. Conflict drives your story folks. No conflict=no story as in why does Lex want to kill superman? Just for random fun? that works if you're a random chaotic character (The joker) so he has no meaningful motivations for doing whatever it is he is doing thus we have no reason to care about him. Every time Lex said \"my father used to say,\" we DON'T CARE about your father; we care about you. what do you have to say? random edgy crap? let's move on. Pointless religious imagery. Blatant product placement for the Jeep renegade within the first ten minutes. destroying zod was the greater good that involved destroying a couple of buildings. this cannot be overlooked by batman until he says the aforementioned magic word. zod bod was pointless they could have just made doomsday a fresh new villain that had nothing to do with zod. wonderwoman was not developed at all so how is she good again? she looked like a sick greyhound not like a warrior princess. why does she want to help? we don't know. again no reason to care for her. Lois looks like she's 50 in that movie wtf. why was she randomly in the desert? it doesn't matter superman can find her if she needs help there but can't find mommy if she needs help in an adjacent city when she's being kidnapped? And he gets his rescue missions from random kitchen t.vs? he's a journalist shouldn't he use a better way? Oh. there's a fire in Mexico and one little girl trapped, better ignore everybody else in the world and fly there asap because Mexico doesn't have firefighters? was that really his top priority at that time? flood scene and rocket explosion scene was pointless. we know what superman can do show us something new. fight scene was garbage. Batman used a smoke screen for supes to lose sight of him...the man has xray vision and a smoke screen worked on him? Superman holds onto grenades. superman breathes in obviously noxious vape.(superman losing to vape) superman can't hold his breath? Ben affleck can swing superman around like a lasso. superman says save martha then batman is like oh my bad bro i wasn't gona impale you just now it was a prank bro! random dude gives Lex access to ship and zod bod...for what? why? doesn't matter. doomsday was garbage. what are his motives? grr angry? i don't care about him. we are given no reasons to care about the character. There is no meaningful villain conflict to drive the plot. no plot , poor characters...how is this a good movie? meaningful Plot and characters make a movie. Good production and visuals yeah but nothing backing that up. Justice league previews..just..the cyborg one looked horrible and Why does Lex keep tabs on metahumans? we aren't SHOWN or told so it doesn't matter so it didn't help drive the plot. nothing helped drive the plot. there is no plot. i'm missing out on some more things that i can't remember but that's enough to give this movie a 2/10.

It's a welcome bit of levity with a significant undertone: maybe Rorschach really isn't all there; maybe he's not really capable of having a friend.\n\nIn the movie, it's just a regular handshake.\n\nThe thing about this that really kills me is that an awkward pause is a little tricky for a comic book, but it's *so easy* for a film.\n\nSnyder transcribed the event, but missed the wordless interaction that made it meaningful.","score":"43","subreddit":"movies"}

The controls were such that it's sometimes more challenging than it should be to make accurate fine adjustments to the direction the character is facing to align him with, say, a narrow bridge to cross or a jump to make. (*EDIT: Contrast this with, say, Mythos of the World Axis, which does a fantastic job of this.*)  The game seems to compensate for this some by being rather forgiving if you're off by a little on something critical.  Not ideal, but acceptable.\n\nAs far as game mechanics, it's nothing surprising or new.  But the artwork, atmosphere and (especially) sound design are so astonishingly good that the game mechanics don't need to pull more than their fair share of the weight.  They're so good, in fact, that I got myself killed several times because I'd stopped moving to gawk at some creature or take in the incredible sounds.\n\nThe story is clearly loosely based on H.P. Lovecraft's \"At the Mountains of Madness.\"  And \"loosely based\" is an excellent choice-- Lovecraft is superb for inspiration, but his stories and characters often fail to live up to the atmosphere and mythos.\n\nI did make it to the end of the 'level' on demo and got some hints of the backstory and the way the game might play out.

But it happens too much in a season that the most talented players of the academy get bought by rich English clubs. \n\n- Artificial grass. 52% of the clubs from the Eredivisie (6/18) and the Jupiler League play on artificial grass. The KNVB does absolutely nothing about it. \n\n- Shit system. #4, #5, #6 and #7 will play play-offs at the end of the season for a Europa League Qualification ticket. So this basically means that even though #7 might have 30 points fewer than the #4 and still have an insanely high chance to reach Europe. A lot of times this has meant the worst team ended up in Europe. Being eliminated immediately. \n\n- Same goes for the bottom 3 clubs. The last club will relegate. The second- and third last clubs will also play play-offs against teams in the Jupiler League. All these things just don't add up and it often makes clubs play in a League they just aren't good enough for. If the bottom 3 of the Eredivisie would just relegate and the top 3 of the Jupiler League would get promotion the clubs would be in the League they belong in. \n\n- Speaking of the 'worst team'. There are 3 big clubs in The Netherlands, being Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord. At the end of every season the best players of those worst teams are likely to join one of those 3 clubs. Resulting those clubs basically have to start over every season. Resulting in very little competition for Ajax and PSV. (Feyenoord not so much, since we're still pretty shit :-), but still a club with a massive fan base and will most likely always end up in the top 3)\n\n- No tv money. \n- Not caring about fans. At all. \n- Empty stadiums in the Jupiler League because matches get played on Monday evenings mostly. All because of Fox Sports. Again, the KNVB doesn't care. \n- The Jupiler League is just so fucked up, mostly because of incredibly stupid decisions by the KNVB. \n- Speaking of which, the KNVB is one of the richest federations I believe.\n\nTl;Dr: This list could be so much longer, but it basically comes down to the KNVB not taking any measures to fix any of this shit. \n\n*Also see comments below ","score":"29","subreddit":"soccer"}

{"body":"Speed of the ball is pretty much a non-factor strictly in the geometry of hitting a flat serve into the service box. You can theoretically hit a billion mile per hour serve a 5'9\" and have it go in. I did the math, and basically you end up getting the result that if you can make contact at 8.5 feet off the ground (which is a reasonable assumption if you're making contact with your arm extended, a racquet of average length, and jumping), then you don't even need to factor in the fact that gravity is helping you. A purely straight line serve hit at any speed 8.5 feet above the ground that just barely clears the net will impact the service line.\n\nAnd that's assuming you're serving from the hash to the T. Slide out wide and the geometry becomes even more favorable. Also, if you jump into the court (you should), the geometry becomes more favorable. Then when you factor in gravity, slower speeds are helped out even more.\n\nOf course, the *real* benefit to height when you serve is that you have a bigger margin of error. Then, if you clear the net by more (because you're taller), your ball will land shorter, meaning it has popped up higher in the air and your opponent might be returning from way outside his strike zone.\n\nIf you look at the data, you find a weak but existing correlation between height and max recorded serve speed. But the alternative explanation for this is that if you're tall and don't have as good of mobility, you *have* to compensate by developing a huge serve. A shorter player can focus on other aspects and not rely on that.\n\nAnyway, the math is this: http://imgur.com/yGizgft\n\nNow if x is the height of the ball, then x is approximately server's height + server's jump + distance from elbow to center of palm (where racquet butt goes) + length of racquet minus probably three inches to account for you hitting the sweet spot and not the frame.\n\nTake me. I'm 5'9\". The distance from my wrist to elbow is 14\". My racquet is 27\". Without jumping at all, that means I can make contact with the ball at 5'9\"+14\"+27\"-3\" = 8'11\". Plenty of clearance.\n\nIf you're of average height (5'9\" is below average in the US and well below average on the tour), there is no height-based reason why you are incapable of blasting an Isner serve.","score":"-3","subreddit":"tennis"}

Their economic reforms were disastrous and caused widespread famine and social unrest.  Around 50 million people starved to death under the Great Leap Forward.  Then there was a cultural revolution that went about dismantling their cultural heritage and purging the roots of capitalism.  You can read about all about it here.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution\n\nNow you look at Hong Kong.  This island was basically colonized by the British to get tea.  It was the trading hub of all the Western countries in the region.  They enjoyed the benefits of English rule in that they got relatively free speech, education, and the general bonus for being an economic success.  Nobody exports civilization like the British did.\n\nThese two parts of China went through alternative timelines and are as a result two very different places.  The British ceded back to China Hong Kong under the provision that they remain independent for 50 years.  We are currently in that time period.  It is proving to be independence in theory but not in practice.  People in Hong Kong are not happy at all.  Free speech is being eroded away at, elections are rigged so only candidates vetted by the communist party are allowed to run, and there are regular protests in the streets.
