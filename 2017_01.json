This means that as a female grows older, her pod becomes increasingly full of her own children and grandchildren.

This creates a powerful impetus to shift her efforts away from having more children, and towards helping her existing descendants.\n\n\u0026gt;That impetus doesn’t exist in elephants because their sons eventually leave their birth group to find new ones.

If they turn up anything serious, I think the Republicans in Congress will bet that they can blackmail Trump more effectively than Putin.

While undergraduates can receive a B.A. in Architecture (awarded officially by Yale College), Yale Architecture itself is a graduate school, awarding M.Archs and PhDs. If the architects look anything like those at my design school (not an architect, but I'm in a related program), they're probably in their late twenties on average with a lot of PhD students and post-professionals in their thirties. \n\nBut that's besides the point. Anyways, after the election the American Institute of Architects (AIA) issued a press-release saying, in part, that its members \"are committed to working with President-elect Trump to address the issues our country faces, particularly strengthening the nation’s aging infrastructure.\" The AIA is the leading professional/accrediting body for American architects and it has a lot of power to shape the field-- think of the American Bar Association, for instance. It did not consult its membership prior to issuing the conciliatory-toned remarks.\n\nInstitutional members of the AIA (including Yale School of Architecture, the Chicago School of Architecture, the Harvard School of Design, etc.), some regional chapters, and prominent individual architects came out in opposition to the statement, which they saw as volunteering their services to projects that in some cases violate professional codes of ethics about environmental and social responsibility.\n\nThe banner is a clear response to the AIA National's presumptuous, half-baked statement (and is part of a larger power struggle in the organization/the profession), not a more general \"Fuck Trump!\" sentiment. So yeah, \"Who thought he would ask them to?\" They were volunteered, without their consent. Anyone who knows about the AIA statement would understand what the banner is getting at.

The cat want allowed in the house, so we were trying to keep it on the down low.\n\nMy buddy is sleeping and I'm trying to pet the cat, but she's not having it and runs off and hides in the ceiling. At the time, I didn't see where she went and I was looking all over the basement for her. I decide to check upstairs. Before I could reach the top of the stairs, there's a loud crash. I went back down, made a second sweep, then went back up.\n\nI got upstairs and noticed the computer was on. That means someone is probably still awake, so I went the other way. Again, the cat shouldn't be inside and I didn't want to have to explain what I was looking for. Decided to use the bathroom while I was up there, finished up and went to wash my hands. There were several adult teeth sitting next to the sink with fresh blood around them. Fuck. What happened here? I washed my hands and decided to ask his mom about the cat. I've been searching for awhile and I'm starting to worry that I somehow chased the cat out of the house. I turn the corner and saw her, but I didn't quite comprehend what I was seeing. The light was poor so I had a hard time focusing.\n\n\"Hey have you seen (buddy's) cat?\"\n\n\"Go down stairs, jfugate95!\"\n\n\"Hey, um, what's with the teeth in the bathroom?\"\n\n\"GET DOWN STAIRS, I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT AGAIN!\"\n\nI went downstairs. Not about to test my luck. I thought she was mad about the cat, hence the shouting. But as I'm walking downstairs, I start to realize what I saw. She was stark fucking naked. Welp, I just saw my best friend mom nude and didn't even immediately realize it.\n\nI found out later the next day that her and my buddy's step dad got in a fight outside. He punched her in the face, hence the teeth, and she broke the window to get inside to get away from him, hence the loud crash. Still don't know why she was naked.","score":"43","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"I just posted this on a similar thread last night but I'll share again. \n\nMy school did this trip to a Christian camp up north (I live in Michigan) every year. Because the school was so small I knew all the class moms like they were my own, so I had grown up with all the chaperones on this camp trip. The cabin had sort of a weird vibe to it but I don't remember if it was because it was unfamiliar or what. One night, everyone is asleep or at least pretending to be asleep and I'm just lying there looking around, trying to sleep, and I see this woman walking around looking at everyone in their beds. Like, checking near everyone's face. I don't recognize her at all but I'm not bothered. She eventually makes her way to my bunk bed. I'm on the top, a classmate's mom took the bottom. Weird lady leans down to check the mom first and I close my eyes almost all the way. She stands back up, and I definitely do not recognize her even through my almost-closed eyes, and she whispers \"I know you're awake. Go to sleep.\" Didn't recognize her voice either. She goes on to the next bunk. Next morning the mom in the bunk below me asks if I'd gotten up in the night and I said no. I ask other girls if they saw this lady and they all said no. Counselors legally weren't allowed in the cabin and this lady was way too old to have been any of the staff at the camp - everyone was pretty young and the lady I saw was around late middle age. \n\nLater on there were older girls in the school talking vaguely about a ghost in the girls' cabin. For whatever reason I didn't bring up what I saw. \n\nLess paranormal-mysterious but still creepy:\n\nSummer a few years ago, night before my birthday. My dogs got in a fight with a skunk around 11pm and so my mom and I were in the driveway washing them. I was in my underwear and a tank top because I didn't want skunk smell on any of my real clothes. My mom went inside to get something and this car drives by real slow, so slow that their brake lights were on. It stops in front of my house and I brush it off like \"yeah this is probably quite a sight, dogs crosstied to cars and being sprayed with hoses in the middle of the night, some chick in her underwear, whatever\" and the car drives off. Fifteen minutes later it comes back and does the same thing. I stop and watch it until it goes by, never ever picking up speed as it goes. I go inside and tell my mom there's some weird car driving by real slow and can she please come outside so I'm not out there alone. She goes outside and waits, fifteen minutes later the car drives by again, still slow. I go down to the end of the driveway as it goes by to see the license plate number but I'm standing near a tree to avoid drawing attention to myself. The car comes to a complete stop as it passes and the driver adjusts the rearview mirror and doesn't drive off until I go back up the driveway. Give my mom the plate number. We wait. Car comes by again, real slow again, and my mom being the good white lady she is calls the police. They say \"oh yeah, we get calls about that all the time. We'll come check it out.\" We finish washing the dogs and go inside around 1am and the car has still been going by at regular intervals going suuuuper slow. \n\nI get to bed eventually and wake up the next morning around 8am because there's some banging on my screen. From where my bed is, I can look up under the bottom of my blinds while laying down and see a bit outside. I'm thinking it's my mom trying to wake me to do yardwork or my dad trying to get me to come open the door for him because he lost his key or whatever, and I really don't want to because I'm exhausted so I just act like I can't hear it. I can see a shadow moving across the blinds outside while the banging continues. It stops for a while but the shadow stays still and I put on my glasses so I can see outside through the crack under my blinds. After a few minutes the banging starts up again and the shadow is moving again and I can see what looks like a woman's hand with a silver watch banging on my window. My mom wore a silver watch my whole life and so I think again it's her trying to wake me up, until I remembered her watch broke a couple years before and she wears a digital one now. I'm starting to freak out a little and I lie there and wait until the banging stops and the shadow goes away and then I text all my friends asking if they were just at my house banging on my window and they're all, hours later, like \"no dude we wouldn't get up that early even for you on your birthday.\" My mom has no idea what I'm talking about. I freak out a little and my family just shrugs it off and says if it happens again we'll do something.  \n\nI've seen the car driving around still, a couple times during the day but mostly at night, and it's some weird old lady who will do that all night long. If someone has their lights on she'll stop and look at their house. A couple times she's stopped outside our house and my dad will go down to the road to ask her what she's doing but she just drives away at a breakneck 2mph once he gets to her car.

{"body":"After really studying and researching the topic I eventually came to the conclusion that neither side of this argument is right. The anti-circumcision crowd is dead wrong about everyone experiencing decreased sensitivity and totally whitewashes the hygienic value of it. The pro-circumcision crowd wants to play down the fact that it is really not a medically necessary procedure and that a botched circumcision can cause decreased sensitivity and life long trauma for an individual. The biggest sticking point is the \"choice\" debate, which has merit BUT overlooks the fact that an overwhelming majority of males - snipped and unsnipped - are perfectly happy with their phallus in it it's current state and in no way wish it was the opposite. [There have been many studies on sexual sensitivity with and without and the baseline answer is that on average it makes no difference](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2006/02/or_not_to_snip.html).

{"body":"Pretty much everything I am seeing posted here is very commonly known to be a myth.\n\nSome that are actually really widely accepted are the myths around the phenomenon usually called \"squirting\" in women. This has now been proven quite conclusively by ultrasound to simply be dilute urine straight from the bladder. Many researchers had already suspected this since there is no organ other than the bladder in the female pelvis that could even theoretically hold that much liquid. \n\nIt is also not, for most women who experience it, associated with orgasm or even any increased pleasure. There is such an association for some women though. Basically it's just a type of urinary incontinence and is not even a sexual response.\n\nCurrent evidence is that there *is* a true female ejaculation phenomenon, but it is much more rare, and involves a much smaller amount of milky fluid. It's difficult even to notice.\n\nTo get ahead of the legion of people who will link me older studies and claim that 7 is too small a sample size, I have heard it *all* before. I won't respond to any argument that does not include an explanation for:\n\n1.) How it's possible that 7 women all exhibiting classic \"squirting\" were all found to simply be emitting urine with the same mechanism. If this isn't the normal explanation for squirting, isn't it bizarre that all 7 of these women happened to not be \"real squirters\" in precisely the same way? 7 isn't a sufficient number to show, absent of any other common sense considerations, that this is definitely the mechanism for *all* women who squirt, but it is well enough to show that it is, at the very least, quite common. Since there is no other potential mechanism that makes any sense, it's likely the truth for all women who experience this.\n\n2.) If you assume then that there is some other, mysterious mechanism that none of these 7 women happened to experience but most squirters do, where on Earth is all that liquid being stored? It's often like half a liter of liquid involved and there is just nowhere in the area but the bladder that could do that.","score":"50","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"At my jail, we had a non violent criminal in lockdown with a violent one. Bad dude killed the other guy with a colored pencil through the eyeball. Being a woman, I was working female facility so only heard all the chatter over the radio. Speaking of eyeballs, also had a guy pull one of his out. Also didn't see that one. \n\nWorst I dealt with were just the stories when I would talk to my girls. So many crying sessions as they discussed their childhood. One that stands out the most: had this girl none of the COs could stand. She was constantly in trouble and getting put in lockdown. I had a very good rapport with her though. Came in one day and she was in a cell doing typical \"acting out\" She had calmed down but was getting riled up again. I went to see her since she always behaved with me. Turns out her aunt who was also in the facility  had just been sentenced to death. This woman, Margaret Allen if anyone's interested in looking it up, had killed a woman by cutting her throat and pouring bleach in it and her mouth, then buried her still alive.\n\nAnyway the young girl was upset over this and even I was like, look, that fucking bitch deserves death, you need to behave and don't get in more trouble or lose sleep over this. So she proceeded to tell me why she loved her so much. As a kid, around 6, she was in an apt with a few other little cousins, when some guys broke in to kill the parents. They were cooking crack at the time. So the 10 year old shoos all the kids into a closet and tells them to be quiet. This girls best friend, same age, hears screaming and runs out and is also shot dead. The oldest kid wasn't able to stop her. Long story short, this aunt who was just sentenced to death took her and the other kids in and kind of raised them off and on and always made sure they were taken care of. All lived in the same apt complex. \n\nThose of us who aren't raised in such poverty and violence have no idea how bad kids in this country fucking have it. I sat and cried with her a good hour, and thanks OP for asking this question you ass. Now I'm crying again. Ugh\n\nSo much tragedy. I learned a lot in my years as a CO. I see old inmates often. I get hugs and cries thanking me, or see girls full of pride for doing well. I've even had them find me on Facebook to ask for help bc they're spiraling out of control again. Ok now I'm rambling. \n\nEdit: wow this really blew up. I want to thank everyone for their kind words. It means a lot. I left that job a few years ago to go to nursing school. I'm now a psych RN in our county crisis stabilization unit. I wanted to be able to do more for this population. Substance abuse and mental illness can be helped, a horribly traumatic childhood beyond comprehension can not.

In the 7 years I've been using it, I've saved estimated $500. The biggest convenience for me is not having to deal with running out of supplies mid-period. When you go to a male friend's house, you don't have to wonder if he has a trash can in his bathroom where you can discreetly throw away your pad or tampon wrappers because there's nothing to throw away. It also reduces environmental period waste.  \n\nThe only caveat: the first day you wear it, it does feel uncomfortable, which scares off many women. Give it a day or two, and it won't feel like anything at all. It isn't for everybody, but it stops getting uncomfortable for most people.\n\nAlso, always pee after sex.

{"body":"I love to share the story about how I inadvertently started a religious battle but never see a thread for it.\n\nLast year I worked at a summer camp at a college campus for kids from all over the country. The main office is in New York and the camp is very expensive so we ended up getting a lot a rich kids from Long Island, so about a quarter of our kids are Jewish. The kids and staff start figuring this out in the first week.\n\nOne afternoon my duty is to lead a game of ultimate frisbee which I'm pretty excited about because I love frisbee. When I walk outside one of the kids throws a low pass to me and I'm able to make a nice one handed snag.\n\nKid says \"whoah, are you Jewish?\"\n\nI'm like, \"Uh... no?\"\n\nTurns out the kids had divided themselves into \"Jews\" and \"non-Jews.\" The other staff are pissed but I'm determined to not let the kids push my buttons. I tell them that they can pick their friends for teams but they can't call themselves the \"Jew team.\"\n\nWe walk over to the field and see college kids, so I approach them and talk so we split up the field. We start playing, and one team ends up with most of the Jewish kids. They're coordinated and fairly athletic so they start dominating the other kids. The Jew team starts acting cocky and every time they score they make a circle and dance while chanting in Hebrew.\n\nWe take a drink break and all but the Jewish kids leave. They're really cocky and ask if they can play the college kids playing nearby. The college kids look like dorks so I say yes and go over. I introduce myself and the college kids agree to play us.\n\nWe start and one of the college kids with a bowl cut and shin-high white socks bombs a hammer down the field to another kid with cargo shorts. Me and all the Jewish kids are stunned. They brush it off as luck but soon the dorky college kids are destroying us. I even join in to help but pretty soon we are losing 10-2.\n\nWe're getting tired so we say next point will be the last. Our team makes one pass before a college kid with half-inch thick glasses swats the frisbee out of the air and passes down the field for the winning point. I'm laughing by now and go over to thank the college kids, saying that our kids we're getting cocky and taken down a peg.\n\nThe college kids laugh about it and say no problem. I ask if they're just friends or part of a group and they tell me this:\n\n\"Oh we're part of Disciple Makers Christian Fellowship.\"\n\nAnd I panic because I basically just set up a game of Christians vs. Jews. I also remember that this particular Christian group ministers to college kids through ultimate frisbee and the interns basically practice year round.\n\nI told my boss, who's Jewish, about it later and he thought it was pretty funny but did talk about it with the kids later.\n\nTL;DR: Set up an event between Christians and Jews, Jews lost.","score":"214","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

If an engineer has a bad day a designs a flawed component, then maybe a cars brakes don't function, or a bridge is structurally flawed,  worst case lives are lost, best case the engineer gets fired and can't find another job.  If an attorney screws up a case then maybe an innocent person goes to jail and good luck getting an more clients.    I know not all lawyers and engineers are the same but the ones doing the high risk stuff are the ones making the money.  \n\n2.  I work in engineering and can tell you with absolute certainty that women doing equal work make equal pay as the men.  If they aren't then it's up to the individual to renegotiate their salary.

Shows like these didn't really exist when I was young, so before I offer an opinion what I think happens today, based on my experiences, here are a couple of times explicit stuff came up for me in my career, off the top of my head:\n\nWhen I was 10, I did a movie called The Buddy System. The character I played was supposed to be pretty foul-mouthed, and I recall that there was a whole big thing being made about how I couldn't say \"bastard\" for some reason. I remember the director had me say \"bad man\" and something else, with the intention of blending the two words together in postproduction.\n\nI recall when we worked on Stand By Me, that River and his family were *really* uncomfortable with Chris telling Ace \"go home and fuck your mother some more\", and that there was a lot of tension about him delivering that line. I vaguely recall that they wanted to change it, and it was determined that he had to say that, specifically, so motivate Ace deciding to kill him.\n\nI don't know what they do with kids today, but I presume that young actors learn their lines, and their parents and acting coaches tell them what they need to know so they can make it believable. Most kids who are good at being actors are actually good at taking direction, and any director can make it clear to a kid that their character is afraid or embarrassed or however a kid would feel if he or she was talking about something explicit in real life.\n\nDoes this answer the question?","score":"150","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"I went on a date with a girl a few months ago where she picked the spot (sushi, a place I hadn’t been – I LOVE sushi, so awesome), I was there on time, she wasn’t – she texted me and said “I’m looking for a place to park”, which was odd because it was downtown Phoenix on a Wednesday night and there was plenty of parking. I told her there were spots in the lot behind the sushi spot where I parked. It took her 20 minutes to find a parking spot and show up – 20 very uncomfortable minutes where I held up a table in a restaurant which was VERY small and people were being turned away, basically every employee stopped by and asked “so.. are you ready?” which was them really saying “hey asshole! We have customers HERE NOW, ready to order!” – ugh. \n\nSo she shows up, sits down and casually sweeps the chopsticks in front of her off the table onto the floor – I look at her questioningly, trying to figure out what the fuck, and says “I hate those things, so stupid, why didn’t *those people* just invent forks?” nothing like a little casual racism between strangers, right? – I literally looked around the restaurant, full 360, trying to locate the cameras because I was clearly on some kind of punk’d-like show. Nope. It was real. \n\nShe also took not one but TWO phone calls during the “date” neither of which were important enough to warrant the interruption – I know that because she took them AT THE TABLE WITH ME THERE. \n\nShe also told me she didn’t “know what was going on” and didn’t “really care” in reference to the uhh you know, very important election which was happening – she also told me she never knows what’s going on because she doesn’t pay attention to the news or “events and stuff” – which, to be fair, not everyone has to be up on current events, but I prefer to be with someone who does. \n\nWe ate, (the sushi was meh at best – fitting, I suppose), I paid…. Now here’s the thing, I was at a point then where I was a veteran dater (I’ve since found a fantastic gf, thank god), I was going on one or two dates a week (could have been more but that was my personal cut-off, I felt any more and the dates wouldn’t get the attention and energy they should), I was doing bumble, tinder, meetup, going out, meeting people, getting laid, etc. I’m not bragging, I’m just saying; I was doing a bunch of dating. And here is how I approach the elephant that is “who pays on the first date”; I go into the date assuming I am going to pay, I am fine with that, I don’t mind, and I do not think that paying entitles me to ANYTHING; no kiss, no sex, no second date, no text – nothing. It entitles me to nothing. I just happen to not mind paying, it makes shit easier, and I make decent money, it’s not a big deal – HOWEVER, I do think it’s courteous for the date to at least OFFER to split, to which I will say “no it’s okay, really” and if the date went well maybe I’ll add “maybe you can get the next one” – and if the girl insists on splitting, then we split – easy peazy…….  When the waiter dropped the check, this girl literally looked up at the ceiling, at the next table over, at the door, the wall, everywhere EXCEPT the check. No offer to split, no comment on it, no “thank you”, just the absolute certainty that I would pay. And that annoyed me. \nSo I paid, said “it was nice to meet you”, got up and walked out. \n\n…so yeah, sorry, bit of a rant, but don’t do any of that on a first date\n\n***TL;DR: crappy first date story***","score":"731","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

This contributes to making the characters themselves look a little uglier than the previous season (at least imo).  However, the way the characters move has improved.  They are moving a lot more with quite a bit of good bouncy and smearing action.  A worse character design isn't really worse animation.  However, since we are only one episode in I can't really say one way or the other if the current chubby character design will stick or if the animation will go downhill/uphill.  Thus, I don't think it's fair to claim s2 is drastically different from s1 when we don't really know what direction the show will be heading in visually.  For all we know this chubby style could be abandoned next episode.","score":"18","subreddit":"anime"}

I guess this is one of those “look what cool things I can make” by GoHands?\n\nThe plot itself is as Konvoluted and Konfusing as another certain GoHands series, and while the animation is flashy and moving like there’s too much budget, to me they move *way* too much, to the point that it’s just meaningless and takes away from trying to understand it all. Like, there’s a reason why there isn’t much mob movement in other anime, which is to allow viewers to focus solely on the main characters talking. Too much movement (and clear movement) doesn't give us a chance to concentrate on what we need to, which can be jarring at times because we don't know what we need to look at.\n\nAccording to the staff, apparently episode 9 is crazy…but waiting 9 weeks for it?

The word \"very\" has a place, in my opinion. I agree that describing something as \"very tall\" is problematic because it doesn't create a clear image. But \"very\" is a good way to emphasize a descriptor when no other word can work. The best example I can think of on the spot would be the following sentence: \"The orange was very bitter, so he threw it away.\" I think \"very\" is crucial here because it emphasizes the bitterness. Without it, some meaning is lost. Some people like bitter oranges, but describing it as \"very bitter\" gets across the right point. And there is no other word that can suitably replace \"very bitter\", as far as I know. You might replace the word bitter with acrid or acidic...but these don't quite have the same meaning. So when you have a descriptor that is perfect but needs to be heightened, I think adding \"very\" is a quick, appropriate way to do it.    ","score":"18","subreddit":"writing"}

A good smack on the back of the head is a very memorable motivator. You don't forget it and will remember why you got it. It hurts physically but does no lasting damage. It teaches a lesson immediately with all but a very few children. \n\nHundreds of generations of humanity developed just fine this way. Abuse is different. Bruising or injuring a child is not right. A sharp physical reminder of why they shouldn't do something followed by an explanation of why they shouldn't is fine. \n\nI could beat my 14 year old son unconscious and he would wake up still being defiant so it wouldn't work with him. My daughter is 5 and I'm sure it would work with her. Words are useless with that little shit. She just gives you some hardcore side eye when you try and correct her. Timeout is nothing to her. I'd bet a years pay that if I gave her a case of \"the red ass\" a few times her attitude would change. \n\nThe point is that kids are different. A physical attention getter followed by an explanation of what they did wrong works better than modern methods on 9/10 kids. The physical smack sets a point in their mind and relates it to their action and afterwards they learned why they got smacked and why their behavior is wrong. It's much more involved than that but it's a simple enough explanation. It's not for the first time a child does something but after a few warnings it will help. That physical reminder makes their long term memory much more likely to store it and recall it before they do the same behavior again. \n\nI don't smack my kids because my wife said she didn't want us to. Honestly I think it's a huge mistake and will hurt them later on in life. I'd never hurt them but a short sharp physical pain that causes no injury shouldn't be considered child abuse. At least not when used to help correct bad behavior. Constantly smacking your child upside their head isn't what I'm talking about, that would be abusive. ","score":"86","subreddit":"funny"}

The vast majority of terrorists would not have committed terrorist acts if they were simply mentally ill, but they did so because of the ideological influence of radical Islam.\n\nEdit: Lol being downvoted for saying terrorism is real.

I really give you the benefit of a doubt and I don't assume you wanted to come across as demeaning but how exactly do you define \"being Muslim\". I know Reddit can be a gigantic circlejerk at times and especially in subs like /r/worldnews it is hard to talk objectively about religion but there is no clear definition of being Muslim. Just because someone has a religion - which can be lived in a wide spectrum of ways - doesn't mean he/she automatically acts in a certain way. \n\nThere are Muslims who are born in western societies and basically believe in God/Allah and that's it. Without asking them about their religion you would never assume that they are Muslim. I once had a girl have a massive nervous breakdown when she saw my passport with my religion in it. After that her whole view changed and I ultimately had to cut contact with her because it was just so annoying to apologize for every action a Muslim did on the news. I'm not their spokesperson and that's why you get downvoted. There are \"Indian looking Muslims\" who touch your arm without having sexual intentions. They just want to show their gratitude. \n\nEdit: This comment was written as an explanation for the downvotes at the time. She was at -7 when I responded to her. I just wanted to point out the overgeneralization of \"probably not Muslim\" and that it basically disregards the fact that there are various groups of Muslims around the world. From liberal one can be (aka \"westernized\") to radical. So describing all these people with \"Muslim\" and categorizing them is sometimes hurtful to the ones just wishing to live their life in peace as part of a civilized society. \n","score":"17","subreddit":"bestof"}

{"body":"I served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco and stayed for a few more years working with a non-profit. Morocco is over 99% Muslim, and Islam is the state religion. \n\nThe people there welcomed me with open arms. In my town, I could not leave the house without people inviting me in for tea, bread with jam, dates, or a full meal. Sometimes people would literally drag me into their homes to show hospitality. Why? They saw I was a foreign woman and the way that they lived their faith was to be welcoming and hospitable. Their act of inviting me in, of feeding me, of showing me love, of truly accepting me as I was, for who I was? To them, it was literally an act of worship. \n\nI have dozens of stories-- the time I lost my wristlet (with money, passport, phone, etc.) and when I called the phone, the taxi driver who found it drove it out to where I was, took me to where he found the wristlet, then offered to drive me anywhere I wanted. He asked for nothing in return. \n\nOr the time that I stopped in a small village on a long-distance bus, and an old man grabbed my hand, intertwined his fingers with mine, and said \"Morocco and the U.S. are like brothers. We are close. Like this. You are like our family.\" \n\nThe way I was adopted into certain families. The way that my neighbors who had so little resources that they didn't have a bathroom in their house still sent their daughter over with a pot of tea and stuffed bread when I came back from traveling... they knew I probably was tired and wanted to rest, but wanted to be sure I was taken care of without having to prep food and cook. \n\nI moved to Rabat-- the capital-- after Peace Corps. While there, I met the man who is now my husband. A Muslim, Moroccan, wonderful man. He is the opposite of what many think a \"Muslim man\" must be like. We respect each other. He treats me like an equal partner in everything. We laugh together every day, and after five years of marriage, I am more and more in love with him. \n\nHe teaches me to be a better person. When we first got married, he showed me that settling disagreements with raised voices and hurtful words isn't how you treat a loved one. He helped me settle down with my temper. And even now, if he sees it starting to flare, he'll de-escalate me with a joke or by making light of the situation. He helps me remember what is important in life-- people, actions, simple things... not a good job, having a good image, or impressing others. \n\nMy heart is breaking. I am calling, I am writing, I am marching. But my heart is breaking. He came halfway across the world to be with me, and now, my country is such the opposite of the hospitality, love, acceptance, and welcome that I received in Morocco. It's a terrible juxtaposition, and I hope we can stand up, speak out, and make change. ","score":"2873","subreddit":"blog"}

These values, which are set out in Article I-2, are common to the Member States. Moreover, the societies of the Member States are characterised by pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men. These values play an important role, especially in two specific cases. Firstly, under the procedure for accession set out in Article I-58, any European State wishing to become a member of the Union must respect these values in order to be considered eligible for admission. Secondly, failure by a Member State to respect these values may lead to the suspension of that Member State's rights deriving from membership of the Union (Article I-59).\n\n\u0026gt; In comparison with the existing Treaties, the Constitution has included new values, notably human dignity, equality, the rights of minorities and the characterization of the values upheld by the societies of the Member States.\n\nhttp://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/objectives_en.htm#VALUES\n\nWhat is realistically meant here with the term values is more likely addressed in the first chapter of the EU founding principles. \n\n\u0026gt; ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNION\n\n\u0026gt;In Article I-1, the Constitution established the European Union, reflecting the will of the citizens and States of Europe to build a common future. The Member States confer competences on the Union to attain objectives they have in common, and the Union coordinates the policies by which the Member States aim to achieve these objectives, and exercises on a Community basis the competences conferred on it by the Constitution.\n\n\u0026gt;The formula used in Article 1 is constitutional in nature, since it is stated that \"the Constitution establishes the European Union\", whereas in the existing Treaties it is the \"High Contracting Parties\" that establish the Union and the Community among themselves.

{"body":"Oops, I wrote this without looking. The images were taken with HiRISE, not MSL. So the reasoning is a bit different:\n\nHiRISE takes pictures using arrays of CCD sensors, but the sensors only take pictures of specific bands of color (blue-green, red, and near-IR). This is due to the initial main purpose of the satellite: find ideal landing locations. So, to create a color image, you have to either stack images from blue-green and red, or try and color correct from them. Some of the other issues, like the ones I mentioned below about command delay are also relevant, but since HiRISE doesn't have filters, that part isn't as important in this case. A bigger issue is being able to capture both bands while passing over the same area (unless they are imaging in stereo and have each camera capturing different bands, which I'm not even sure they can do, then they would have to correct alignment of the picture, and anything with dimension would look off or blurry)\n\n-----------\nMy original reply:\n\n\nThere are a few possibilities as to what correction would be/were made. The one that would apply to every picture (taken by the mast cam) would be for the Bayer pattern: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter\n\nAdditional things to keep in mind is that these images are often captured by accident. There is a 20 minute delay of any command sent, plus the delay before any picture could be received, so unless the scientist using the river that day knew ahead of time there was something that was going to happen, it is unlikely they could have planned for this.\n\nWith that in mind, the mastcam  has a few different filters that could be used when the picture was taken, depending on what the goal of a particular experiment may be, so the picture could have been taken in singular (R/G/B), monochrome, IR filtered, UV filtered, etc. Additionally, if no filter was used, the picture would have to be corrected for IR and UV, since they distort color a fair amount (I believe IR is a bigger concern, if I recall) ","score":"17","subreddit":"space"}
{"body":"The great tragedy of the past 50-odd years is that entire generations of people were made to stop dreaming. The Apollo program, in particular the Apollo 11 lunar landing, motivated an entire generation of children to become engineers and scientists.

Sure, science can be done in that environment, but the exploration of space entails going further than ever before and pushing the frontier. For decades we have played it safe, we have shied away from the next logical step in our journey: the planets.\n\nIf we decide today that we're going to Mars, and we're going soon, it would happen.

{"body":"I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this... I love AR15s, I love firearms, yadda yadda yadda. I'm a huge fan of guns in general. \n\nBut I'm assuming he finds it repulsive because having something that says \"war machine\" on a gun sling, especially on an ar15.. In my mind, it just reinforces the whole perspective that anti-gun people have of some gun owners. That we're all wanna-be operators and we're children who like playing around with \"war toys\". Personally, I wouldn't buy a sling with a patch that says that. Not because I care what anyone else thinks, but because I'm not trying to play GI Joe dress up. \n\nAlso, in the INCREDIBLY slim chance that you ever have to actually use your firearm in an act of self defense, having that patch on your sling would be some pretty strong ammo for prosecutors. It's my opinion that while a mature gun owner may acknowledge that he may at some point have to use his firearm in self defense, he will hopefully be well prepared for such an event, but he also recognizes that taking someone's life should be an absolute last resort. A mature gun owner should never WANT to take someone's life. A mature gun owner should never want to be put into a situation where he ever has to actually draw his firearm. Having a patch like this almost screams that you're basically itching to use it in an act of violence. At least that's how the anti gun community would see it, and that's how prosecutors would try and sell it. Argue with me all you want, but that's the world we live in. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't go so far as to judge someone like that for using this sling, but the argument could be made. Especially in the court of law. I am a firm supporter of the 2a. I think it's there for more than just hunting and target plinking. But if I wanted to use my AR as a weapon of war, I would've joined the marines. \n\nI respect life, I love firearms, but in all honesty I think the whole couch operator image does more harm than good to the community.

The Congressional resolution would mean precisely zilch, and does not represent US policy.\n\n2) The President doesn't \"veto\" the resolution. He signs a waiver deferring the moving of the embassy every 6 months, by choice. Even if he chose not to, it would likely be struck down as unconstitutional to try and force him to make the move, based on separation of powers. Indeed, that's what [the Justice Department OLC decided](https://www.justice.gov/olc/s770.16.htm) back in 1995. No President wants to deal with the public relations of it, so they sign a low-key waiver to avoid it.\n\n3) You didn't actually explain how an embassy in **uncontested West Jerusalem** somehow \"recognizes annexation\".\n\n\u0026gt; It isn't an assumption. It's the position of both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority\n\nNeither of which determine US policy or what it means.

The story also feels, to me at least, the Gaiman was being forced by DC to include stuff in the story that he'd rather not have (stuff like the Justice League and the cameo by Scarecrow).\n\nOddly enough the big one for me is probably Lucifer. When I first started reading it, it seemed like Carey was just trying to rehash what Gaiman did with Sandman. Then a little ways in I realize it's a completely different concept. Sandman is an epic godlike character that has to deal with the minutiae of everyday life like losing girlfriends and coming to terms with his own mortality. Lucifer is an epic godlike character inside of an epic fit for a god. At that point I figured it for cool escapist fiction I really liked. It wasn't until the last issue that I realized just how deep the entire work was. \n\nHitman was another one for me. It definitely got better the longer it went, but the early issues were still good. However I really didn't care for the first appearances of the character in The Demon, and although I know Garth Ennis wrote both, the quality difference really makes it seem like the two books were done by different writers.

It's *safe* I guess, but if you're cycling at 20mph it's horrible because you're stopping and starting for every exit, which is tiring when you can just cycle around the roundabout. So kids and slower adults use the slow route and faster adults use the roundabout. And that's fine too.\n\nI get why people think like this, and in a few rare cases there are indeed better options for bikes that people just don't know about. I can cycle three miles to the shops now, using just a few hundred metres shared with cars, which is brilliant compared to the past. But the routes aren't obvious and I only found them after buying a map with cycle routes marked on it.","score":"32","subreddit":"unitedkingdom"}

Could it be external pressure from a family member or friend? Similarly, I think you need to have him understand why it's important for you to maintain your own identity and not just assume his. Yes, you're forming your own family unit and becoming a team. But you're not just joining his family, he's joining yours. Hyphenation seems like the obvious compromise here, and it's concerning that he's no longer willing to entertain that as an option. If I were you (and I'm not, so take this advice with a grain of salt), I wouldn't back down on this. Yes, some things are give and take. If my FH really wants blue linens and I want white, I'll agree to blue because in the long run- whatever. But this is your identity and because of all the archaic symbolism of women as property in marriage, I would consider his stubbornness representative of deeper issues of respect.

There wasn't an instant gratification digital market where you can return the game if it doesn't meet your expectations. \n\nI grew up in that era. It sucked. Badly. You'd save up and ride your bike to the corner store and decide which game you'd like to try out and if it sucked, you were out the money and your time for the weekend. There was hardly any researching a game in the Atari days. \n\nAnd the protection against bad games didn't improve with Nintendo. The quality seal only meant the game would power on in your Nintendo and not crash it. These games were not free of bad bugs. Or horrible game play. And even THE magazine at the time to get information from, Nintendo Power, wouldn't ever say anything horribly damaging about games in their previews and reviews, despite games like Rambo or Fester's Quest, just to name a few. \n\nThe crash won't happen again. The industry won't allow it unless we have an economic crash and then it's just a byproduct of that, not just the industry crashing. By I meant it won't allow it, the infrastructure won't allow it.

They could have fulfilled the kickstarter with a small cheap game and pocketed the extra millions. \n\nIn the end, they were able to bring more employees in on the project, make it better through more content, orchestral soundtrack, better voice acting, etc. This cost nothing extra to the backers or anyone who bough the two parts. The game made money on top of that. So, basically every part of it was a success. \n\nThe only thing \"that cost them dearly and soured everyone's view of the game and the company\" was the work of a certain segment of the gaming community that hates Tim Schafer and distorted everything about the project. \n\nDouble Fine's big mistake was the badly handled Early Access for DF-9 which promised more than they could have ever delivered; pretty much the fate of any game that tries to replicate elements of Dwarf Fortress.

{"body":"Can't speak for Premier League players, but I've watched a friend who plays League 1 go through rehab from a pretty bad leg injury (break) and it's clear as day why these players lose pace (and why so many get injured in the first place). \n\nSprint speed is determined by stride frequency and stride length. In under 12s, the kid with the fastest stride frequency (takes the most steps) is generally the quickest. When you get to adults it's the athlete who has the longest stride length (without over-striding). This is why Usain Bolt can destroy runners with far faster legs (he finishes 100ms in 41 strides vs 45). Frequency is pretty set once you hit puberty (because it's a result of your central nervous system), but stride length can be drastically improved in anyone because it comes down to relative body strength and flexibility / mobility. I.e. strength + mobility = speed.\n\nWhen they start bringing players back, from what I've seen, they spend far more time getting the player to do more cardiovascular / aerobic capacity work (i.e. building up fitness) than they do building up mobility / flexibility and strength, largely because they're rushing to get them back into the game. They don't neglect the mobility \u0026amp; strength work completely, but it takes a back-seat to the slow-twitch cardio. So what tends to happen is the athlete comes back weaker and less mobile which equals less speed. In order to get that strength back players need to incorporate more strength training which is hard to recover from - particularly mid season. In younger players it's not so much of a problem, but as you get older it gets harder and harder to recover from the training required to get that speed and mobility back.\n\n","score":"25","subreddit":"soccer"}

Dahl was surprised to find that he would not receive any specialised training in aerial combat, or in flying Gladiators. On 19 September 1940, Dahl was ordered to fly his Gladiator from Abu Sueir in Egypt, on to Amiriya to refuel, and again to Fouka in Libya for a second refuelling. From there he would fly to 80 Squadron's forward airstrip 30 miles (48 km) south of Mersa Matruh. On the final leg, he could not find the airstrip and, running low on fuel and with night approaching, he was forced to attempt a landing in the desert. The undercarriage hit a boulder and the aircraft crashed, fracturing his skull, smashing his nose and temporarily blinding him. He managed to drag himself away from the blazing wreckage and passed out. He wrote about the crash in his first published work.\n\n","score":"45","subreddit":"hockey"}

{"body":"Welcome to WRC! I've only started watching since the beginning of last year but its regularly pretty exciting stuff, even with the Ogier domination. \n\nThe Monte Carlo Rally is a tarmac rally, but since its winter there will also be patches of snow. The spectators also sometimes play a part, some of them chucking snow onto the road on certain stages which adds a bit of spice and unpredictability. There's also a fair bit of strategy involved with the tire strategies, and teams are allowed to \"mix\" tyres Williams style. \n\nThe rally involves around 20 stages, some of them as long as 50km, yet the final time gaps are often within a minute. \n\nThis year is a great time to start watching (and for previous fans, a great time to return to rallying) with the new regulations which should make the cars faster, just like in F1, and there's the entry of Toyota.\n\nAt the same time, a very dominant VW pulled out because of Dieselgate despite winning the 2016 WCC. Its like if Mercedes withdrew from F1 after winning 3 straight WCC's, you know the championship is going to be close.  \n\nTeams and drivers to look out for: \n\n- Citroen: They took a year off last year to develop their car, only entering in certain rallies. Yet they still managed to win two rallies, Portugal and Finland with their main driver Kris Meeke. Meeke is really quick, but he's that type of driver that either does very well or DNF's in a crash by pushing too hard, so I'm not entirely sure if he'd be able to be WDC. \n\n- Hyundai: fairly good car capable of victories, with their drivers Thierry Neuville and Hayden Paddon getting victories in 2016and Sordo getting two 2nd places. Neuville actually finished 2nd in the driver's championship ahead of two of the three Volkswagen drivers, so he's pretty good, and Paddon and Sordo is consistently in the top 5. \n\n- Ford M-Sport: they're not actually the \"factory\" Ford team, but M-Sport is a bit like a team like Williams or Force India, they just chose to run the Ford ~~Focus~~ Fiesta cars. This year they've got the reigning World Champion Sebastien Ogier who was WDC with VW last year, who is extremely good at Monte Carlo and unbelievably quick compared to anyone else. The M-sport car is a bit slower than the two teams above but driver skill plays a big factor so its still his championship to lose. His team mates are Ott Tanak and Elfyn Evans, who are both solid drivers who can contend for a win on their day. \n\n- Toyota: Returning to WRC after over 10 years absence, they're a new team so their car might not be as good. They have rally legend Tommi Makkinen as team principal and an all Finnish driver lineup with Jari- Matti Latvala and Juho Hanninen. Latvala was a VW driver last year and can be extremely quick on his day, but he struggled with confidence in 2016 and was nowhere near Ogier's level. \n\n","score":"17","subreddit":"formula1"}

A soldier saluting as Miranda Keys and company pass, then staring at the Arbiter and giving his friend a sidelong glance as if to say \"can you believe this guy?\" The famous \"Ooh-rah\" after Johnson's \"Regret\" line in Halo 2. All of the random things marines would do and say during gameplay that made you laugh or say \"I'm right there with ya, pal.\" Seeing the flood through a normal soldier's eyes first. The list goes on.   \n    \nI could easily see myself living in the rural houses of Winter Contingency. They feel like real, lived-in spaces. You can imagine the lifestyle and daily routine of their inhabitants just by looking around. For example, everyone shares the same pottery because it's all made locally by a neighbor with a potter's workshop. You meet a farmer and his family is hiding, terrified of the monsters that tore through their property, but peaking their head out to catch a glimpse of these walking tanks on their doorstep. You walk through empty homes, getting a feel for the lives and families they once held. Then you start seeing bodies. Some huddled together, some embracing, some caught crawling for the doorway. (Think about this: everyone you meet in Halo Reach most likely dies in the end. Every random army trooper you fight alongside, every ODST and ship captain you hear over the radio, every civilian. Next to nobody makes it off that planet and the gorgeous landscapes you see in the beginning are all ash and glass.)  \n  \nThe missions set on Meridian tried to do this. Add that Human touch. In some ways, it worked, but for the most part everyone on Meridian felt like set dressing. I can't quite explain why. Maybe it's because after you put all this effort into saving people on the elevator, they just disappear. You don't see their bodies in the wreckage, you don't feel the impact and the loss. Osiris, if I remember correctly, more or less cracks a joke and moves on.  \n  \nThe dialog that tries to be relatable in 5 simply falls flat or feels forced. \"You aren't the only one who's here because of him.\" Jokes about buying everyone a round of beer when they get back.

You purposely lied, repeatedly by the sound of it. And your \"personal private thoughts\" are supposed to be *personal*, *private*, **thoughts** that you don't share with other people. Especially people like your ex-wife!! \n\nHere's some advice on being a better partner: act as if your gf is standing next to you at all times. Seriously. Don't say or do anything that you wouldn't say/do if she were right in front of you. Obviously there are exceptions but insulting her to your ex-wife is not one of them. \n\n\u0026gt; I'd like to be more secure, understand how something will be viewed from another's perspective rather than just my own\n\nHave you tried simply switching the roles and thinking about it as if you were her? How would you feel if you found out she was insulting you to an ex-boyfriend whom she had specifically told you she only sent memes to? What if you also had a long history of betrayal in relationships?\n\n\u0026gt; Is any contact with my ex-wife appropriate? \n\nWhy, specifically, do you want to remain friends? What does she offer you that other friendships don't offer? I think it's okay to stay friends with exes but \n\n1) You should never lie about the nature of the relationship to your current SO. If you have to lie about something, you probably shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\n\n2) You should definitely never say anything negative about your current SO to an ex. That is massively inappropriate and again, if you wouldn't say it right in front of your gf, don't say it behind her back.\n\n3) I agree that it was inappropriate to text her before you text your gf in the morning (unless that was only a one-time thing). It doesn't matter how meaningless the messages were. Why was it important to contact her at all? How would you feel if your gf was messaging her ex every morning before she even talked to you?\n\n\u0026gt; How can I vent in a healthy manner, without disrespecting my partner or needing to rely on others as sounding boards\n\nIf you have issues with the relationship, you should bring them up with your partner. If you have a close **platonic** friend (NOT someone that you have sexual and emotional history with), you could occasionally vent to them. And insults towards your partner are never appropriate. You could say \"it really frustrates me how easily she breaks up with me when she's stressed, it's like she doesn't value our relationship enough to stick it out\". Calling her a crazy homeless person is not venting, it's just disrespectful and rude no matter who you're talking to. \n\nYou could also try writing in a journal if you truly just need to vent and don't want any response in return. \n\nGood luck. Having the self-awareness to recognize your own faults is  important and it's good that you want to improve in general and not just to win her back.

You've likely been all she's known, romance-wise, and I wouldn't be surprised if she resents you to an extent because of how your relationship made her grow up too quickly. \n\nThis has all the signs of turning nasty (if it's not already). Your goal should be to do what's best for your kids. If that means ending things because she cannot or will not commit to the family, then that might just be the way it goes.

An escort, we call it. It can be your boyfriend, your brother, hell I've brought my best friend with me. Bring your makeup artist or your hair stylist. If you do your HMU yourself, bring a friend to \"touch it up\" throughout the shoot. Even if it's not the most bouncer-esque person you know, having another person there with you protects you and buffers you. \n\nDoing this does not \"kill vibes.\" Doing this is normal and professional and correct, and anyone who tells you otherwise has ulterior motives. 100% of the time. I promise. \n\nI don't know what to tell you about the \"is this a scam\" part of the problem. Of course it's a scam. A really dangerous one, at that.

Since it didn't make it to the 100 manga volumes sales of the year, which cuts out at [~400,000 copies](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-11-30/top-selling-manga-in-japan-by-volume-2016/.109353), the total sales are somewhere between that range.\n\nSame with Vagabond.

Here's the quote:\n\n\u0026gt;  I did a keyword dig yesterday and after pruning it around I found more than 20,000 buyer intent keywords that would be viable, if I had the time and resources to work with them. I'd recommend using a combination of SEMrush and KWfinder to find 20 or so domains in your space and filter out their money terms by using keyword and volume filters \"best, reviews, top, cheap\" ect.\n\nJust wondering could you expand on this? I'm at a point where I'm looking for more viable kw's to target but I don't understand your method.\n\nTo me it sounds like this:\n\n* find related domains\n* punch domains into SEMRush and sort posts by volume/buyer kws\n* Snag the buyer intent kws and make better content\n\nThis seems easy enough but where does KWFinder come into play? You said you found **more than** 20k buyer intent keywords with this method. That's effin crazy! I'd love to understand how you did that. \n\nBTW congrats on all your success you're a big inspiration for anyone getting into the affiliate game.","score":"28","subreddit":"Entrepreneur"}

{"body":"Finally!  I've been waiting for this.  I have a different kind of photo to share with you guys, so save your upvotes for the other runners displaying their achievements and pretty sights.  But first, a lengthy background story.\n\nAbout a year ago I inquired about my step-dad starting to do running photography.  I'm arguably his biggest fan because he always takes such great race photos of me, either looking like a bad ass or a dumb ass, but the photo is clear and scenic regardless.  He started capturing other runners who would pose for photos as they ran by, and they asked to buy them.  We didn't know the legalities of all of this since he was just a hobby photographer shooting strangers on a race course with their own photographers. \n\nAfter a lot of positive and negative attention, he's finally a photographer for our local running collective.  Contracts were already signed when it came to start and finish photos, but he was given the honour of being the course photographer.  He drives to various spots on the race course and catches everyone in action.  My favourite photos are when he wears his camouflage suits and hides in the brush.  No poses, no running for the camera.  Just real, raw running photos.  They're wonderful.  He's really found his niche with running photography.\n\nAnyway, on Sunday he joined me for the 10-miler, one of the premiere races the collective is trying to advertise and grow.  You may remember I mentioned in my race report that I jogged by his car stuck in the mud and saw him frantically trying to get someone on the phone to come and help him so he could drive to the next spot and catch more runners.\n\n[This is my favourite photo](http://imgur.com/bNQLp5g.jpg) from that spot.  He made the runners in the photo very happy with such a fun shot, and once he cropped out his car, it made a nice advertising photo for the race as well.  To me, at least, it showed that 10-milers can be fun on their own without gimmicks or obstacles.  \n\nTo put it into perspective how much our race photos have improved since he started doing course photography, [here's](http://imgur.com/560uwhy.jpg) what our race photos used to look like.  Slap a $10 price tag on that for a 4x6 print and you're looking at a lot of disappointed runners.  [Another](http://imgur.com/MImgmVl.jpg) from the usual photographer, one of the better ones without the ... unique... editing.\n\nI'm so happy for him, and very proud as well.  Through all of this, my little family has made our impression on the local running scene.  Everyone knows my step-dad, and everyone knows me either for my fun run outfits, enthusiastic volunteering, shoe launching at finish lines, or as his step-daughter.\n\n[Here's my photo](http://imgur.com/MjEP9lB.jpg) from that day, as well as [my finishing photo](http://imgur.com/cdLqO9G.jpg) where you can clearly see from the angry expression on my face that I was preparing to kick off that stupid shoe.\n\n/end bragging about awesome step-dad","score":"30","subreddit":"running"}

{"body":"So, no one is really explaining any of this, just giving definitions. \n\nLet's start with RAIM.\nThink of a GPS satellite as a really precise clock. It sends out a signal telling you what time it is. If you know where the GPS satellite is (ephemeris data) you can tell how far you are from the satellite by comparing the current time to the time you just received from the satellite. The difference in those two times is the amount of time it took the signal to travel from the GPS satellite to your location at the speed of light. Do a little distance = speed * time math to get the distance. This tells you only how far away from a satellite you are. This means that you can now locate yourself, with respect to the satellite, on a sphere surrounding that satellite at the distance you calculated. If you do the same math for a second satellite, you know your position is at the intersection of the sphere around the first satellite and the sphere around the second satellite. Incidentally, that intersection is a circle. If you add a third satellite it will narrow it down to (almost always) two points on the circle between the first two satellites, and a fourth satellite will allow you to narrow it down to a single point. \n\n\nNow for RAIM. With 4 satellites we know our position, but what if something is wrong with one of the distances we calculated? How would we know? Well, if we add a 5th satellite, we can check our position by seeing if the addition of a 5th distance agrees with the other 4. If it does, great! If not, RAIM warning! If you have a 6th satellite, you can iterate through several 5 satellite solutions (excluding 1 at a time). If you have a problem satellite then 5 of the 6 solutions will agree, and 1 will disagree. The receiver will then temporarily blacklist the information from the bad satellite, and continue to monitor the 5 satellite solution for integrity.\n\nRecap:\n\n1 satellite: you know you are on a sphere with a known radius surrounding the satellite\n\n2 satellites: you know you are on a circle between two satellites\n\n3 satellites: you know you're on one of two points on the previous circle\n\n4 satellites: you know where you are.\n\n5 satellites: you can tell if you're getting bad information from one of the satellites\n\n6 satellites: you can safely exclude bad information from the solution and monitor the other 5 for problems\n\n\n\nWAAS: GPS is used to figure out our location on or near the Earth's surface. If we very precisely survey a location, and determine its exact location ahead of time, we can monitor a GPS receiver at that location to learn how inaccurate the information it is providing us with is (error = actual position - GPS positon). The GPS solution relies on the satellite knowing exactly what time it is, the receiver knowing the position of the GPS satellite at a specific point in time as well as the path the signal takes from the satellite to the surface. If there are errors or changes to any of these parameters, the position solution might be wrong. To correct for that, a separate signal is broadcast with the information necessary to remove these errors. That signal is WAAS. The method by which this is done is really really REALLY complex, and actually requires us to understand things as esoteric as the relativistic effects of the satellite's motion relative to the surface and the fact that the signal is moving deeper into Earth's gravity well as it goes from satellite to surface. Suffice it to say, \"WAAS tells you all the little mistakes the GPS system is making so you can account for them.\"\n","score":"24","subreddit":"flying"}

{"body":"You recalled correctly. Apples are referred to as \"obligate out-crossers\", meaning they have to cross-pollinate with a different variety to successfully set fruit at all. The apple produced is dependent on the mother tree, but each seed inside will be a unique hybrid. To be productive, an orchard must always have at least two apple varieties in it, which are chosen to be compatible pollen-wise for setting fruit, and which also bloom at the same time, so the bees can deliver the pollen between the trees when they are both in bloom. It's also significant to know that apple trees are grafted onto specialized root stock, usually chosen to create a healthy, short (=easier to pick), and faster to bear fruit tree. So, almost every apple tree you see is a double clone - one clone for the stem, and one for the roots.\n\nFun fact: Johnny Appleseed was a real person, and was the originator of many varieties of apples. What was he doing, planting whole orchards full of apple seeds, when he knew no two trees would be alike, and many not worth eating? The answer is, he was planting for cider, not for eating. If you are growing for cider, it makes sense to have variation: even tart, inedible varieties will produce a flavorful cider, and a mix is better than a single variety. The trees will also bear their fruit at different times, allowing you to spread out your cider production. A mixed orchard is more resilient to weather variation too: trees that don't bear much fruit one season may produce lots the next. \n\nJohnny kept moving on, but the people who got his orchards had hundreds of newly created varieties to choose from. The healthiest, most productive, and tastiest varieties got chosen to be cloned into more trees. Also, sometimes a branch on a tree will mutate and start bearing a slightly different apple, and those are sometimes superior and chosen to be cloned as well.","score":"16","subreddit":"askscience"}

Say the 49ers were contracted to pay him 5 million per year for 3 years totalling 15 million. \n\n\nChip will make 5 million dollars next year even if he were unemployed. Let's assume that Cal wants to hire him and is going to pay him 1 million dollars per year on a 2 year contract. Chip Kelly for the next two years will make 5 million dollars per year. 4 million of that would come from the 49ers and 1 million of that would come from Cal. He doesn't get to double dip. There is literally no incentive for him bargaining for a higher salary from Cal. All he would be doing would be saving the 49ers money. (If he were to bargain for a 2 million dollar salary from Cal, 49ers would be responsible for only 3 million of his buyout)\n\n\nLook at Charlie Strong's South Florida contract for a real world example.

{"body":"The other problem is that I think the importance of the coach is quite  a bit reduced in the NFL. In College you're literally shaping player development. Most players get to the NFL close to fully formed, and it's not really the HC's job to get them the rest of the way there. The marginal impact of an HC on an NFL team is quite a bit less then in college.\n\nThe second part is that while the buck stops with the HC in college on performance and recruiting, the team is largely the jurisdiction of the GM in the NFL, not the HC. \n\nThen there's the fact that you're competing against 31 other teams for a title instead of 127 this year. Even if you're just counting P5 as viable title contenders, that's still 64 other teams. On top of that, losing just 2 games in a season means it's almost impossible to win a title, whereas an NFL team can lose 7 and make and win the playoffs. \n\nThe very worst NFL team, the Cleveland Browns, had [200:1 Odds](http://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nfl-main/?y=2016\u0026amp;sa=nfl\u0026amp;a=sb\u0026amp;p=pre\u0026amp;o=r) of winning the Super Bowl at the start of the season.

Winston wasn't as efficient as Prescott, but once again, he was working behind a far inferior O-Line with a revolving door of RBs due to injury, an atrocious receiving corps outside of Mike Evans, against one of the toughest schedules in the NFL. Despite all that, he still nearly led the Bucs to a playoff berth. \n\nI'm not trying to discredit Dak because he did play remarkably well considering that he was a rookie and I could definitely see him being among the next wave of top QBs, but given his supporting cast, most starting QBs could look pretty damn good. I mean, he was behind the best offensive line in football, had a potential OPOY candidate running the ball in Zeke, and was throwing to a receiving corps that includes a top 5-10 WR in Dez and a future HoF TE that is possibly the best 3rd down target in the league.

Every month or two, there would be a local news item about a new building project discovering human remains/ historical artifacts/ weird shit when excavating a new building. They even found a [freaking 18th century wooden ship](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/World-Trade-Center-Ship-Mystery-Philadelphia-Buried-Treasure-Colonial-Era-269245151.html) while completing excavations for the new WTC. \n\nYou have to understand that NYC has been *extremely* highly populated for centuries, with generations living quite literally on top of one another. \n\nBut more importantly, most of the \"land\" in coastal areas was largely man-made by layering garbage with dirt. Garbage that contains hundred of years of human trash. Even when this wasn't done to expand the coastline (as was the case in lower Manhattan in particular), it was used to fortify the foundations of large scale city building projects, especially near the coasts where the land is swampy. \n\nMy point is that even if LaGuardia were torn down (a personal fantasy - I hate that place) and full scale excavation was undertaken, there would probably be centuries of human remains and weird shit to find, all mixed together.

There will quite a few more times in standard where the card is completely dead, or very low impact.  That said, it's still good in the format, just not nearly to the same degree.  Equally, something like [[Renegade Rallier]], while certainly good in Standard becomes the lynchpin to entire deckstyles in Modern, due to the presence of Fetches in the format coupled with a larger cardpool to draw from, which makes it just a value target in Standard, with some minor synergies more than it is a strong synergy/combo piece.  \n\nThis isn't to say anything bad about the cards themselves in the format; I feel Fatal Push is going to be quite prominent in the years to come, although perhaps not nearly as much as in Modern.  \n\nI will say that I want to echo that the set is very much a step in the right direction.  It's unfortunately marred down by the ridiculous crap they printed BFZ and Shadows, so I'll say I'm cautiously optimistic.  The big problems with the format still remain, and I'm uncertain whether these fundamentally good cards and synergies can compete against what is ostensibly fundamentally broken decks.  \n\nI have the unnerving feeling that Kaladesh block, and everything it did right, is going to get lost in the sea of Emrakuls, Spell Quellers, Gideons, Copters, and Avacyns.

Very few locals in DC would want to attend which limits the total crowd for obvious reasons, as it was limited to travelers taking a day off from work.

{"body":"Hi there,\n\nI had an exchange year in Ohio after my 10th year of schooling in Sweden - meaning I ended up somewhere in between junior/senior since our school systems are a bit different (also since I was a fes). My impression is that the school system in the US is way easier, most of my exams were multiple choice with maybe one \"essay\" question. In Sweden multiple choice is quite rare. The essay question was usually just 2-4 sentences and quite easy, often a re-worded question that we had previously seen in class. An essay question in Sweden would be 1-4 pages, depending on the subject and question. More focus is put on how reflection and critical thinking, there are less \"what\"-questions and more \"why\"- and \"how\"-questions if that makes sense. An example would be comparing social studies - in the US I had to take an \"American Government\" class with most of the focus being the constitution, just memorizing the contents in it, when the different amendments were added and whatnot. Back home for \"Swedish Government\" the class was divided and we got to represent one of the major parties (7 at the time) and read up on their policies on some selected issues, and then we had a debate amongst the students which was 50% of our grade for that course of something. We rarely had actual discussions about different policies in the US, it was more \"remember what the teacher says\". \n\nI also recall a lot of the homework being mandatory, and that if I didn't do it I could not achieve the highest grade at the end of that study period (9 weeks? can't remember). In Sweden a lot of the homework isn't something you turn in (especially in Gymnasium, which is where you'd end up) but rather you do it for your own good - personal responsibility and all that. Some of it gets turned in and graded of course, but in general my math teacher didn't give two shits if I didn't do the problems in the book. It's recommended of course, but some people just have an easier time with maths so if I did fine on the exams, that was it. Of course a part of your grade is still decided by classroom activity, though mainly for other subjects like social studies and history. \n\nAdding on to that, I was 17 when I left for the US but back in Sweden I was mostly treated as an adult, or at least a mature teenager. In the US, it didn't seem to matter my age - I felt like I was transported back to like 4th grade because that's how it felt with the rules and restrictions. I also felt like a lot of my peers were immature, which can probably be explained by the lack of personal freedom and responsibility for youth. Granted, I moved from Stockholm and had been using public transportation since a very young age and in rural Ohio I wasn't allowed to drive, so I was very limited when I wanted to do something. Turning 18 didn't really change anything, either. In general, I'd say Swedish Gymnasium is a bit closer to college, at least when it comes to personal freedom and what's expected of you. Obviously it varies by schools, I attended a pretty good one and my sister ended up a different one which seemed to have lower standards and expectations.\n\nI also don't know how many Gymnasiums that actually offer all of their classes in English, there are a few but the majority are just taught in Swedish. Unless you are gifted with languages this might be your biggest hurdle - though not impossible, since a girl from the HS I attended ended up going to a Swedish school for exchange after I left, with no prior classes taken in Swedish. She was clever though. \n\nI realize that this turned out quite long, but if you any specific questions just let me know and I'll try to answer. ","score":"30","subreddit":"sweden"}

SIV, the precursor to HIV found in non-human primates, has existed for thousands of years, possibly millions.\n\nFunny thing is, there are actually multiple strains of HIV, which are derived from different strains of SIV, which affect chimps, gorillas, and sooty mangabeys (a type of monkey). As in, one strain of SIV infects chimps, one infects gorillas, one infects mangabeys. This means that HIV crossed species multiple times, and something like the above happened with chimps, gorillas, and mangabeys something like 5 times in separate incidents. All around the same time, in the early 20th century, even though the parent viruses existed for millennia. It's an odd coincidence, possibly associated with increasing populations and the rise of large cities in Africa, or possibly caused by increased connectivity.

And you need a tripod to hold the camera perfectly still while the shutter is open, so that the picture doesn't come out blurry. And you need a flashlight.\n\nSo you set the camera up, set a long exposure time (30 secs is probably a good place to start), click the shutter, and walk around the truck shining the flashlight on various parts of the truck you want to highlight. Because it's all captured in a single frame, your picture will be the cumulative light shined on the truck over the course of the exposure.\n\nThere are lots of great things you can do with different light-emitting tools-- flashlights, lasers, glow-sticks, strobe lights, LED blinkers, fire...\n\nJust [google \"light painting\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=light+painting\u0026amp;source=lnms\u0026amp;tbm=isch\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG7bnNzb_RAhXGD8AKHQxbApgQ_AUICCgB\u0026amp;biw=1362\u0026amp;bih=772) to see all sorts of awesome effects people manage with this really, *really* simple technique.","score":"19","subreddit":"Trucks"}

On Thursday night I was walking towards the YD, past the theatre on the corner of Princess and Notre Dame around 5-6pm after work. As I walked by the movie theater, there was a group of 3-4 younger guys (20-30ish) in one of the small alcoves and they gave off such a weird/bad/sketchy vibe. \n\nSometimes there is maybe one person in one of these alcoves having a smoke, getting a break from the wind, or just standing there for whatever reason, but this felt so different to me. It didn't really make sense that a group of 3 or 4 would be standing there taking a break. It is not a warm place, there is no bus stop, it is not interesting, it is just a weird place to stand. \n\nIt can be startling to walk past someone who is standing there because you dont see them until you pass by and I was definitely startled by this group as I passed. I basically thought \"holy shit, why are 4 adult dudes huddled so close together, watching me walk by, it feels like they are waiting for something/someone, etc.\". As I passed I happened to be fiddling with my phone to call my GF to say I was on my way home. This is probably partially why I was surprised, because I was looking down, then, oh shit, 4 dudes out of nowhere. As I passed, one of the dudes started to leave his spot in the alcove and I could feel it, like that feeling when someone is right behind you, so i made sure to cross Princess/Notre dame immediately and pretended to talk on my phone (my GF hadnt actually answered). I then put my phone back in my pocket, I was about 100 meters away and I turned around to check these guys out, it was so weird, it really felt like they were waiting to rob/attack someone.\n\nI've walked past the movie theater everyday of the week for years and I've seen a lot of the downtown characters we all know exist.

{"body":"I think I can give a shot at telling more about this. Please correct me if I'm wrong or if you can add more to this:\n\nThe \"Krakensbane\" system came to life because of floating point precision. A float is stored as a 32-bit value and thus only has a fixed amount of digits it can store. You can still represent huge numbers with them (like in KSP it can represent distance between planets).\n\nThe way floats do that is by splitting the number into two parts. One part is the digits: lets say 1264365 and the other part is the place of the point. So now we can represent a small number with high precision: 1.2364365 or a big number with less precision: 1236436.5\n\nTo get this back into KSP terms. Let's say we work on the physics for KSP and need to see if your ship is being ripped apart or not by crashing it into you space station. We need to know the relative distance between the cockpit and the engine parts to know if the \"forces are too high\" and it should break. Let's say the threshold for breaking is 3 millimeters (sorry imperials). Soo if the engine and the cockpit are further apart from each other then 3 millimeters the connection should break.\n\nIf we are close to the origin (0,0,0) then we have a lot of precision to calculate this with floats: Let's say our floats represent kilometers. We are only 1 meter from the origin: 0.100000 We still have a lot of digits to calculate the difference in millimeters and even smaller. If we where 12000 kilometers from the origin we would have a problem. We lose precision: 120000.00 we can go up to precision in centimeters: 120000.01 but not any smaller.\n\nThis creates the problem for the physics engine because it doesn't know if the distance is bigger or smaller then 3 millimeters and comes with an estimation that might not be the real representation and rips our ship apart. \n\nNote that you can represent very small or very big numbers with floating points by using the same trick as scientific notation; 120000000000000 would become 12e13. We just lose precision.","score":"30","subreddit":"Unity3D"}

I took the bait. (Edit: I had childhood trauma, so I had \"bait\" practically written across my forehead). I came to the shop after hours (while clients were still there at the begining) to \"talk\" and learn about tattoo guns.. the people all left.. he locked the door and raped and tortured me for a few hours. I didn't want my mom to know, was all I could think, and I just went back the next day. And that went on for a year. He'd make me do things, then throw money at me.

He did the same things to her only honestly more so because she was more attractive to him. An old guy came in that he knew and he some how made the other girl go out on a long evening date with him. She was dressed up like she was going to prom, and she was paid for it. Her and I were paid to go to another guy's trailer and clean and massage him.. 50 bucks each for two tiny blonds. Anyway, there was an old woman who worked there that was a former dope addict and reformed prostitute.. her and I got close, and I told her what was happening. She talked him into letting me out. I was scared out of my mind, but I faked cool, and over a cheap diner dinner with him and her, I convinced him that I wanted to get a job and would come and help when I could. I bolted and never went back. He wound up leaving state. A lot of people knew what he was. People even asked me when I was there, but I was too fucked up and I'd lie for him.

{"body":"That’s a really great question! Student loans are definitely not something to be taken lightly so your teacher is giving you good advice. It is possible that your financial situation can help you obtain grants - when you fill out your [FAFSA] (https://studentloanhero.com/featured/do-you-have-to-fill-out-fafsa-every-year-answer/), you’ll find out all of the types of aid you’re eligible for (both loans and grants) and you can decide what you feel comfortable taking on.\n\nAs for the impact the debt might have on you, that will vary based on a lot of things: how much debt you end up taking on, whether you stick with federal loans or add private loans (which *should* be a last resort because they come at much higher interest rates and don’t come with [federal loan protections] (https://studentloanhero.com/featured/the-complete-list-of-student-loan-forgiveness-programs/)), and the work you’re able to obtain after you graduate. \n\nIf you find out that you’re not able to pay for your entire education with grants and scholarships, what you could do to minimize your debt impact is take out federal loans only and take on as little in loans as possible. Here are a few tips to help:\n\n1. Go to a school close to home so you can live with your parents (if they’ll allow it) and save money on dorms (this can greatly decrease the cost of college).\n\n2. If you prefer to go to a school out of town, see if any of your local universities offer a plan to help you get in-state tuition. For example, some universities will give in-state tuition to students who get an Associate’s degree at qualifying schools and then transfer into their Bachelor’s program.\n\n3. Work part-time during the school year and in the summer and start making payments on your loans while you’re still in school - you don’t have to wait until you graduate. This will give you a major head start on payoff. \n\nWhen you graduate and start working, there will also be many ways you can pay your loans off faster and ensure they don’t impact you for decades to come. Here are a few things you can do to [pay student loans faster] (https://studentloanhero.com/featured/ultimate-guide-paying-off-student-loans-faster/). \n\nI hope this helps!

{"body":"It's relevant because the culture in many schools treats girls and boys in math in fundamentally different ways to avoid accusations of sexism against girls.

If there was a scheduling conflict between a higher math course and a non-math course the student wanted, a male student would have been allowed to take the non-math class even with decent grades, but the female students only were if they were failing. This with the same grades and class ranks and similar test scores.\n\nThis push that \"women can do just as well at math as boys\" has made it almost stigmatized to talk about a woman who can't do math. But just as there are men who can't do math, there are women who can't do math, too. Educators who see evidence of problems in math education with a female child should be sure to compare the child both to other girls and the average or baseline for that age group to avoid accusations of sexism against girls.

Then he goes back to Winterfell, where he is expecting to catch hell from Cat, and she (insanely) decides to direct all her ire and hatred toward Jon instead of Ned.  \n\nAlso, how is keeping Cat in the dark unnecessary?  Cat freaks out about Ashara Dayne's name even being mentioned in Winterfell.  She's a possessive, jealous bitch, and an idiot.  If Cat found out that Jon was Ashara's son, she would have smothered him in his crib.  Having a bad relationship with your stepmom isn't exactly groundbreaking new territory.

Both of these things will cause an increase in dopamine release -- not of the euphoric variety, but restores fluid tonic dopamine release. It binds to the CB1 receptor and has no activity (hence is an antagonist), which is why it smooths out the effects of THC. It also blocks the breakdown of endogenous cannabinoids, which helps pain relief (alongside the opioid modulation). \n\nI think I remember that CBD also interacts with certain types of calcium channel which contributes to its anti-epileptic and anti-psychotic activity. \n\nCBD is freaking fantastic but the writer of that post should have made an effort to get terms and facts write.

{"body":"The building in the picture is Palazzo Braschi in Rome, the headquarters of the Fascist Party Federation (the local one, not the national Party headquarters). It was not always covered up like that; this set-up was displayed for the 1934 elections, in which Italians were called to vote either for or against the Fascist representatives list. The “SI SI…” lettering (meaning “Yes Yes…”) was propaganda for one of the two plebiscite elections held during the Fascist Regime, where electors didn’t vote for individual parties (there wasn’t any but the Fascist one), neither for single candidates, but just voted “Yes” or “No” to a single list of candidates presented by the Duce himself.\n\n\n \nThe voting procedure used two ballots and two envelopes; the yes ballot was in the colors of the Italian flag with fascist symbols, while the no ballot was a white sheet. The voter had to place the ballots in envelopes, put his chosen ballot in the ballot box and return the discarded one to the voting supervisors, de facto allowing them to check what each person had voted. The list put forward was ultimately approved by 99.84% of voters. The overwhelming majority provoked Benito Mussolini to dub the election the “second referendum of Fascism”.\n\nWhen Mussolini promised a new world order for Italy, he set out to give Rome a Fascist façade. In Rome, the capital of the “fascist empire”, Mussolini’s grand scheme was to transform the city with propagandistic buildings and urban stages whose look and feel would broadcast his achievements and objectives. (This was exactly what the Roman emperors and the popes of the Catholic church had done for centuries, of course; without the inflated egos of so many past rulers). Architects in the 1920s and ‘30s took their cues from the forms of classical Roman buildings, but whereas the enormous structures of imperial Rome have ornate details and rounded edges that give them a certain Mediterranean warmth, fascist buildings were Teutonic blocks of unrelieved travertine, which made them cold and forbidding.\n\nFrom: http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/headquarters-fascist-party-1934/\n\n","score":"826","subreddit":"creepy"}

No possible good can come from skipping it, and plenty of bad can. If there's no basis for a restraining order, one should not be granted, but the judge can only evaluate the cases actually presented. If you do not appear, the judge will hear only your ex-roommate's side of the story, and will likely uphold the order.\n\nWhich will then appear on background checks, may restrict your right to own guns, and will generally make police interactions with more painful in the future (even traffic stops). Plus, you run the risk of violating the order unintentionally and having to reappear to defend yourself against criminal charges.\n\nIf the officer did not witness any obvious signs of a domestic disturbance, and the only other witness is her mother, who was not present at the time, you have a good chance of having the order dismissed. Judges have seen people lie on the stand before, on a daily basis, and are unlikely to take your roommate's story entirely at face value if you are there to state, under oath, a version of events that's incompatible with hers. Seriously consider getting a lawyer (and shop around tomorrow, you have time to make some phone calls), as well.\n\nHowever, _let this drop_ once the restraining order is out of the way, and do move elsewhere as quickly as you reasonably can. A restraining order does not, on its own, invalidate your lease, and you can return home if the order is rescinded. Yes, your roommate has to go through the proper channels to evict you. Yes, a bad-faith police report is technically a crime, and you incurred some fairly serious inconvenience as a result.

At least as far as Saren goes.\n\n\u0026gt;Ash: This is the most advanced ship in the alliance navy. I don't think we should give them free reign to poke around the vital systems.\n\n\u0026gt;Shepard: You don't trust the alliance's allies?\n\n\u0026gt;Ash: I'm not sure I'd call the council races allies. We - humanity I mean - have to learn to rely on ourselves.\n\nThis is understandable, especially from a military person. Those three council races are powerful, technologically advanced, and have not been kind to humanity in the past. \n\n\u0026gt;Shepard: Standing up for ourselves doesn't mean standing alone.\n\n\u0026gt;Ash: I don't think we should turn down allies. I just think we shouldn't bet everything on them staying allies. As noble as the council members seem now, if their backs are against the wall, they'll abandon us.\n\nNote that she’s in favor of being allies with aliens. Again, not a very hateful or xenophobic trait. She just thinks that aliens won’t always reciprocate. We should note that the story itself supports her view. \n\n\u0026gt;You got a pessimistic view of the universe, Williams.\n\n\u0026gt;Ash: A pessimist is what an optimist calls a realist. Look, if you're fighting a bear, and the only way to survive is to sic your dog on it and run, you'll do it. As much as you love your dog, it isn't human. \n\nThis is the line that gets her branded a space-racist. People think she’s saying the other species are like domesticated animals and that we should ditch them if trouble comes. But no, what she’s saying is that **this is how they view us**. She’s saying, “If something bad happened, the council races would look out for themselves first and foremost, and treat us like their dog.” And note that she’s not even mad at them. She’s just saying we need to be able to stand up for ourselves in case they do abandon us. And keep in mind they have already done so: The council scoffed at the idea of protecting Eden Prime after the Geth attack. That was fine, inasmuch as the humans put themselves in danger when they pushed so far out into the Attican Traverse, but the point is that the council did what was politically expedient instead of what what best for humanity, thus proving Ashley right.\n\nGiven that Williams has family members that were killed or disgraced in the war we fought with the Turians (a war they started) I’d say her worldview strikes me as being incredibly open-minded given those circumstances. Very few people can get through a war and remain this calm and practical regarding their views of the other side.\n\nShe doesn’t hate them, or wish them harm, or want to spy on them. She doesn’t want to take things from them. She isn’t even advocating overthrowing their power. *She’s accepting of the idea that we’re ruled by non-humans*, but doesn’t want us to become dependent on them. She's simply using logic, but people act like she’s the KKK in space. Ashley Williams is not some hateful, xenophobic racist. She’s mildly and understandably distrustful and uses history and examples to back up her case.\n\nI actually think her attitude grounds the setting and gives it a lot of authenticity. Movies like to sort everyone into “normal people” and “the KKK”, but it’s never that simple in real life. She reflects the attitudes of normal, honest people in the real world.","score":"21","subreddit":"masseffect"}

{"body":"I stayed in the Price Tower about three months ago; they converted about two floors near the top to become hotel rooms.\n\nFirst off; you are right about Bartlesville; it was picked because it was the home of several oil barons (its where philips 66 was founded). But it really truly is in the middle of god damned nowhere. \n\nIt had always been a bucket list dream to stay there so I was so happy that I was able to do it.\n\nBut, let me tell you, it is a DEEPLY weird building. An example; is is not actually a particularly large building. Rather than having one or two larger elevators; the are four elevators around a small central core. And each elevator is shaped like a weird trapezoid and are definitely the tiniest elevators I'd ever been in. Two people is cramped as hell (and did me and my claustrophobia no favors).\n\nSo the room my brother and I stayed in was SPECTACULAR. It two floors tall; a top floor that overlooks a living room below; all fronted by a massive set of windows.\n\nHere's a photo of the bottom floor\nhttps://exp.cdn-hotels.com/hotels/2000000/1580000/1579500/1579427/1579427_3_y.jpg\n\n(though there was a different configuration when I stayed there.\n\nAnd on this page the background image shows the top floor.\n\nhttp://www.pricetower.org/stay/\n\nDefinitely a gorgeous room.\n\nBut, there is so much weirdness. First off, there are almost no right angles anywhere in the building. So the stairs between the floors are angled; so that where your left foot drops down about 4-6 inches closer to you than your right foot. IF you concentrate you can make it down the stairs ok. But if you are drunk, tired, or just not paying attention, you are almost certainly gonna find yourself tumbling down these very hard concrete stairs. You can sort of make out the angle in this photo: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f6/b8/37/f6b83716d11415114016fb43d633a2a2.jpg\n\nWright was famously a small dude and tended to design things with is proportions in mind (so I've heard). And the bathrooms were no exceptions. I almost had to turn sideways to fit in the bathroom, and the nook where the toilet is in is so tight that I honestly had trouble sitting down in there.\n\nThe couches and seats in the room were not designed by wright; but designed to evoke Wright by way of mid-century modern. They LOOK great, but are the most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat on.\n\nThe layout of the building and the internal structure of it apparently prevents any one floor of \"opening up\". Basically every floor has a set of rooms and they can't really be connected. So they have a restaurant on the top floors; but the dining room in in one room, another dining room is a floor below; and in another room is the kitchen; and staff would constantly walk up and down another version of those same terrible stairs.\n\nApparently every single large items is brought up and into each room via ropes and pulleys on the outside of the building; I mean everything; there's no way even a twin mattress would fit in the elevator. It's basically the way you filled most tall buildings like in the 10s and 20s... but by the time the Price tower was built every large building would have a service elevator to accommodate large items.\n\nAlso it's funny that it's called \"the skyscraper of the prairie\" because it' actually quite tiny. My mom lives in Richmond BC; a suburb of Vancouver; there are at least 100 condo buildings in richmond; all unremarkable, and all bigger than the price tower.","score":"35","subreddit":"RetroFuturism"}

{"body":"I feel there's a reason for that and I'll make an analogy to chess to explain how I see CLG. I think you can think of a team comp + early game strategy as being like a chess opening. You know how in chess the various standard openings have certain names, like the King's Gambit or the Sicilian Defense?\n\nIn chess certain players get really good at certain openings and they even become known for favoring certain openings. If you think about it, CLG used to be known for favoring a \"protect the ADC\" style back when Doublelift was on the team. The whole thing about the openings to chess is that your opponent also knows the standard openings and has thought about how to counter it. And so very quickly you require variations on the openings to counter your opponent's counter... To really master an opening, you have to be able to roll with the punches and adapt and learn all the variations that can come at you.\n\nI feel like CLG has like 3 different \"chess\" openings that they work on at any given time during a season. I'm talking about a certain team comp on a certain side of the map with a certain early game (with variations as needed to roll with the punches). And they're not equally good at all of them. So I think when you see them on the \"opening\" they're best at (which probably involves Huhi on Aurelion Sol), then they're going to look like chess grand masters on the rift. They're going to be countering everything the opponent is trying to do and attacking at just the times. But... if they don't end up being able to play one of their better openings, then if they see a variation they aren't used to then the game becomes chaotic. They don't know what the counter is yet. But they learn from their mistakes and get better at that opening.\n\nPoint being that I think CLG on a mature patch playing their best opening has a good shot against even the best teams in the world. But CLG at that same time playing their next best opening has opportunities for the opponent to throw them off their game. ","score":"42","subreddit":"leagueoflegends"}

{"body":"The lore posts offer a great starting place, but I'm not sure any of them explicitly answer this question. From a gameplay standpoint, the devs wanted to do several things. They wanted to make Summoner and Scholar fit with the existing lore, they wanted to test out the concept of a class that branches into two jobs, and they wanted to expand the simple idea of \"summoning an entity\" into a full job.\n\n* Arcanists as a class already existed in game lore from 1.0.\n* \"Summoning\" in the sense of actually calling forth the summoned creatures (called Primals here) that are staples of the series already existed in game lore from 1.0, and it was not feasibly something the player character could have access to.\n\nTo achieve these goals and solve these problems, the devs created the concept of arcanima present in the lore posts, which included the concept of creating an artificial elemental based on this scientific and mathematical understanding of the way aether flows in order to create magical effects.\n\nThe poisons, e.g. Bio and Miasma, are essentially the effect of using arcanima to disrupt the natural flow of aether within a living creature, which causes sickness. So, to contrast, the arcanima could be used to coalesce aether into what amounts to an artificial life form, or it can be used to disrupt aether in an existing natural life form. In the same way, Physick changes the flow of aether in existing natural life forms in a way that accelerates natural healing.\n\n**tl;dr**, since Summoning in the lore of Final Fantasy XIV involves manipulating the flow of aether to create artificial life with math or arcanima, the devs extrapolated that an Arcanist's combat magic could include bolstering and disrupting natural life with math as well.","score":"46","subreddit":"ffxiv"}

{"body":"I love waking up and not having to go to work. In fact, I haven't worked years. I even dropped out of college after I found the wallet. It was a Swiss Army wallet, grey and black checkered with the little red cross on it in the corner. It held my ID, an American flag, and a contact card, which was basically a business card without the business, at all times. However, the rest of the contents changed by the day. I always manage to have the right amount of money in that thing. Cashiers find it a little strange when I manage the exact change of an object and have none left over. Especially when I'm buying a TV or a sofa.\n\nThe money is never consistent. Some days, it gives me Starbucks gift cards, with the amount preloaded onto the card. Others, I'll get Reddit Gold, and I know that I'll see a great post on Reddit today. Still other days, I'll wake up with nothing, realize I have to go to the grocery store or get a call to go out with some friends, and arrive only to realize I have money in my wallet. The most I've ever received is a Visa Platinum card, with a ceiling of $417,825.73, which just so happens to be the MSRP of a 2016 Rolls-Royce Phantom. \n\nDays like those make me question if the future is fixed. I've never caught the wallet filling itself, which teaches me one of two things: one, the wallet doesn't want me to see it get filled, or two, the wallet knows that as long as I stare at it I won't need any money. How does the wallet know how much money I will need? It knows before even I know, so either the wallet knows me better than I know myself, or my future is predetermined, a fixed point in time, and that what I'm gonna do is what I'm gonna do no matter what. \n\nBut today, today was different. I woke up with one bill, valued at $10,000,000.00 with the face of Franklin Roosevelt on one side and an eagle on the other. Besides those changes, the bill looked almost exactly like a $100. I had no clue what this could mean. Could the government be accepting the bill as legal tender? Well, then I wouldn't be spending it, so something else must have to happen. I always went to bed with an empty wallet. \n\nAs I stood in my kitchen contemplating my predicament, I failed to notice the front door open and close softly. I also failed to notice the figure dash across the room, hit me over the head with a shovel, and watch me fall unconscious to the ground. \n***\nPart 2 coming when I get back from swim practice!","score":"31","subreddit":"WritingPrompts"}

Large Prize Pool: the worse the tourney the bigger the pool must be and visa versa. If a tourney is shit tier but pays half a million they will go, if it's the best tourney in the world but for a small prize pool they will go as well (summit ect.)\n\n2. Prestige: attending the tourney is a big deal in itself due to the brand of the org and can net them a invite to a major or the international if they do well (ESL ect.)\n\n3. Team Growth: if a tourney can make them look at the game in a new way and help them think of new starts  strengths and grow as a team by learning more about each other and hero interactions which could be useful in the future  (Elim mode ect) \n\nNow let's look at a ability draft tourney:\n\n3 is out, you don't really learn anything from playing ability draft cause the interactions can't ever really happen in game that you would learn. 2 is out, no one is gonna invite you to a Major for winning a Abilty Draft tourney. 1 would be the only real way to make it happen, but it would need to be some serious fucking cash to get tier 1 teams to attend, and even then some would still decline since 2 and 3 are missing. \n\nIn the end this would be amazing, but finding tier 1 teams to play it would  be hard as he'll without like 100k at LEAST for first place. Probs more like 500K since it's so weird to play Abilt Draft\n\nNow up and coming teams or even a community tourney on the other hand would be possible, but would You, reading this, watch that? Players you haven't heard of or hardly heard of playing abilty draft? If the answer is yes, by all means let me know. But from my experience the dota community seems to not care much about growing  or random community members. Would love to be proved wrong tho!","score":"118","subreddit":"DotA2"}

If you have trouble combating this kind of play, you need to create a game plan with you team, or if you are a confident enough strategist, tell them your plan and lead them. \n\nI know the standard dota response to 5 man, you have 2-4 people sit behind the tower thinking, well if they are pushing I should be here and defend. No. If they are 5 manning your tower, you know where their blink initiation heroes and supports probably are? Behind them, smoke up, wrap around and get an early numbers advantage. \n\nThe reason people get away with 5 manning is its easy to do, but it leaves you open to losing a lot of your advantage if things go south, so you have to be able to exploit the draw back of the 5 man. If your team is just completely incapable of fighting them, split push. If Radiant sends 5 top to take a t1 and push t2, and you know you can't fight it, you should already be bot pushing their towers, they can't send the whole team to stop you because only one person gets the short TP, when you see someone leave their push, farm their jungle and move to mid, or if you have good vision and know its just one person, kill them, and go defend the t2 with a numbers advantage.\n\nThis meta has become a lot about fighting and taking control of the map, 5 man is a way to do that; you need to know how to play against that. If you see your carry void with 15 min echo sabre trying to farm back into the game, you gotta tug those reigns and make sure he understands that that ain't happening, you need to fight.

You are walking on egg shells, apologizing for things that you shouldn't just to keep peace, revolving your life around his needs and wants and it is all based on fear. What would have happened you didn't cook HIS vegetables? Likely the same reaction, I would bet. That is not normal. In a relationship you want to do things for the other person out of love, not fear. The fact that you could not respond back to any allegations is very telling. In a normal relationship, you get to have an equal dialogue and proper two way communication. Not apologize and keep quiet.\n\nAnd he has not reciprocated at all towards you.

{"body":"\u0026gt;In the last days of 2016, there were systematic “preemptive strikes” from several mayors, government institutions and nongovernmental organizations against people who would celebrate the New Year. Turkey’s Religious Affairs Directorate claimed it “illicit” for Turkey’s Muslim citizens to celebrate the new year. Banners showing a bearded man punching Santa Claus in the face were hung around Istanbul, while a group pointed guns at their friend in a Santa costume to demonstrate their protest over secular New Year’s Eve celebrations. Santa is associated with Christmas and New Year’s in predominantly Muslim Turkey. On the morning of Dec. 31, a headline in an Islamist newspaper read, “This is our last warning, DO NOT celebrate.”\n\nThe closer you get to Islam and further away you get from secularism.

Are they the same?  In Rust, you'd just specify, but C++ has no way of expressing this.  So, you'd have to do global analysis to work that out.  The problem with *that* is that if the compiler can't work it out, it has no way of knowing who's to blame.  Is the function's body wrong?  Is how it's being *used* wrong?  Is one caller using it correctly, but another not?  Which is which?\n\nSo far as I know, you *can* do this sort of analysis with C++.

{"body":"I'd say that's probably pretty unlikely, excepting RAM of course. The GPU you are correct isn't likely to be competitive; the very latest flagship mobile SoCs like Snapdragon 820/821 and Apple's A10 are just now capable of exceeding the 360 GPU's 240 GFLOPS, while the Broadcom VideoEngine IV in the RPi3 is capable of a meager 28.8 GFLOPS. The CPU is harder to gauge, but assuming they continue to use some configuration of Cortex-A53 cores (likely, since ARM hasn't announced any successor in that power/price envelope) they aren't likely to surpass the 360 any time soon. In terms of theoretical performance, the 3.2 GHz PowerPC-based 3C/6T Xenon CPU in the 360 is capable of about 115 GFLOPS (at 12 FLOPS/cycle * 3.2 GHz * 3 cores). It's harder to find good data on Cortex-A53's theoretical performance per cycle, but considering A15 was around 1 FLOP/cycle and A53 targets a lower level of performance, that would be a generous estimate to go by. In that case, the quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 in the RPi3 would manage around a rip-roaring 5 GFLOPS.\n\n  \nNow of course everything you do with a processor isn't a simple floating-point operation, and raw theoretical performance in FLOPS doesn't always translate to better performance in the real world (the Fury X actually has higher theoretical performance than the GTX 1080, for example), but typically you're going to need to be within an order of magnitude to be competitive.\n\n\nIt's easy to forget now since the 8th-gen consoles (PS4/XB1) were mid-range hardware at best when they launched, but the 360 especially was really quite high-end hardware when it landed (the PS3 less so due to the very crucial year in between that saw both the GeForce 8800 and the Core 2 Quad arrive).","score":"50","subreddit":"pcmasterrace"}

{"body":"(1) Makes sense, but is almost tautological and reveals nothing interesting. Justice is incompatible with injustice. That's just how opposites work.\n\n(2) This is where I have a problem. \"Justice\" is inherently normative. Justice is about what *should* be done versus what *should not* be done. You say we should minimize injustice--in other words, we should refrain from doing moral wrongs. This, again, is pretty definitional and no one would disagree. But what my problem is with the statement that \"the outcome of the political economy figures out over time.\" When you endorse a concept like justice, you endorse that societies and individuals should do some things and not others, or hold some goals and not others.\n\nI think, in context with three, you mean, and please correct me, that an unjust act is one that produces an unjust result, and that the workings of cost negotiation will eventually figure out what means are best to this end. I'd have no problems with this. It's something which might be contentious, but it's valid.\n\n(3) Prosperity, social justice, institutional maturity, peace, and sustainable growth. These are your five \"earned justices\" correct? This is what I was asking for when I asked about what you consider justice.\n\nProsperity, peace, and sustainable growth are fairly clear, I suppose.\n\nSocial justice and institutional maturity seem kind of recursive. Saying social justice is a type of justice will get a \"you don't say\" reaction from a lot of people for good reason. It's literally in the name. All social justice is is \"justice\", whatever that means, applied to society. You still haven't explained what this justice in social justice *is*. You've just phrased it to say that your conception of justice should apply to the whole of society and not simply individuals.\n\nAs for institutional maturity... you're essentially saying that the result of minimizing injustice is institutions which... minimize injustice? I hope I don't need to explain why this appears circular to outsiders like me who are . . . well, not entirely informed or convinced on your theory.","score":"27","subreddit":"badpolitics"}

{"body":"Sorry, I like two guys beating the shit out of each other in a match over flippy shit. It's not only my opinion - people I know who have watched thousands of wrestling matches agree with me.\n\nIt's a well established known fact that Triple H has been trying to subtly bury Roman and bring 'his' NXT guys in for a while now. \n\nThere is a power struggle between HHH and Kevin Dunn over the future of the company. HHH only wants his pet projects to get over, and Dunn is doing what he can to take them down a notch on the other side, because HHH and Stephanie have made clear that as soon as they get the chance, Dunn is out the door. The more Dunn can make HHH's ideas and judgment of talent seem questionable to Vince, the longer he can put off that happening.\n \nHHH was an advocate for Reigns and had no problem with him as the guy for a long time. Then Vince and Dunn got a little too on board with Reigns as the top guy and he was no longer just seen as HHH's project like The Shield was. HHH only wants guys who are HHH projects through and through getting over at the top level because he's planning on taking over the company one day and the transition may or may not be a peaceful one. The more guys who are around that owe him their success, the less resistance he is likely to face. So by getting rid of guys like Dunn, HHH is ultimately neutralizing Vince the same way chemotherapy often neutralizes a tumor by cutting off its blood supply. Vince may be CEO and Chairman of the Board for the next two decades, but when all of Vince's old cronies have been replaced with HHH cronies, Vince's title is just a vanity one because \"his\" guys are gone. One day, he'll look up and realize he doesn't run his company anymore, and it will have all happened so incrementally that he didn't even notice it until after the fact.\n \nIt affects Reigns because HHH puts forth ideas that he absolutely knows will hurt Reigns under the guise of helping him.\n \nOr just google \"#politicalhit\"\n\n","score":"-6","subreddit":"SquaredCircle"}

But for how long? If you expect to pass through 4 intersections that regularly are spaced 2 minutes at current flow rates and have a typical cycle of 1 minute. You would have to turn every single light green across the major road (perhaps 100km?) for 12 full minutes instead of the usual 1. This is obviously unacceptable for traffic at the minor roads intersecting and breaks down completely if ANYWHERE across the entire length of the road has any form of congestion that will not self resolve immediately.\n\n\n\u0026gt; I guess I just don't understand why having a light that turns green as soon as the next light turns red would help ease congestion.\n\nSay you have traffic lights A and B allong a given road such that traffic flows from A to B.\n\nBy clearing out B first, you allow the traffic at A to quickly and efficiently pass through the intersection at A in the least amount of time with the highest rate of flow.\n\nIt clears out intersection B to allow clear uninterrupted ingress for traffic coming from A. By the time traffic from A has stopped at B - the traffic that was initially at B has found themselves held up somewhere around C or D. If you expect B to remain green for A originating traffic - you would have to somehow clear out the traffic from C, D ... Z and so on.\n\nRemember you also must allow time AND SPACE for side streets to not only flow across the intersection but also to merge ONTO the main road.

{"body":"Here's the text in case you can't go to the site. **Don't comment on this comment, add it like normal to the post itself!**\n\n\u0026gt; Season 4 is coming to SMITE! As with every season, we have a host of new features and content for all our players. Clash is receiving a new makeover in the style of the Egyptian Pantheon, the highly-anticipated Celtic Pantheon is making its debut, and Starter Builds and Items will never be the same. Let’s take a closer look at these updates.\n\n\u0026gt; ###Clash Revamp and Update\n\n\u0026gt; The battle raging on the Greek Isles has moved to the middle of Egypt! Clash has been updated with a whole new map themed around the Egyptian Pantheon, complete with new structures, statues, and a backdrop featuring the Pyramids of Egypt. Clash is also seeing significant gameplay changes. The Fire Giant and Gold Fury have been removed and the map has new walls, directing people towards the center of the map where they face a new threat: Apophis.\n\n\u0026gt; Apophis is a new boss battle, exclusive to the new Clash Map. As the battle rages on, Apophis spawns, ready to give his favor to those who best him in combat. Beware: he is no pushover.\n\n\u0026gt; ###Celtic Pantheon is here. The Morrigan arrives.\n\n\u0026gt; The Morrigan will join the roster of SMITE gods and usher in the brand new Celtic Pantheon. This deceptive Mage can take the form of any God on the battleground, using their strengths against them and deceiving her opponents. We are excited to explore the gods available in the Celtic pantheon and bring them to you over the course of Season 4.\n\n\u0026gt; Players will be able to learn more about The Morrigan and the Celtic Pantheon with the Celtic Event happening early this year. Similar to the Rising Dawn, players will be able to unlock a myriad of content by playing an interactive board game during the Path of the Phantom Queen. Test your fate by rolling the dice and completing the challenges set in your path to unlock rewards.\n\n\u0026gt; ###New Items, Consumables, and Balance Changes\n\n\u0026gt; There is also no shortage of balance changes happening in Season 4. The biggest goal going into Season 4 has been to give players more choice in their Starter Builds. Traditionally players would pick up their favorite starter Item, Boots, and Potions before heading off to lane. In Season 4, all tier one items have been re-balanced and repriced to be paired with a starter item, giving players control of their builds in a way they haven’t had before.\n\n\u0026gt; Consumables are also receiving a large number of additions. Players will be able to experiment with new starting consumables as well as high-cost and powerful late-game consumables. These consumables will provide players with late-game power and utility at a high price.\n\n\u0026gt; ###League Splits and Updates\n\n\u0026gt; Ranked play is also seeing a few changes. Season 4 will begin fresh, with all player’s divisions and hidden MMR being reset. If you have ever wanted to show your stuff now is the time to hop in and make your mark! Season 4 Ranked will also be divided into Splits. Following the Pro Scene, Ranked will be divided similar segmented times of play. As each Split comes to an end, players will be rewarded for their achievements and the ladder will see a soft reset, giving players a new chance to climb the ladder.\n\n\u0026gt; These changes combined with other item, God, and Conquest Map adjustments will give players a chance to learn and explore a new meta with large amount of variety and show off their skills while doing it. While these are some of the biggest changes coming, we have many more surprises in store for Season 4.\n\n\u0026gt; Stay on the lookout for more details and we’ll see you on the Battleground of the Gods in Season 4!","score":"24","subreddit":"Smite"}
