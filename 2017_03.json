Many people use cannabis for medicinal reasons and are actually *more* productive and functional after they use it, so using during the day would be the most beneficial to them and their lives. \n\nI'm a budtender at a dispensary in a legal state and I have many patients who benefit greatly from day time use. I see people who suffer anxiety that can be paralyzing use cannabis during the day so that they can relax their brain enough to overcome that anxiety and function optimally at work, or at whatever task they may be completing that day. It's a great alternative to having to take a benzodiazepine like Xanax every day. I also see people who are in chronic pain take it during the day so that they have enough relief from the pain to work or play with their children. Some even use it as an alternative to the extremely addictive opioids they'd otherwise be prescribed by their doctor for the very same pain. Some people use it for gastrointestinal issues (Crohn's, IBS, GERD, chronic nausea, etc.) before every meal, yes - even at breakfast and lunch, so that they could work up the appetite to eat and keep their food down, or calm their chronically upset guts, and thus have the energy to sustain themselves through the rest of their day. Cannabis has actually been found to provide an even greater relief than many commonly used medications, with less side effects as well. From experience I've seen that there are *many* valid, and even good, reasons to use cannabis during the day for many people.","score":"37","subreddit":"teenmom"}

{"body":"By the same token, the current state of ISPs in this country is due to excessive regulation, not of the sort that hurts them, but of protectionist regulation that protects them from dealing with real competition.\n\nI seem to remember Comcast and Time Warner both having a shit-fit about the possibility of their being classified as a utility and falling under telecom rules. They were both crying about 'muh capitalism' and not being able to provide better services. The fact is, they are full of bullshit and apparently missed one of the defining hallmarks of capitalism: competition. They are not capitalist businesses and the protectionist regulation that protects their markets is proof of that. The way they try to sue newcomers, like Google Fiber, into oblivion with every market expansion proves that.\n\nIn reality, there is no competition in the ISP market. Satellite is a joke if you need anything with decent latency and DSL is as fast as it's going to get while Cable and Fiber have wildly outpaced it. For Comcast and Time Warner to provide faster speeds, there is no great outlay, they only have to set aside more frequencies on their coax as bonding channels and upgrade or reconfigure their headends, perhaps provide the customer with a newer Cable Modem with a new version of DOCSIS. Hell, they should be occasionally upgrading and replacing the headends in the normal course of business anyway. Upgrading speed is not some tremendous, expensive feat for them. For fiber, most of what's been laid already only needs NID and backend changes when newer hardware that supports faster speeds comes out... it isn't like either of these technologies will require miles of new media to be laid as the companies seem to be insinuating.\n\nIf anything, we need to be drying up the anti-competitive regulation out there that is protecting them, then lets see if they can survive on a real playing field.","score":"2","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

The authentic controller has a very large nub in the center of the d-pad (underside).

What you need to do is rush a vamp scepter, and then go straight for sheen and tabis. Sheen will help wreck her in trades, and vamp scepter is just for the sustain. Tabis should always be a rush vs auto champs imo. Plus, the extra early movement speed should help you with dodging some of her qs.\n\nAs far as matchup tips go, dodge her w by attack moving while you e. This will allow you to move to where you won't get stunned by the w, so you don't even have to worry about when you stun. Also, I believe the best time to use your e is when she tries to use her auto attack reset ability that gives her the slowing and critting autos. Finally, whenever she ults you, attack move to a wall. If you keep a vital between you and the wall, she won't be able to hit it, and you should win the all in.\n\nBut I do agree on fiora being a little op right now though.

In the long term, 2018 midterm elections for the House and Senate come up and both the GOPe backers of Ryancare and the Democrats behind Obamacare get voted out and replaced. Now is the time for civic minded 'pedes to put together a campaign to challenge them.

{"body":"I don't visualize though. My daydreams are more...conceptual I guess? I don't visualize being somewhere else or doing something, it's more monologue-y. \"Gee, I could be outside at the baseball game right now. It's nice out, just enough breeze and cloud to keep from roasting me alive, and it's probably going to be a good game because...\" There's no visual component to that.\n\nJust like when I'm reading about the shadow of a fallen angel taking up residence in the head of a wizard and helping him stay alive or play music, I don't visualize the description that she often appears as a classically beautiful woman in robes and sandals, I just get those concepts. If you wanted me to describe Lash on my own as I see her, I couldn't do it because she's just an amalgamation of concepts. I've never ever had the issue that a character in a book-based movie doesn't look like they did in my head (aside from nitpicky things like he has blue eyes when they make a huge deal in the book about the character having green eyes). I can visualize the red triangle or whatever if I put my mind to it (pun intended). But the result always feels incomplete and faint and fuzzy and is a huge strain. I don't seem to do it without the conscious effort.\n\nOooh! I think this will get my point across better. If I try to call up my apartment or office, either to walk through in the dark or sketch out in another location, I don't visualize it at all. It's more like I have a spreadsheet of relationships in my head. The end table is next to the futon, they have these characteristics, it's a bit over two steps from the futon to the tv. A step to the right facing the tv is the desk with computer, a little over a step back from the desk is the beginning of the dinner table....At no point do I call up a mental image of the room, though if I tried at it I could do so. \n\nYet I CAN hear things in my head. Music, dialogue. Book characters have distinct voices in my head. I can call up classical Spanish guitar numbers in my head, for instance. My inner monologue, when he gets going, is my voice as I hear it, no milk voice here! No smells however. \n\nI know we've strayed from the parent topic a fair bit, but it's just such cool stuff to think and talk about. Like, I'm sure that when I'm not thinking about anything, there's something going on in my head, but for some reason that information is not being written to short term memory.

For me as a believer in the 2nd Amendment I love to see that (even if we disagree on a lot of things, and i'm not even a republican) as it show's people still believe in the idea that they can influence the government solely through the threat of force. Plus the whole idea that if the US were to engage in a civil war it wouldn't just be us who are affected, but the fact that the stock market would go crazy, import/exports would drop, people in large cities would be cut off from the basic necessities of life, ultimately it wouldn't just affect the US, but the whole world, and that in of itself is the \"nuclear bomb\" that us as citizens hold and politicians should do everything in their power to avoid that situation from ever coming to play.

All that is said is \"He thought he had picked it up in Wyoming, Iowa, Illinois or Oklahoma\"   \n  \n  \n  What is the context?  Was he an antique collector?  Did he travel around and buy things?   Why would he have acquired a trunk?  Was he just a hoarder?  \n  \n  This is the part that needs to be cleared up.  Why did he have this stuff and what was his background and what kinds of places did he go and get these things.  It seems strange to lug around a huge trunk without any reason, unless maybe you are looking at collecting stuff or something.  \n  \n  This is a case where you could get at least a state with isotope analysis, and it would not be terribly expensive.  It would be worthwhile to test the bones and teeth for radioisotopes like Sr-90.  They did not exist on earth, in any significant quantities, before nuclear detonations stated taking place in 1945.  It could conclusively establish if it was a body from before World War II.  IF there are an ambulance of radioisotopes, it is probably mean the person was a child in the 1950's.   Complete absence would indicate the died before 1945.  \n  \n\n  This technique has been used (usually with cesium 137) to tell if vintage bottles of wine, claimed to be from the 1930's or earlier, are genuine or newer forgeries.","score":"4","subreddit":"UnresolvedMysteries"}

{"body":"\u0026gt;Your perspective is so utterly fucked.\n\nNo, yours is. Last I checked I wasn't the fascist demanding that my way of life, and the way of life of everyone else, be sacrificed just so a teenager over the internet could feel morally superior to other people because they voted for Bernie Sanders and think they're cool because they hate people who makes more money than them. Your philosophy, your beliefs, are evil, and they stand in direct opposition to the principles of freedom and liberty that defined this great country. So don't tell me my perspective is fucked, you should probably look in the mirror.\n\n\u0026gt; You honestly don't understand that a healthy populace is more productive?\n\nA healthy populace is *one of the reasons* that makes a populace productive, it is not the only factor. Though even if it was the only factor, your argument is irrelevant because the quality of life has been universally increasing across the developed world. There is nothing that indicates universal healthcare is needed to improve quality of life, nor is there any proof that it would. The # of insured LITERALLY means nothing. It's the quality and cost of care that matters. The sooner you know this, the sooner you'll actually be competent in a conversation about healthcare.\n\n\u0026gt;You're so desperately arrogant that you don't even look around. I hope you're legitimately well-off; it's the only excuse for that \"I've got mine, so Fuck everyone else\" attitude.\n\nYou're a fucking fascist. I don't have to care about you, nor should you be allowed to bring the government gun to my doorstep and confiscate my belongings because you want to express unearned moral superiority over other people. I give to my local charity. In fact, I GUARANTEE I've given more in this past year than you have in your entire pathetic life. But personal charity is entirely different from demanding I get shaken down, take away my hard earned money, and thereby taking my freedom away. No chance in hell, buttercup. If pathetic millennials like you actually donated to the poor where you live, actually contributed to society instead of complaining on a website about how the evil rich people are evil for having more money than you, this world might be a better place. Tell me: in the time that you have been shit posting on Reddit, have you done anything for the homeless man down the street? Did you? No. Fuck you.\n\nIt's pathetic that entitled and privileged children like you feel morally superior for demanding that I give up my money. But it's not even just my money. It's the money of *everyone* that has ever worked an honest days work in their life that you're demanding be given up. Yes, even the poor. All because you want to feel good about yourself. Wooo!!! Social Justice! Equality! Feminism! Intersectionality! Save me the fucking crap. I believe in personal responsibility. If you fuck up in life, that is entirely on you. If you major in Lesbian Dance Theory in college or Gender Studies and wonder why you don't have a job, or are stuck at McDonalds, maybe you can point to your individual life choices for fucking your life up. Not the SUPER EVIL RICH BOOGEYMAN. Not me. You. Which is precisely why it is immoral to demand, by threat of the government gun, that I submit, give you my money, and destroy my way of life and the  life of others. Just so you can feel better about yourself. \n\n\u0026gt;I actually care about Americans' lives\n\nNo you don't. You're driven by hatred and selfishness, I doubt you have a bit of care in your soul for people -- which is why you're so willing to destroy people's lives just because you feel it is necessary for you to realize some pathetic pipe dream.\n\n\u0026gt;I don't give two shits if the people who have been bleeding the cash out of our society feel it's unfair to them.\n\nYou're so ignorant, I can see why you don't know what you're talking about. Tell me, is Bill Gates \"bleeding the cash out of our society\" when he has donated over $28 Billion to charity? How about Warren Buffett when he has donated over $30 billion to charity? How about the people that work for Bill Gates and Warren Buffett? How do you think they feel? Perhaps we should just kick them out of business, raise their taxes, and spread some wealth around right? We should just confiscate 80% of Bill Gate's property, and give it to Donald Trump's Administration! How about that?! Would that make you feel better about yourself?

We have mainly tested in on 64-bit Windows, especially Windows 10 and 7, as these are the most popular and most likely to be running on VR-capable systems.\n\nThis installer installs to a different path than the previously released all-in-one installer -- C:\\Program Files\\HDK-Software-Suite -- so it won't overwrite any OSVR Server configuration files or existing binaries you have installed.  You should be able to run it side-by-side with the old installer if you really want to, but we certainly don't recommend that configuration, as the start menu group and shortcuts alone could get confusing.  While we understand your reluctance to mess with a functional configuration, we believe that this new installer is a massive improvement over the previous release and are aware of no regressions (i.e. we are not aware of anything that works better with the old installer).\n\nDoes that answer your questions?\n\nEdit to answer your new question: By positional tracking and IR camera, I'm referring to the positional tracking you get with the IR camera that comes in the box with your HDK.

I started with the two Nip and Fab Pads, using the BHA in the morning, and the AHA in the evening, after a building up to this amount for a few weeks. This cleared up a ton of my closed comedones, but I have some pretty stubborn closed comedones. I bought the MUAC serum and have been loving it for the past few weeks. I have to warn you that it's very strong though. It's been helping to clear my skin, however I only went up to this stronger percentage after my skin had gotten 100% used to the Nip and Fab pads. I really do like those pads, they are very convenient, and very effective. I would start with maybe the Nip and Fab Glycolic Fix Extreme Pads, or even something similar like the Pixi Glow Tonic, at 5% glycolic acid, a few times a week to start with.

Vaseline on the other hand, has been amazing for my skin. I found it better moisturizing, and it did not break me out at all! In fact, the first night I tried it, I found my skin looked, and felt much better than when I had been using the oil. Everyone's skin is different though, and yours might love the oil.

Aiming for a more casual, friendly, and local experience rather than a hardcore experience with games like Uncharted, Mass Effect, Far Cry, Dishonored, and the like. They have games like Zelda and Splatoon to bring over some of the more serious crowd. \n\nMost people that would have a PS4, XBOX, or PC have one already and are not even considering the Switch if it's their first console. It doesn't detract that Nintendo consoles tend to be really good additions after having one already. \\\n\nThis is the general consensus I have had when discussing the Switch and Nintendo consoles in general amongst non-gamers and gamers alike with the biggest reason being that they knew there will be a Mario Kart game, some sort of Smash Bros, and Mario Party at one point in time.\n\nI for one would not be in that list as I would prefer a PS4 over a Switch at this point in time due to how many amazing exclusives they are getting, especially now that cemu has been progressing so well and I have a backlog of amazing Wii U games to play through before even thinking about going through any Switch games.","score":"1","subreddit":"cemu"}

{"body":"Gonna just stream-of-consciousness things to think about that I don't think have been said yet:\n\n* Mug Bloodlust is a great skill that stacks with Full Break and Power Break(down) while buffing your character. If you want to run good debuff stacking teams, thieves tend to excel at that anyway (Vaan, Zidane, and Rikku all have relics that have neat steal-type debuffs)--which adds to Mug Bloodlust's desirability as a 6-star ability.\n* Def/Res Debuffs have a soft-cap of 70%. Atk/Mag have a soft-cap of 65%. This is generally meaningless on hard content as pretty much all bosses are debuff resistant, making hitting that cap generally not feasible.\n* To give you an idea of what to expect, Power Breakdown + Full Break on a debuff resistant boss is effectively a ~25% reduction of Physical damage. Add something like Cleansing Strike (-50% ATK/MAG, 25% resisted) and the effective reduction becomes ~38%. \n* On the flip side, Armor Breakdown + Fullbreak allow you to do ~20% more physical damage. Adding something like Freya's Burst (Atk/DEf -50%, 25% resisted) allows you to do ~40% more.\n* If you can afford to use them, many of the debuff Burst commands (like Tyro's) stack with Support abilities, but it's somewhat controversial about whether they're worth using. I use Tyro's BSB pretty often for ProShellga and/or Mblink, but it's hard to use his commands because 4/5 turns in Burst mode I'll be using his support abilities. (Ex: Fullbreak \u0026gt; X Breakdown \u0026gt; CMD1 \u0026gt; Fullbreak \u0026gt; X Breakdown \u0026gt; Burst Over.) However, it's more reliable if you are running 2 supports, thieves with support commands (Zidane, Vaan) or a support hybrid (Minfilia, Terra, Quistis) along with your dedicated support. While they take care of one or more of the major breakdowns, Tyro/DebuffBurster can now do something like: FullBreak \u0026gt; CMD1 \u0026gt; CMD2/Wrath \u0026gt; Fullbreak \u0026gt;CMD1 \u0026gt;CMD2/Wrath. The main thing I want to point out is that it's pretty much never a good idea to neglect Full Break(30%) + Power/Magic Breakdown(40%) for a 20% Burst command.\n* This might sound like it clashes with my first point of how great Mug Bloodlust is, but Mug Bloodlust has the added advantage of buffing whoever's using it as well as being usable on characters that can often function as said thieves/hybrid supports anyway.\n\n* Generally speaking, mixed bosses tend to be more dangerous on the Magic side from my experience. If you're tight on ability slots and have to choose between Magic or Power Breakdown, I'd go with the former most of the time (pending actual data).\n\n* Cleansing Strike is the best Unique SB in the game, imo. I *still* use Cleansing Strike from time to time in end-game content.\n\nMain Source for numbers: My understanding of http://www.happypluto.com/%7Emisterp/r/ffrk.pdf !

{"body":"This is a good start, especially toward giving Americans more choice when it comes to how we pay for health care.\n\nHowever, I'm disappointed it doesn't address the root cost of health care, which is primarily due to government monopolization. Changing laws related to insurance is just rearranging the chairs on the Titanic.\n\n[Via Mises](https://mises.org/library/myth-free-market-healthcare): The AMA has purposefully recommended that State medical boards shut down medical schools since its inception. Since 1904, we have closed down 26% of our medical schools in the USA, while population increased 284% in the same time. The AMA has a government granted medical monopoly, and they want to restrict supply of doctors to keep their own salaries high.\n\nThe FDA plays a role, too. It costs [~$2.56 billion](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/30/the-cost-of-developing-an-fda-approved-drug-is-tru.aspx) to get a new drug approved by the FDA, and often takes ~10 years to get approval, assuming approval is ever granted. And Mises mentions that a 5-year delay in the release of an antibiotic could have led to the deaths of 80,000. [A lag in the release of beta-blockers may have cost 250,000 lives.](https://mises.org/library/pharmaceutical-prices-patents-and-fda)\n\nFinally, I would point out that there is no other industry where we require practitioners to have ~12 years of education, because it doesn't make economic sense. Each doctor only has 24 hours in a day, so it is unwise to pour so much training into every single professional. We are training doctors in too many different areas, when the economic cost of switching tasks is too high. In every other industry, [economic specialization](http://study.com/academy/lesson/specialization-in-economics-definition-lesson-quiz.html) is normal and expected. And yet we expect doctors to receive training to treat *all* diseases. In a truly free market, we would allow people to specialize in treating one disease, which reduces the cost of switching tasks. In the automotive industry, mechanics and shops specialize in treating different parts of the car, which reduces costs to the consumer. The only way to bring specialization to the health market would be to reform medical licensure, so that each doctor is not expected to learn 12 years worth of skills, but instead something more like 4 years of skills.\n\nUntil we get the government completely out of health care, it will remain unaffordable. No amount of insurance scheming can fix the root cost of health care.","score":"42","subreddit":"The_Donald"}

{"body":"We haven't actually had a ton of fresh-start servers and the conditions have been different each time. But in general, they end up being the highest pop servers since they attract the most new/returning players. This time around, the hype train coming in was pretty big because of the new patch and marketplace changes/restrictions on FS (3.0 FS was said to be the largest AA servers in any region in the world).\n\nBut the fact is that once the community in ArcheAge starts progressing past a certain point, it's no longer easy for new players or casual players to really get involved into the game, especially if they're solo. What I mean by that is fewer players are in starting zones, fewer players run early dungeons, gold inflation happens, content like land is taken up, etc. And then of course, once elements start getting introduced back into FS, people start freaking out about pay-to-win, start thinking they're going to be left behind in the dust, and just dip out.\n\nSo I'd say fresh-start server still maintain a high population for ArcheAge standards in the end. But it doesn't change the fact that they're largely composed of fickle hype trains that'll leave at the drop of a hat (and 3.0 had various technical problems that discouraged many players), so population drops over time until it stabilizes to the core community. Whether it'll \"die\" when next fresh-start happens will depend on the circumstances, AA is looking to go through many changes in the upcoming patches.","score":"1","subreddit":"archeage"}

{"body":"@oilernut\n\nRequiring a Class 4 license will do far more harm than good. To reduce drunk driving deaths, you need to recruit enough part-time ride-share drivers to meet peak demands at bar closing time, New Years eve, etc. Taxi drivers have Class 4 licenses, and that does nothing to stop a lot of them from driving like maniacs.  If a Class 5 drivers license is  good enough for carrying carpool passengers and family members, why is it not good enough for carrying ride-share passengers? Ottawa doesn't require the equivalent of a Class 4 license, and everything is fine there. Alberta imposed a Class 4 license requirement, and that has made it harder to recruit part-time drivers.\n\nEvidence-based policy-making entails looking at real-world experience. Starting with an assumption that Class 4 licenses are required and claiming, without evidence, that they will make things safer overall, amounts to policy-based evidence-making.\n\nHere are a few examples of maniac taxi drivers with Class 4 licenses:\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/taxi-driver-killed-in-victoria-crash-impaired-and-speeding-coroner-finds-1.3760557\n\nTaxi driver doing 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone on West King Edward Avenue in Vancouver just shrugs when passengers complain:\nhttps://www.yelp.ca/biz/yellow-cab-vancouver-2?hrid=Ex5iI3E8Cds6WhCF9YKYlQ\u0026amp;utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup\u0026amp;utm_medium=copy_link\u0026amp;utm_source=(direct)\n\nDriving infractions by taxi drivers constituted 43% of passenger complaints to Vancouver Yellow Cab between Jun 1 to Sep 2, 2015. See page 13: http://council.vancouver.ca/20151020/documents/rr3.pdf\n\nA 2014 public opinion survey (Metro Vancouver) found that taxi passengers reported:\n\n- reckless driving (24%)\n- personal safety at risk because could not hail taxi (9%)\n\nSee page 10: http://council.vancouver.ca/20151020/documents/rr3presentation.pdf\n\nIt costs time and money to issue Class 4 licenses which do nothing to improve safety. The money would be far more effectively invested in telematics and passenger feedback that can instantly report to dispatchers and police when a driver is doing 100 km/h in a 50 zone. Such an approach also lowers insurance premiums for safe drivers. Telematics on its own reduces insurance costs by 1/3. Passenger feedback reports things telematics can't see such as running red lights, tailgating, almost running over pedestrians and cyclists, and so on.\n\nA typical Vancouver taxi is driven 24/7 by multiple shifts of drivers and racks up 150,000 km per year. Some rack-up 250,000 km per year. Others, 50,000 km per year or less. The taxi drivers themselves say it makes more sense to do inspections on a per-km basis rather than on a fixed time basis. The typical part-time ride-share driver only carries passengers 10-15 hours per week. That's much closer to carpooling than running a 24/7 taxi!\n\nDispatch offices located within a municipality need a business license in that municipality. But if you create excessive upfront costs and bureaucracy, that will harm the small local app companies more than the big guys. To let the little guys compete with the big guys, it's better to minimize upfront costs and bureaucracy then recover costs on a per-km or per-ride basis.\n\nThe Manitoba government recently made legislative changes needed to allow ride-sharing. Part of the new legislation allows cities to charge tolls on taxis and ride-share vehicles. This allows variable-rate per-km congestion fees on passengerlesss or single-passenger taxis and ride-share vehicles in the most congested areas at the most congested times. Some cities do this to keep a lid on downtown traffic congestion. It encourages sharing of rides by multiple unrelated passengers. It discourages an excessive number of taxis from congregating downtown and cruising around and around the block looking for arm-wave type street hails.\n\nTo reduce wasteful bureaucratic duplication, the federal government should eliminate collection of GST from taxis and ride-share vehicles in cities that implement per-km tolls on taxis and ride-share vehicles. Taxi and ride-share drivers can deduct input expenses such as car payments, fuel, tires, and maintenance from the 5% GST collected. The federal government will only be getting 2 or 3% or so anyway. The cost of government paperwork to collect GST  from part-time drivers will likely exceed the amount collected. The federal government says they expect to collect only $3 million per year from GST on ride-share vehicles. They may wind up spending $30 million per year on paperwork to collect that $3 million. Opposition parties should keep an eye on this.\n\nCriminal record check is a must.\n\nThe City of Vancouver charges $570 per year for a taxi license. That works out to less than half a cent per km on average, barely enough for administrative costs. If a taxi driver cancels their license, a prorated refund less admin costs similar to an auto insurance refund would be fair.\n\nAny amount a taxi license speculator paid for a taxi license over and above what the government charged for it didn't go to the government. It went to into the pockets of previous taxi license speculators.\n\nThe only compensation the current batch of taxi license speculators can reasonably expect is to write off any loss as a tax deduction against taxi business earnings. But only if the current batch of taxi license speculators actually use the licenses to drive a taxi themselves instead of renting out the taxi licenses to drivers. And only if the previous crop of taxi license speculators paid taxes on the profits they made by selling licenses to the current crop of taxi license speculators at an inflated price. If the current crop of taxi license speculators paid cash to the previous batch of taxi license speculators, didn't get a receipt, and the previous batch of taxi license speculators didn't declare that cash for income tax purposes, then tough luck to all of them!","score":"-1","subreddit":"vancouver"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; One mistake against several wincons will cost you the game- much moreso than RG even. Examples? Elite Barbarians. X-Bow. Balloon. Three Musketeers too.\n\nTbh I would say 3m and loon mostly, as ebarbs and xbow are much easier to defend against in a 1-1 situation from my experience. Also, imo RG is too _versatile_ of a wincon. See: 1 mistake vs RG can cost you a tower, PLUS RG can basically get off guaranteed damage most of the time. Hog, 3m, ebarbs, are all extremely punishing, but without a high-damage spell finishing a tower at 500 hp can prove to be extremely tough to do if they're already used to countering your wincon. \n\nYes, RG should see some usage at equal levels, I'm just pointing out that no, \"RG is shit at equal levels and only good when overleveled\".\n\nYeah, 5 classics.

{"body":"Thank you for your nice comment. My opinion on Christianity is that's an outdated religion with outdated rules and beliefs that are completely incompatible with the modern world. There's a reason why it's declining rapidly in the developed world and that's because many people simply can't connect with it's teachings, especially younger people. The communities themselves don't fare much better and many people are off-put by them as well. There is so much division within Christianity (hundreds of different sects) that it should be clear to everyone that there is hardly any unity and consensus on Jesus' teachings. Jesus' message was revolutionary for its' time but 2000 years have passed and it's just not the same anymore, so it's no surprise to me that you and many other's just can't easily accept Christianity. It doesn't help that Christians state that they are the only true path to God while everyone else is wrong. \n\nI don't know what to suggest for you other than to continue researching other avenues for your goals. Not just the major religions but also minor ones that may not be so popular. You can expect better communities from small sects because of their low numbers.

We won\u0026amp;#039;t back down from protecting New Yorkers from terror - or from an overzealous administration fixated on xenophobia and needless division.\"\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/61vyd2/ag_sessions_threatens_sanctuary_cities_mayors/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~90256 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **City**^#1 **federal**^#2 **New**^#3 **immigrant**^#4 **York**^#5","score":"1","subreddit":"worldnewshub"}

{"body":"Story time. I remember over the summer I thought I was fucking done for.\n\nThe public park in my neighborhood is extremely empty and deserted at night (obviously because it's a park) and I just wanted to smoke alone. So I figured hey, there's literally nobody ever there so I'll just light a blunt in the parking lot real quick and head back home.\n\nSo I pull up to the park parking lot at about 1 AM. Coast is clear. I pull out the blunt and start smoking it, my fucking luck right as I start puffing it, a cop car with bright ass high beams pulls up and parks right next to me. I'm frozen, still holding the blunt and just staring at the cop car. I knew at this moment I was absolutely fucking fucked.\n\nThe cops both get out of the car, COMPLETELY walk past my car and walk straight into the park. I didn't want to seem suspicious by just driving off so I put the blunt out and sprayed my car. A minute later the cops come back out along with 10 teenagers who were ALL playing Pokémon GO. Then the cops just got right back in their car and drove away. I was in shock.\n\nTL;DR: I went to the park late at night to smoke a blunt in my car, as soon as I light up the blunt a cop car pulls up right next to me as I'm still holding it, they walk right past me to kick out some teenagers who were playing Pokémon GO and then left.","score":"22","subreddit":"trees"}

Then hope to get lucky with pitchers and also carrying a lot or arms on your bench and just hope the schedule is good to you, by that not running into the top sp's when they have 2 start weeks.\n\nFor example looking ahead you could find a free agent with 2 starts who could be projected to score more then Kershaw in a one start week where you'd never find a free agent hitter who you'd project to score more then a top hitter","score":"2","subreddit":"fantasybaseball"}

Notice that many pros will actually rotate on the ball or toes on lower power shots. \n\nAs you throw, let your follow through left the back foot naturally - Watch Eric Oakley or Shusterick - they'll balance on their right foot after the throw. Centering your weight over that foot like this will help the rotation. All the weight is above it - instead of trying to sling it around in a wider arc. Go try it - carefully - on a tile floor with socks. Not an xstep; just a nice, easy, rotation.\n\nMaybe you've got a ton of traction on your shoes, which may not help.\n\nEdit - got your videos to play in a different browser - it's your front foot. You're putting *all* your weight onto the outside of your foot, which creates a ton of drag as your try to force it around to face forward. You can see your instep come clean off the ground. You're not landing on the ball of your foot, even if you think you are. You're thinking about it, and stopping your weight shift before your body motion does the work for you.

Truly.\n\nCongrats on being one game better than us in the B1G this year. It's a good thing too, because as we all know you finishing one game ahead of us this year erases every other result in recent memory. Like us finishing 8 games ahead of you last year. Or that over the past 3 years we're 9 games better than you in B1G play. Or 20 games better than you in the past 5 years. Or the fact that you haven't won a non vacated B1G title since 82. That's 35 years! Another way to put it: your school's basketball ineptitude is now old enough to be president! And if Trump being elected shows anything, your school is just inept enough to be elected too!\n\nIt's a good thing you won this game too, considering you hadn't beaten us since 2011!

But luckily you guys finished a game ahead of us, so all of this is forgotten.\n\nLets not forget how this also erases all past football results too! Like our football \"rivalry\", you know, the one where we lead the series 74-25-3. Since you're a Minnesota fan and probably can't do basic math, that means that your winning percentage in that series is 24.5%! Shockingly enough, that's more inept than your basketball program's recent performances! And the only time you've beaten us in the past decade is because we had our worst run program ever, and even that win was overshadowed by the fact that our AD/coach were basically fired as a result of that game. But luckily all of that's erased because you're ahead of us in the standings by one game!\n\nAlso erased now: The fact that the only time you've been relevant in football in recent years is because of a sexual assault scandal resulting in the firing of your head coach.

{"body":"Jess Phillips is typically forthright when I text to ask her about the political events of last week, and what they mean for her party. “The Copeland result is a historic catastrophe,” she replies on Saturday morning, in between moving house and trying to organise her two young children. “Those all about ‘straight-talking honest politics’ are spinning like ballerinas, trying to make out it is just a blip. The voting public are not stupid. They see through this. If the Labour Party and is leaders don’t wake up, this catastrophic result will be the first of many and we’d have done little more than collude with Tory success.” In typical Phillips style, she signs off the message with a cheery kiss.\n\nJess Phillips is the 35-year-old Member of Parliament for Birmingham Yardley who famously told Diane Abbott to f*** off.  Corbynites went on to call this racist (actually, Abbott had called the young MP “sanctimonious” for daring to question the lack of women appointments in Labour’s front bench, and as Phillips says now, “I’ll tell anyone to f*** off if they’re rude to me, is the truth”). Phillips is sparky, bolshie, a “proud parliamentarian” who got pregnant at 23, a month after getting together with Tom, a lift engineer who has since given up work to look after the kids.  (“We’d known each other for ages” she says, in between sucks on an e-cigarette.)\n\nShe worked for Woman’s Aid before becoming an MP in 2015, and has continued to bang her feminist drum in the Commons - she chairs the Women’s Parliamentary Labour Party, and on International Women’s Day last year, she stood up in the Commons and read out the names of the 120 females killed in the previous 12 months. Last autumn, she successfully campaigned for extra funding to be ring-fenced for women’s refuges. Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, congratulated her on her achievements, but her own party seemed less keen to pat her on the back, with one Corbynite blog accusing her of only ever having been a business manager at Women’s Aid (she managed the refuges).\n\nShe is not backwards about coming forwards, and has now written a funny, frank book called Everywoman, which is all about finding the courage to speak the truth. “The Labour Party needs to sit in a corner and have a word with itself,” she tells me. “It needs a smack about the face. A serious, wet fish to the chops! A shaking.” I make the observation that it seems to me that the party is behaving like a petulant teenager and she agrees. “Oh, a terrible petulant teenager -  like a child who is saying ‘I’m going to get what I want and if not I’m going to cry about it’. I think they are waking up to the fact that we are electorally in a disaster.”\n\nPhillips says that “being in perpetual, credible opposition is one thing, but being in perpetual weak opposition is just soul-destroying”. She has great friends in the Labour Party - Alison McGovern, and she was close to Jo Cox. But, she seems to have a far jollier relationship with the Tories, writing in her book about eating a packet of sandwiches in a Co-Op cafe with Jacob Rees-Mogg, “and I can confirm he did not ask for swan on wholemeal... although it is true he was the only person in a double-breasted pin-striped suit”.\n\nAre the Tories nicer to her? “Oh yeah, no doubt about it! They call me Aunt Pol [after Aunt Pol from Peaky Blinders] because she’s always smoking a fag like she’s running the joint.” She is particularly fond of Sir Nicholas Soames. “He gave me genuine dieting advice the other day. He’s half the man he was. He was telling me that you’ve got to have a boiled egg for breakfast and then throughout the day have 'Moo-lar’ yoghurts” - she says gently ribbing his posh accent - “and just chicken and salad in the evening. I thought, ‘If anyone had told me that I was going to get dieting advice from Winston Churchill’s grandson I might not have believed them.” By contrast, she has only spoken to John McDonnell “about twice”. I just don’t move in the same circles.” But you’re friends with Nicholas Soames, I say. “Well, he’s a character. So he seeks you out to tell you witty things.”\n\nHer parents - her mother was an NHS manager and her father an English teacher - gave her membership to the Labour Party when she was 14. Her \"mom\", as she calls her (this, she says, is what mums are called in Birmingham), died of cancer when Jess was about to turn 30, but the MP does not touch on her death in the book. “When I think about her I don’t ever think about her dying. She had cancer, sarcoma, but she had it in her leg, and she was being treated here in the UK for a deep-vein thrombosis.  So she was given blood thinners and stuff.“\n\nPhillips seems keen not to dwell too much on the darker details. “Then she went to France on holiday, was bitten by a mosquito and her whole leg swelled up, and then went to a French hospital, and they diagnosed her having this massive tumour in her leg. And then she had had it removed within a day on the French health service. Bear in mind my mum was an NHS manager, so if she couldn’t get the right care, God only knows what hope there is for any of the rest of us. I mean, she would have died in a ditch to defend the NHS, but it definitely had its moments with her.”\n\nThe cancer had in fact spread to her lungs; she was told she had six months to live, but paid for pioneering treatment in Germany that kept her alive for another two and a half years. “She was good for two years, but then she couldn’t walk, she was delusional… I remember the day she died, I was at work [at Woman’s Aid]  and they rang and said she’s going to die within hours, and I drove, it was about 15 miles, and I was stuck in traffic and just thought ‘I need to get home, I need to get home, my mum’s about to die’, and I pulled up outside my own house, not  Mum and Dad’s house, which was a few streets away. And then I realised, ‘It’s going to be OK. Because you’re a grown-up and when you were saying go home, you ended up where your children and your husband live. This is just life. It goes on.’ I went into proper mourning when she was diagnosed, but I think by that point I’d come to terms with it.”\n\nThe book is dedicated to her mother, as well as Jo Cox. Phillips finds it profoundly disturbing that her death seems to have changed nothing. “On the day of Jo’s special memorial, I was interviewed on Channel 4 alongside Alastair Campbell and I was saying, ‘This will change people’s attitudes.’ He said, ‘It won’t make the blindest bit of difference.’ Turns out he does know what he’s talking about, Alastair.”\n\nFor, Jess, Jo will always embody the idea of what a good politician is. \"She was an exception to the rule. But I would caveat that by saying that the people who think politicians are all in it for ourselves… well, politicians are ultimately quite private people and really nice people, they just don’t come across that way. We have to get better at appearing normal.”\n\nAnd Phillips is certainly a good starting point.\n\n","score":"20","subreddit":"ukpolitics"}

Don't use the coin sorting machines at the front of the store; those charge you 12 cents on the dollar, so for every dollar you have it sort, you'd only get back 88 cents.  You can get coin wrappers for free from your bank, or buy a large bag of them from any office supply store or even Wal-Mart for a few bucks.  If you want to splurge, get an electric coin sorter, or the one I like is the manual one that looks like a black flower pot.  It's actually four different layers, going in size from quarters down to dimes, and was I think $8 at Wal-Mart.  Sort the coins, roll them up, and deposit them into your bank account.\n\n\nSome banks offer free coin sorting for their customers, but only if you plan to deposit the money into your account.  Others will do it, but give you the option to take the cash instead.  If the total comes out to $250.89, they will hand you $250.89, instead of less 12 cents on the dollar, which would leave you with around $30 less.","score":"3","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"Honestly, I thought he did a good job in covering both sides of the issue.  I think the problem is that everyone sees what they want.  Part of the problem comes from how one imagines a \"No Go Zone.\" From perspective, it would be a lawless bombed out area like in Somalia or at least New York in the 70s or South Central LA in the 90s.  The current situation in Sweden bears little resemblance to these places and time periods.  Modern-day Charlotte or Baltimore would probably be a better comparison.  I can imagine that some in the United States might argue that Charlotte or Baltimore could be considered a no-go zone.  I used to live in a neighborhood in D.C. that might be called a No-Go zone so attaching the monocure to these places seems silly to me.  One extraordinary event does not define a city.  Personally, I alao think that it is a hard argument to make from a statistical perspective.  While high crime pockets still persist, violent crime is at a historical low and tends to be isolated to high poverty areas.  In the United States, it is still a problem that deserves disscussion but far from a crisis that impacts broad sections of the population.\n\nI also think that he made an eloquent point about the dangers of comparing the the situation in Sweden to the United States.  Unlike the United States, pockets of violent crime were rare in Sweden prior to the last few years.\n\nThe problem comes when people start to draw broader conclusions about the situation to fit their political ideology.  Both sides are guilty of this.  If both sides would just take a step back and look at the situation logically, I think that they would realize that there is plenty of middle ground.","score":"18","subreddit":"conspiracy"}

{"body":"In elementary school we played a team that had a girl on it (rugby league, in Australia). This was the early 90s and equal rights for women in sports was probably a hot topic, but I was 10 and just liked playing football. I also liked winning, but everyone on the team turned soft as eggs after the coach talked to us about giving her a fair go, but every touch that girl had, they would basically clear a path for her... That is not a fair go. At 10 my understanding was that that was not fair for anyone but her. She was scoring points, and not making any tackles on defense while she was at it... My first touch I ran straight over her, and the next time she got the ball I gave her a simple little shoulder charge, and she went toppling over into a crying heap. Off she went. The game evened up, and we ended up losing by a try. She was never seen again, I was in deep shit, and nobody on my team felt good about losing by a try when we let her walk in for 2 or 3.\n\nI'm all for a fair go and it sucks there wasn't a place in rugby league for her at that time, but every game the emaciated kid with the delusional parents still gets to run on and feel the game, and that's fair, to let somebody without the the correct tools to contribute, because they have no influence on the game... \n\nThe emaciated kid, just like the girl, soon learn they cannot take the hits to stay in the game, but modern culture is trying to take those hits out rah rah rah","score":"2","subreddit":"gifs"}

{"body":"1. They stopped being fun after the hundredth time. \n\n2. Fatebringer dominated everything in PvE, sure, but then the dark below came out, and besides I was referring to PvP. Anyone who knows anything about the PvP scene in Destiny knows that there's rotating metas - Jon wazowski or whatever the fuck his name is has admitted to that being his purpose in balancing. I can't speak as to the year 2-3 metas, but Y1 went ARs, then Handguns, then Pulse Rifles at the beginning of Y2. \n\n3. Lmao the classic defense. Grimoire lore doesn't equal story, dumbass. The story is what's in the game, or what should be in the game in destiny's case. Destiny's lore is fantastic, of course; \"Yours, Not Mine\" to Dredgen Yor or whatever is still one of my favorite lines, and I love the theory that Yor was the former owner of TLW. It's quite hilarious that destiny only has slightly more story than Overwatch, which is to say almost none, yet they both have plenty of lore. Overwatch at least has a good excuse for this. \n\n4. They get boring quick; within 100 hours or so, but the shitty grind means you have to spend far more time than that to get what you want. \n\n5. I'm aware of TWAB lmao and it's a fucking sham. 90% of the time Deej is talking about nothing in a vague attempt at communication and the other 9% he's hinting at some future underwhelming shit. 1% of the time is it actually useful. Overwatch microtransactions never affect the game in any sort of way. Can you say the same of the SPL's record book and level boosters? Moreover, Overwatch will never have paid DLC, so microtransactions are necessary for the long haul of keeping it updated. Destiny at this point has had $110 at least of DLC (note I didn't say $110 dollars worth of DLC because that shit is worth $50 at most) and it's introducing another $60 game with more paid DLC tomorrow. They're not even close to being comparable. \n\n6. I'm well aware of that lmao. Though \"ton\" is overstating it. I'm pretty sure the area in \"Assault on the Control Room\" alone is a significant percentage of the entire area in Destiny. I'm thinking 30% of the Dreadnaught. I was merely comparing the PvP section of Destiny to Overwatch, even thought it barely qualifies as a comparison. ","score":"2","subreddit":"Overwatch"}

{"body":"Ah, but the cost to produce Bitcoin increases because more people mine them. So the cost to produce Bitcoin increases as the difficulty rises. This has been true when it was CPU mined, and GPU mining kernels were written. The hashing power increased 10x, but the cost didn't increase - GPU mining is more electricity-efficient than CPU mining. Similarly, ASIC mining is more efficient than GPU mining electricity-wise (although you do have to buy hardware for it).\n\nBut it remains true that Bitcoin (GPU) mining has always been just marginally profitable. Basically, if you were paying residential electricity rate you were breaking even. This is why the difficulty would go down when the price dipped - the people in the US that were paying a marginal electricity price of $0.35 / kWh would just stop mining. This is because it became more profitable to just BUY the coins you were going to mine instead of wasting your time.\n\nSometimes the price would go up so high that people ran out of second hand 5750s to buy and then it was profitable for everyone to mine and the difficulty couldn't possibly raise fast enough. But when it crashed I would find myself in a position where it was actually a waste of money to mine unless your electricity cost was lower.\n\nI didn't buy an ASIC, but the same thing happens with older miners that aren't as energy efficient that people run in their house. It's only profitable when the price is going up and the difficulty hasn't adjusted yet. When the price drops and the difficulty adjusts it becomes less profitable, so they probably turn them off (although not everyone micromanages this much).","score":"1","subreddit":"Bitcoin"}

{"body":"Well, Blender is a hot mess of a program. It doesn't follow even basic OS functionality. Max is quite easy to learn because the way you use the operating system is the same way you control Max. If I want to click on something, I just do the same thing I do in Windows. Blender, on the other hand, is free software, and all free software tends to suffer from these kinds of problems; they never had to be polished or optimized. Bother will give you the same result if given enough time, but professional software like Max is more likely to get you there while you still have hair.\n\nThat's the other thing. Blender is for hobbyists. It's fine software and I've seen some amazing work. But Max, Maya, and the like are professional software. It's like using MS Paint or Photoshop. One is far more marketable than the other, regardless of the work you are able to product. And if you are working in animation or modeling, you're more likely to cross paths with Max than Blender.\n\nThat being said, don't forget that what you know about modeling and animation is transferable. Knowing how to fine tune a model in Max isn't that different from Blender. Mesh is still made of polys and vertices, and concepts like edge flow are the same, regardless of the software you use.\n\nLastly, the more you know, the better you'll do. If you only know one way to do something, you will only ever know that one way. If you only walk home along this one street, you'll never meet the people a block over or stop by that corner store up the street. And if someone new moves to the neighbourhood, you'll never be able to give them a tour. If you only know Blender, you only know the way things are done in Blender, and your experiences is limited. If you know how to use other software too, you can learn different ways to do things, which tools are better for what task, and how to shift your perception so that you can think of a problem from another angle. That is perhaps the biggest reason to try Max.\n\nAlso, your job. That's probably a big one too.","score":"4","subreddit":"3dsmax"}

{"body":"I have some issues with this article. First of all none of the historical ideas presented ever really qualified as science, even in their own time, and I do not buy the notion that \"the amazing theories were scientific and entirely reasonable\". There never was any scientific evidence for the Doctrine of Signatures or the Mysterium Cosmographicum or Preformationism and they were never good models for explaining anything.\n\nSecondly, people do not use concepts from abstract algebra and category theory in programming and programming language design because they subscribe to \"Pythagorean number mysticism\". They do it because they provide useful abstractions in practice. Monads are not used because they make the program more \"mathy\", but because they provide a common abstraction for things like lists, exceptions, stateful computation and null pointers. The thing is, programs are basically just applied math. Whatever language we use to describe them is just a thin veneer over that fact. We can argue whether \"repeat\" is a better keyword than \"for\", but this is like arguing whether Leibnitz' notation is better than Newton's notation for differentials.\n\nFinally, I find it a bit ridiculous to compare programming language design with biology or astronomy.

{"body":"So a bit more math:\n\n1 AF = ~43,500 ft^3, so 7500 ft^3 /sec will empty the reservoirs of ~15,000 AF. At these flows, it will take ~4 months to get rid of all the water. That assumes not another drop of precipitation falls this winter, and the reservoir levels don't change (they'll be 100% full in June, not 50% like now) so flows will probably not go down below 5000 for 3 or 4 months, and may go higher yet. \n\nIn May of 2012, the river was at ~8100 CFS for about a week. The 100 year flood plain is ~ double that flow rate. It won't come close to that this year. The highest the river has run since 1955 when Lucky Peak was finished was just under 10,000 CFS in 1983. My guess is this year won't see flows in excess of 9,000, but predictions are hard, especially about the future.\n\nedit: they're currently releasing 8100 CFS from the reservoir and 2300 CFS are flowing in (from melt and rain). so the net is that they're releasing is 5800. So if they need to release 2 MAF, and another 0.5 MAF falls during the rest of the winter/spring, it will take 6 months for the river to drop from it's current level.

What you're saying is that every user that has come forward and claimed to have been banned does not want to show this publicly? I'm sorry man, this just doesn't sit right with me. Granted I'm speculating, but hell since there has been no evidence posted we really have no choice do we? I can't imagine for one second that you guys would not provide proof that a bunch of users were banned. It would be awesome sauce and would really shine a light on Spez and r/Seattle because it would be pretty easy to figure out who the honey pot is/are, \"obviously you can't reveal the honeypots, at least on Reddit due to rules but there is nothing stopping you guys from posting the ban notices.\" I guess what I'm saying is that I can't figure out what, if any privacy concerns there would be unless there is more to the story that we are not being told.

There’s more rodent poop remnants and insect fragments in there. Of course we can’t dismiss risk just because the dose is so small. There are chemicals, botulin from the Botulinim clostridium bacterium for example, that are toxic at even lower doses. The reason we can dismiss 10 milligrams of azodicarbonamide, is that the toxicity of the compound has been extensively studied. Yes, it has shown toxicity in dogs when fed at levels of about 5-10% of their diet. The percent of the human diet this chemical makes up is so trivial that it cannot even be calculated. As far as the asthma connection goes, well, that refers to inhaling the powder in an occupational setting. It has absolutely nothing to do with the trace amounts in bread. And the fact that azidocarbonamide is used in the manufacture of some plastics and the soles of shoes? Another scientifically bankrupt argument. Salt is used to melt ice on the street. That doesn’t mean it is dangerous in food.","score":"3","subreddit":"canada"}

They have *no* intention of helping, merely getting men to shut up and take it. The easiest way to do that is to feign concern. Hence \"concern trolling\" was coined.\n\nHave you ever noticed the only thing feminists and anti- people do is concern troll, shame, and call people \"nice guys?\"  \n\nHave you ever noticed how \"nice\" became a pejorative?  What the fuck kind of society are these people trying to create....one where they are in power and have control. And if people talk about how shitty they are, then they might not have control because their entire thing is about projecting the image of being forward-minded and intelligent and tolerant. Hence the \"concern\" if not outright shaming and false equivalencies. If someone pointed out they aren't what they say they are, then they might be held accountable, and *nothing* is worse than being held accountable.\n\nWomen are never to be held responsible for their behavior.

Take what you are given, make the most of it, and stop whining.\"\n\nThat's the thing, there is no meaningful distinction between these two statements. They both boil down to them simply not caring; \"Maybe the deck is stacked, but I don't care\". Again, that's fine, it's their prerogative. There's just no point in charades to try and pretend that it's anything but that. If they know that some people are \"dealt\" shitty hands, they simply don't give much of a shit about it. It's not about merit, it's not about responsibility, it's about it not being their problem; hence the focus on self improvement. It works well within the narrative and allows them to wash their hand clean of whatever problem arise. If it works out, *see it was possible all along*, if it doesn't, *well too bad they didn't work hard enough*. \n\nThat article is a great illustration; what is the problem here ? Entitled needy people, of course, which weight so so heavily on the state with their neediness (did I hear corporate welfare ? Well of course not...). How can they accept that dejection ? What happened to our moral rectitude of old ? Is there a word, maybe, about how the economy might have changed between the 1960's and now, aside from the obvious moral decay I mean ?

Not just Brynden Tully either (though he was probably best in this area), but several others too. Roose Bolton who (discounting his later beytrayal) has always been portrayed as clever and dangerous. The Greatjon who, while not exactly the intellectual type, would being experience to the table and know how battles are fought. And guys like Jason Mallister and Tytos Blackwood who we only hear positive things about, as well. And that isn't even all of them.\n\n\n  Basically I think Robb was quite a good battle tactician... especially given his age and inexperience and had the potential to be one of the greats in this area if he had lived. But I think the Blackfish and other members of the war council played a huge part in his successes too. And on the opposite side, Robb was a terrible at *strategy* and politics. He shows no real vision for the long-term and he fucks up everything because of his lack of political savvy and concern for grand strategy. Tywin, on the other hand, was a great strategist and politician, but an average tactician at best from what we see. But this is exactly why he wins in the end. ","score":"2","subreddit":"asoiaf"}

{"body":"\u0026gt;I wonder if I will ever have 5 minutes on planet where I do not feel like an alien visitor. \"Genuine brand experiences?\" Seriously?\n\n\u0026gt;\"Sharing ideas and being entertained....\" in retail spaces?\n\n\u0026gt;I acknowledge there are undoubtedly people who want this, but I will never understand that. Near-total liberation from retail environments is one of my favorite effects of the information age, and on the rare occasion I have to go into a store (other than for groceries), it is inevitably a terrible experience.\n\nIt's a wild coincidence that today I read about the opening of the new Jordan Marsh Department Store in downtown Boston. (Jordan Marsh was later bought out by Macy's in the 1990's, but was a large and famous store in New England / Northeast.)\n\nThe industry seems cyclical.\n\nSears was the be-all and end-all of shopping, doing so via catalog. It expanded to brick and mortar, and is now being replaced by Amazon, which is essentially an online catalog.\n\nJordan Marsh used to be a destination department store, then expanded to \"satellite stores\" in the suburbs, and now stores like it are trying to reel it back in to flagships stores worth visiting.\n\nAnyway, the read about Jordan Marsh was fascinating mostly because of the history and sense of civic pride it inspired:\n\n\u0026gt;Early on Jordan Marsh gained the reputation of being a good corporate citizen. Soon after the start of the Civil War, the store held a special flag raising ceremony on the roof of its building. Thousands gathered in the street below to cheer. Then Jordan's opened the city's first recruitment center in the main lobby of the store. **Eben Jordan also promised to any employee who would enlist a free uniform, his full salary while serving, and a guarantee of his job on return.** At the end of the war, Jordan Marsh presented a National Peace Jubilee — one of the grandest spectacles the city had ever seen.\n\nThen\n\n\u0026gt;After World War II, as the nation rebounded with new hope and economic vigor, the management of Jordan Marsh announced that it would build a new store in downtown Boston.\n\n\u0026gt;Jordan's five older buildings would give way to a new building that would take up a full city block. Covering an area larger than Harvard Stadium, it would have two stories under ground; another 14 would rise into the air. It would have all the latest technology, including air conditioning, automatic doorways, block-long show windows, and radiant-heated sidewalks.\n\n[SOURCE](http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=95)","score":"1","subreddit":"news"}

Sure, they say the odds of it are extremely slim and may personally reject it, but there is nothing to completely rule out the possibility.  Because the possibility of an occurrence taking place is small does not mean we can rule it out entirely.  Science would also tell you it's impossible for a man to rise from the dead and ascend into heaven.\n\nIn terms of 6-day creation, it's a valid viewpoint in the Church, though it in itself is scientifically highly unlikely.\n\nEvil existing in the world before the fall is a question that has been brought up before.  Matt Fradd answered it [here](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/was-there-death-before-the-fall).  Death surely existed before 'the fall,' but it only would have applied to plants and animals.  When God granted humans an immortal soul, THEN they would have been freed from all pain, suffering, and death (the gifts of Original Holiness and Original Justice).  When we say Adam and Eve's sin caused 'sin and death to enter the world,' we are referring specifically to humans.  What the Bible does not specify is the time from Adam and Eve's creation and their first sin.

GDP economics show a government how much strain an economy can support, so most first world countries are no longer at risk of hyperinflation with direct control. Also, the currency is not based on a gold standard anymore, so printing money doesn't directly increase the price of goods. It is solely based on merchant costs, notably the cost of a barrel of oil in US dollars. In other words, quantitative easing does not cause inflation because the price of the dollar is tied to USD Saudi oil prices.

You shouldn't have to have a panic attack the moment the match starts because some cunty Bandit or Jager is going to hop out a window and headshot half your team the moment Prep ends. \n\nThere's no feeling of approaching the objective as a team anymore, and there's no feeling of defending it as one either.

Unit grade works different in Wonder Tactics.\n\nThere are 1 to 6 natural star units, but in SW terms 6-star units are more like powerful 3-stars. In WT, you can summon legendary heroes (with orange-colored stars) with legend scrolls or rarely via normal summons and random evolutions. They will appear as anywhere from 4 to 6 star forms. They are all the same unit, it's just that they can initially show up for you in their base 4-star form or if you're lucky they can come pre-evolved to 5 or 6 star.\n\nLegendary heroes are equivalent to very good Nat4's in SW. The cream of the crop Nat5 units of Wonder Tactics are mythical heroes, and you can only get them with a slim chance from legendary scrolls, and have only 1 per team.\n\nPS: I don't know how WT's tutorial progression goes now since I started the game quite a while ago, but you will get a number of free heroes as rewards for clearing story mode or completing other tutorial quests.

{"body":"**Hallingan** - The Hallingans have no real codified war cries. They will generally have their bards and poets prepare a custom warcry before battle. Hence, they change with every battle, and are intended to cause the most distress or embarrassment to the enemy.\n\n**Moorennan** - The Moorennan war cry is fairly complex. The main one they use is \"*With Bronze Blade and Stone Heart!*\" This reflects the fact that Moorennans still use hardened bronze rather than the more standardised steel found in the rest of the world.\n\n**Bragosi** - The Bragosi really don't have much in the way of war cries, since they don't really have much in the way of an army or navy. They mostly employ mercenaries from Bistyn.\n\n**Notrethar** - The common Notrethar War Cry is \"*For the Bay!*\" This references the fact that they believe themselves to be the true rulers of the Trethar bay.\n\n**Sutrethar** - The common Sutrethar War Cry is \"*King, Honour, Duty!*\" \n\n**Arodoi'i** - The Arodoi'i don't generally use war cries. They just stay silent on the battlefield, muskets in hand and cannons brought up to the front.\n\n**Kandey** - The Kandey War Cry differs depending on what part of the army you're facing. If you're facing the part of the army made up mostly of men loyal to the Holy Priest, then you will have chanting of both Dualicist hymns and national hymns. However, the other part of the army, that loyal primarily to the King, will shout \"*For King, For Faith, For Country!*\"\n\n**Bistyni** - The Bistyni mercenary companies all have different war cries, all mostly reflecting the nature of the company in question. However, they do have one chant of \"*Oo-ey!*\" which they almost ritualistically chant in unison to scare an enemy.\n\n**Yhafirossa** - The Yhafirossa navies often chant \"*For the Island-King!*\" when facing an enemy of Yhafiros itself, but when acting as privateers for other countries, the chant of \"*Dignity and Valour!*\" is much more common.\n\n**Herri** - The armies of An-Herra often chant national hymns. A popular one is the song 'For my loyalties, there is naught but An-Herra'.\n\n**Onghol** - Most Onghol raiders just scream their own insults at the enemy, hoping the noise will dishearten them.\n\n**Srasain** - The Srasain are excellent Guerilla warriors, so don't use  chants very often as they give away their position.","score":"1","subreddit":"worldbuilding"}

{"body":"Jon, the Lord Commander, and Artos stood in a circle over the wight's head that Cybderdyne had lopped off. Though its body was now a pile of ash, the eyes still roved around the room and the teeth gnashed together in impotent rage. \"That's Othor,\" Artos said. Jon and Mormont stayed silent; they'd known the identity already. \"How... what...\"\n\n\"Is this what you meant?\" Jon asked Cyberdyne. Unlike the others, the Terminator had no interest in the still-moving head. He simply stood at attention by the door awaiting new orders. \"Is this what you were meant to protect me from?\"\n\n\"Possible,\" the Terminator answered. \"I am unfamiliar with this model, but it is possible that Skynet has segmented its data banks for security purpose and I was not given access to these files. However, unless the model's power source is contained within the head, I expect it to stop moving soon.\"\n\nJon gaped at Cyberdyne. Only about half of those words made any sense to him.\n\n\"It's been a long day,\" Lord Commander Mormont said as he threw a sheet over the head of his former Brother. \"I think we're all a little tired.\" Apparently he hadn't understood it either, which was comforting to Jon. \"Jon, please find some food and accomodations for our guest, and...\" his eyes looked the Terminator up and down, \"and some fitting clothing, if you can.\" \n\n\"I do not require food,\" Cyberdyne answered. \"My reactor fuel cell is running at peak efficiency. I do, however, need to undergo some repairs.\" He pulled the remains of his shirt to the side, revealing the wound on his shoulder.\n\nMormont shook his head. \"Of course!\" In all the excitement and confusion, they'd nearly forgotten that their new friend had been sliced to the bone. The scraps of clothing around it covered up just how severe it really was. \"You need medical attention! Artos, please wake Maester Aemon and bring him to treat Cyberdyne.\"\n\n\"We'll be in the spare room two floors down,\" Jon informed Artos, who disappeared through the door. Then he turned back to Cyberdyne. \"Are you able to walk?\" It was kind of a silly question, given that Cyberdyne was still standing. \n\n\"Yes, I am fine,\" it answered. \"I am capable of self-repair, given the proper equipment.\"\n\nJon led him out of the Lord Commander's quarters. \"I guess our first stop would be the storerooms, then.\" They descended down the narrow hallway, so low that Cyberdyne had to stoop in order to walk. \"Tell me,\" Jon said. \"Where are you from? I've never heard anyone speak the way you do.\" During his time at Winterfell they had had Lords and Ladies visit from the far reaches of Skagos to the islands off the coast of Dorne and everything in between. But none of them ever spoke like Cyberdyne.\"\n\n\"I was fabricated near Los Angeles,\" the Terminator answered.\n\nJon thought back to his father's map room in Winterfell. He'd spent many an hour there at Ned's feet, learning battle strategy and politics alongside his brother Robb. And he'd studied the maps enough to have memorized every town and city and castle labeled on it. He couldn't recall any named Los Angeles. Perhaps it was too small to be included on the map. \"And what House do you owe fealty to?\"\n\nCyberdyne did not answer immediately. \"I do not comprehend the question,\" it finally responded. \"Please define 'House.'\"\n\n\"You know...\" Jon said. He'd never really thought anyone wouldn't understand the concept. Even the tribes along the Stony Shore understood their place under House Stark. \"Who rules Los Angeles?\"\n\n\"Skynet,\" Cyberdyne answered. \"At least, it did at the time of my departure.\"\n\n\"Hmm...\" Again, Jon thought back to the lessons with his siblings. \"House Skynet?\" he never recalled learning about such a house, but perhaps it was one of those barren rocks out on the Iron Islands that fancied themselves a proper House even with just a dozen or so subjects. Theon had been the only ones who ever remembered those. \"And do you belong to this house?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Cyberdyne said. \"I was created by Skynet and were the legal system still intact I would be considered its property.\"\n\nJon laughed. \"*Created* is a good way of putting it.\" He considered whether Cyberdyne was admitting to being a bastard, but didn't want to push the point. Some people are sensitive about that sort of thing. \n\nThey arrived at the storerooms and the armory. It was empty but for Donal Noye, hammering away at the red-hot blade of a knife. He glanced up and rolled his eyes as he saw Jon enter, but did a double-take as the enormous form of Cyberdyne ducked under the doorway. \"By the Smith's hand!\" he gasped, setting down his work and approaching for a closer look. \"Who is this, then.\"\n\n\"Donal Noye, meet Cyberdyne of House Skynet.\" The two shook hands, causing Cybderdyne's shoulder to spark a bit. \"He needs some supplies, he says. Saved me and the Lord Commander getting that wound there, so let's do whatever we can to help him, eh?\"\n\nDonal just nodded; he was still a little stunned by the muscular giant in front of him. \"Sure,\" he said. \"Whatever you need, it's yours. And I know this place like the back of me hand, so just ask.\"\n\nCyberdyne glanced around, perhaps looking to see what was available. \"Soldering iron,\" he said. \"Pneumatic diagnostic kit. Plastic-wrapped copper wire. Standard surgical tool set...\"\n\n\"Err...\" Donal hadn't understood any of that. \"How about you just have a look around, then?\" Cyberdyne nodded and headed off to a corner to begin his search. \n\n\"What's 'is story?\" Donal whispered to Jon. \n\n\"He just showed up, naked at the gates according to Artos.\" Jon said. \"And good thing he did, too. Othor's corpse came to life again and attacked me and the Lord Commander. If Cyberdyne here hadn't been there, I don't think we would have made it.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Donal said, watching Cyberdyne shufle through all of their equipment. \"Seems like a handy fellow to have in a fight. We ought to keep 'im around. Maybe get him a weapon?\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" Jon said. Castle Black was supposed to be safe, but when the dead come back to life... well, who knows? \"Cyberdyne,\" Jon called to him. \"What is your weapon of choice?\"\n\nCyberdyne was busy unraveling a set of bright copper chain mail, but looked up from his work. \"Phase plasma rifle, automatic fire,\" he answered. \n\nJon and Donal exchanged a confused look. \"Let's just start with a sword,\" Jon said.\n\n------\n\nRemember to subscribe here to /r/Luna_Lovewell for possible continuations and tons more stories!\n\nAnd if you **really** like it, you can [consider donating on Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/Luna_Lovewell)","score":"600","subreddit":"Luna_Lovewell"}

GFE's will likely get fixed as they play more games. Team 8's problem will naturally fix itself when they are on more big stages.\n\nLikely B Step will overtake Tempo Storm.

He recognises that his missions have been leading up to a moment of potential vengeance, but it is meaningless. Killing them achieves nothing, and it certainly doesn't undo whatever they've done to earn Ezio's ire.

{"body":"Ok folks, two Foci going 60MPH in opposite directions performing an elastic collision have the same energy as one Focus at 120MPH hitting a stationary object.\n\nThe difference comes about in the coefficient of restitution. A coefficient of 1 is a perfectly elastic collision, meaning that the object bounces away with the same energy it had immediately before the impact. A coefficient below 1, but greater than 0 is most common in real life, and determines the distance of the bounce between objects.  A coefficient of zero is when object A embeds itself within Object B (a bullet shot into a block of ballistic gelatin, for example.)\n\nThis vid doesn't give us a great way to measure the amount of bounce, but in a two car collision perfectly head on it would likely be very close to 0, so all of the energy goes into each car and their occupants.\n\nSo yes, this is a perfectly valid test, stop saying no Focus will get to 120MPH.","score":"2","subreddit":"interestingasfuck"}

But her remarks do seem a little weird.  They don't seem to have any traction within the feminist community though; sharia law isn't really on our radar.\n\nDonna Hylton's involvement in that ransom thing is disturbing to say the least, but she served her time, I suppose.\n\nAnd... I gotta be honest, that opinion piece on Odeh seems extremely biased against the women's march on principle.  It makes it hard for me to believe the things the author is saying at face value; they clearly have an agenda, and it is an editorial, not an article.\n\nThis is why I'm glad feminism is a decentralized movement, though.  We can ignore the other prejudices and flaws in the individuals who organize the movement, because what results is singular in purpose.  The Women's March did nothing to enforce sexist sharia law or to torture real estate brokers.  I'd say the vast majority of participants pay no attention to who these people are, and they don't have to.  \n\nIdolization of a central figure is dangerous and unhelpful in any movement, so it's nice to see that the feminist movement as a whole hasn't fallen into that trap.\n","score":"1","subreddit":"JonTron"}

Strange how it's so well accepted that other species can show all sort of differences between their genders, but as soon as it's human beings, suddenly they must be exactly the same. The idea that they are the same is the actual construct.\n\n2. Gender and division of roles was good enough to allow the human race to survive through many tough times, which is all evolution cares about. Technology has reached the point where we have the *luxury* of greater freedoms. Which still isn't proof that gender roles are 100% obsolete. Women certainly still in general expect men to adhere to some of their roles, such as making the first move and paying for dates, for example.\n\n3. Probably the ideal was three generations of a family living together. Instead, we've progressed beyond the nuclear family to single parents and broken homes, which research has shown does on average impact the future prospects of the children in a negative way.\n\n4.

They are mostly used as storage these days. \n\nI have to say that the preparations we had during the cold war are extremly impressive for such a small country and population. In under 24h we could raise 800 000 (largest standing army in Europe at time) men with full equippement. That is 1/10 of our entire population at the time. We had dug down a big chunk of our industry in the mountains to the north so volvo, and other companies could keep producing their wares during war.

Under Stockholm there is a large bunker (a storage these days) that was built to survive nuclear war and it could house 10 000 people.

The other judges interpreted this to be the case of the trucker in question, because he removed the trailer (which was frozen and unsafe to drag along) before driving (and, therefore, was refusing to operate the intact truck) to safety so as not to succumb to hypothermia, yet was still fired. Here, he read the law literally instead of interpreting it reasonably based on the obvious intention of the law: to protect the safety of workers and prevent their firing for trying to stay safe.\n\nEdit: changed \"failed to leave out\" to \"failed to mention.\"","score":"6","subreddit":"politics"}

And I'm a bit behind on the latest releases, so these probably aren't really the \"best\" on Linux, but ones that have impressed me at least...\n\nShadow of Mordor has an amazingly detailed open world that you can just get lost in for hours. The orcs, castles, magic, and landscapes are the perfect depiction of the fantasy worlds that I could only imagine when reading the books when I was younger. Mad Max fits the bill too, it's a more bleak world but it still pulls you in.\n\nF1 2015 is probably the most realistic game I've played, especially when it rains and you see the drops hitting the circuit. And as an F1 fan, I love seeing the cars and circuits so realistically reproduced, it feels like I'm behind the wheel of a real car. (DIRT Rally looks like it steps the realism up further, but I haven't had a chance to try this yet).\n\nBorderlands 2 may not have the most 'stunning' graphics by today's standards, but it has such a unique style and amazingly designed world. It really brings the game to life, and almost makes the game more immersive than many more realistic games. Bioshock Infinite and Life is Strange fit this description too.\n\nAnd it's not all about 3D graphics. Bastion, Transistor, and the Shadowrun and Trine series all show that sometimes the most immersive worlds come from hand crafted 2D graphics. They have some really unique and cool settings that would be hard to replicate effectively with top of the line 3D graphics.\n\nThe \"correct\" answer is probably Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, the videos look amazing.

{"body":"Honestly this is the worst place to ask for a build. You'd be much better off going to a boutique builder and inquire about a build for the specific programs you're using. \n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean you need to buy your PC from a builder, but at the very least you'll get different quotes and different builds that'll give you a good idea of what you should get. \n\nIf you don't know what you're getting in the professional market, then I'd urge that you SHOULD take the time to learn the ins and outs of the programs you're using. Like how 3DS MAX leverages from the extra processing power of Dual Xeon set-ups and actually make a huge impact on render times. \n\nThe other builds I currently see in this thread were probably made on assumptions from the three guys who just thought they could make up something good by tossing together a PCPartpicker list. \n\nYou see how neither of the three builds in this thread have any specific explanations for the parts they listed for the programs you're actually using? Ryzen offers good value for your money, but a dual or single Xeon set-up would be miles ahead better. Of course I highly doubt any of the two posters who made builds in this thread even bothered doing some research. Not bashing on these two guys specifically but literally most contributors do this. They'll just post a build that \"they think will do it\" and give it their best guess like rolling dice instead of doing research and being better well informed. \n\nHell these freaking people didn't even really touch on how you wanted 10TB of storage that's preferably SSD and any problems that might arise given the budget. /facepalm\n\n**I hate how contributors in this sub would rather resort to assumptions instead of doing some fucking research on the programs the OP is listing. With this level of laziness and stupidity it's literally like walking into a best buy.** \n\nI can give you some recommendations based on what people are saying about the program's you're using. But the rest you can figure out on your own or if you really want you can come ask me for help. \n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n* For 1825~ British pounds you could get an Intel Xeon E5-2699 V4 22 Core/44 Thread CPU with 55MB of L3 Cache a base clock of 2.2Ghz and a boost clock of 3.6Ghz. You can see the product page [here](https://ark.intel.com/products/91317/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2699-v4-55M-Cache-2_20-GHz). \n* Liquid cooling doesn't belong in workstations. You're looking at a dual tower heatsink like the Noctua NH-D15 or whatever suits your fancy. \n* Motherboard wise you're looking at a WS(Workstation) ASUS X99 motherboard. The Asus X99-E WS is pretty good. \n* Memory wise you don't need ECC memory. 2133Mhz Standard DDR4 ram is good enough. Xeon's don't support OC'd memory. \n* For storage, literally a 10TB SSD Array is impossible for your budget. A single 4TB Samsung 850 EVO alone is going to cost you somewhere in the neighborhood of [1200 British pounds](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/kTYWGX/samsung-850-evo-4tb-25-solid-state-drive-mz-75e4t0bam). You do the math and for 3 of these you're easily looking at more than half your budget for just the SSDs. You'll need to re-plan your build and think about what you're going to do. You either raise the budget if the SSD's aren't that important or you skimp on your other components if they are more important. \n* With Graphics cards it's really a toss up. Considering you can buy a GTX 1080 for nearly 400 British Pounds and a GTX 1080Ti is at 700 British pounds the GTX 1080 might have better value. The GTX 1080 Ti costs almost twice as much as a GTX 1080 despite being only 25-30% more powerful. So technically speaking in RAW compute performance, two GTX 1080s would give you more value than two GTX 1080 Ti's overall. \n* For power supplies you're looking at 80+ Titanium. Either EVGA's T2 line-up of power supplies or Corsair's AX series of power supplies. Don't even really get why you'd even think of getting any lesser power supplies with this budget. For two graphics cards I'd use an 850 Watt power supply. If you intend to load in a lot of hard drives then I'd step it up for 1000 Watts. \n\nAgain, these are just some rough recommendations based on the programs you're using. There still isn't enough information to make a build catered to your needs. As a builder, I know we've BARELY scratched the surface on specifics here around your build if I was building a workstation for you. \n\nYou pay builders a standard fee for them building you a system not just because they're building it for you, but because you're also paying for the time and effort required to gain the knowledge on specific things in the market. DIY is literally the worst route with workstations if you don't know what you need to get given your budget. **For 5000 British pounds I wouldn't fucking build or buy something without doing my own research. I don't want you to end up making a $5,000 mistake because some plebs who could click and drop parts into a PC parts picker list gave you a build based on half baked or incorrect knowledge.**\n\nAs always if you have any questions or concerns feel free to let me know.

{"body":"You are correct. I'm surprised how long this discussion has gone without anyone giving the correct answer. You should look at something called proper velocity. Normal \"coordinate\" velocity is distance traveled over time, with both measured from the same reference frame. Proper velocity is distance measured by a stationary frame divided by proper time, which is time experienced by the moving frame. Proper velocity has no limit and approaches infinity as coordinate velocity approaches c. It is equal to the Lorentz factor multiplied by the coordinate velocity. In this case, the proper velocity is about 70.7c. So, from the travelers on the ship, the trip to Alpha Centauri would take about 3 weeks. This is because at that velocity, the distance between Earth and AC is about 70 times smaller (so about 3 light-weeks), and you're traversing it at nearly the speed of light.\n\nIn this sense, FTL travel is possible after a fashion for the traveler.

{"body":"This is an excellent answer, I'll tack on a bit about backend languages. They tend to be region specific in demand so look at your local job boards, but to hit a few big ones. \n\nIf you work in frontend you probably have a decent grasp of JavaScript(or you really really should) from that node is pretty easy to grasp, since it is just JavaScript with a few server oriented modules subbed in. The ecosystem for it is huge and takes time to get comfortable with, but at its core understanding the language and the event loop model are enough to get you started. \n\nYou should learn php, it's not the new hotness, few people really love it, but it runs a huge percentage of the web. If you work in backend you will more than likely run across projects that require it. Google and php.net are your friend there is a wealth of knowledge about the language floating around out there. \n\nIf you want to work in enterprise/corporate .net is a good thing to know, I tend to live in the small business/startup world so I've never picked up more than a basic understanding. It also has a ton of information and tutorials out on the web though so shouldn't be hard to pick up. \n\nRuby/rails, python/Django, elixir/Phoenix  depending on your region these might be pretty heavily represented (well probably not elixir it's just starting to take off). If so pick them up, python ruby and elixir are fun languages to work in. \n\nIf you are getting into the backend database languages also come into play pretty heavily. \n MySQL is the big one here if you know the syntax then transitioning to any other sql flavor is fairly trivial. \nFor nosql a basic understanding of how mongodb storage works is probably enough, there are plenty of other nosql solutions out there so worth researching your local job boards to see if one in particular crops up a bunch.

This year's tournament attracted 30 AI players around the world.\n\nFineArt, developed by Chinese internet giant Tencent, participated in the tournament for the first time and won all 11 games it played.\n\nIt will next challenge rising Japanese professional player Ryo Ichiriki on March 26 in an official regular competition related to the UEC Cup.\n\nGoogle's AlphaGo, which beat world-class human player Lee Sedol in March 2016, didn't join the tournament.\n\nAbout FineArt\n\nSimilar to AlphaGo, FineArt uses deep learning to study expert games. It then plays against itself, which is called reinforcement learning, to improve its capability. Games played against human players also contribute to its success.\n\nDeveloped by a team of 13 AI professionals over the course of a year, FineArt debuted on the Tencent Go website in November 2016. By March 9, 2017, it had played against over 100 renowned human players. It won 388 out of 509 games for a winning percentage of 76.23%. In its 21 matches against China's top player Ke Jie, FineArt obtained 16 victories.\n\nAccording to the FineArt team, there is no plan currently for the Chinese AI to play against AlphaGo.\n\nThe AI technology behind FineArt has a very wide prospect in application, said Tencent Vice President and head of its AI Lab Yao Xing, such as in self-driving vehicles, quantitative finance, complementary medicine, and more.\n\nAI in China\n\nChinese internet and technology giants have shown great interest in AI in recent years.\n\nBaidu\n\nThe Baidu online search engine has been investing billions of US dollars annually in AI technology. Its achievements have been listed among the 10 Breakthrough Technologies chosen by MIT Technology Review for two consecutive years.\n\nBaidu has an advantage especially in voice and image recognition, with recognition rates sitting only just below 100%.\n\nIts AI 'Baidu Brain' beat a human candidate in voice and image recognition in one episode of the Chinese version of the scientific reality and talent show, 'The Brain,' where human candidates are chosen for their exceptional brainpower. The show was broadcast on January 6 this year.\n\nThe current focus of Baidu's AI research is on self-driving vehicles, according to Baidu's CEO Robin Li.\n\nAlibaba\n\nChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has launched 'City Brain,' an artificial intelligence hub which uses big data to help build smart cities.\n\nThe core of 'City Brain' uses the ET artificial intelligence technology of Ali cloud, which can conduct overall real-time analysis of a city, automatically deploy public resources, and amend defects in urban operations.\n\nTencent\n\nTencent is relatively new in the AI area. It established its AI Lab in 2016, with 4 main research fields of machine learning, natural language processing, voice recognition and computer vision.\n\nTencent's AI research is expected to integrate with the development of its social media software such as WeChat and QQ to make them more user-friendly.\n\nencent beat Linkface, Face++, Facebook and Google in LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) Face Database last June, with a record face recognition rate of 99.65%.\n\nhttp://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-03/21/content_28624543.htm\n\nMore AI developments https://chinarecentdevelopments.wordpress.com/2017/02/01/cyberhackingai-part-3/","score":"2","subreddit":"Sino"}

{"body":"If you want to hear the classic atheist arguement- Dostoyevsky already beat Christopher Hitchens to it. 150 years ago. \n\nIf you read the Brothers Karamazov it deals with one brother Ivan- damn smart, and damn articulate, mopping the floor with his brother over the existence of God and how idiotic it would be to believe it. But see- Dostoyevsky seemed to know that the pure intellect is not all we have at our disposal as humans. Like Milton wrote about in paradise lost- raw intellect was the highest angel that fell from gods presence. It wants a totality. It wants to think it knows everything. Aka it wants to be on level with god. Problem is that everything can't be know. So it gets angry and bitter and try's to be a tyrant. Literally to set up a totalitarian view that nothing outside of the boundaries of its kingdom can be real or true or good. \n\nMelville- best American writer ever maybe. What did Ahab and his quest for the white whale symbolize. What is the damn point of all these old and outdated novels? What were they getting at?\n\nTwain- so what was he getting at when huck was thinking about turning Jim in because the Sunday school taught him he shouldn't help runaway slaves. But he thought dammit if helping Jim leads me to hell so be it. Something inside him- are real thing inside him- helped him to get at what was actually true or right. That is the purpose of real Christianity and is symbolized literally by a person who didn't do anything actually wrong getting sold out by his own friends and tortured and killed. Such is life. There is something here deep deep deeper than many people maybe considering. \n\nTolstoy- what can I say- possibly the best novelist to ever live. Russia was hit. Hard. They were the last Christian hold outs. Once they caved to secularism, on came the Bolshevik revolution followed by piles and mounds and hundreds of Olympic sized pools filled with dead bodies.

I'm worried for Catelynn because she seems very overwhelmed, to the point even where maybe she doesn't see the benefits of seeking more help. I read somewhere that change only occurs when the pain of everything being the same, becomes too big. In my personal experience, it takes a shit ton to be motivated towards getting help.

Here's my advice homie\n\nfirst off, you have to be ABSOLUTELY SURE that y'all have a really good, stable relationship. Nobody here knows exactly y'all's dynamic, even if it might be kinda harsh of her to give you this ultimatum.  But YOU know. Don't convince yourself y'all have a perfect relationship and come here just for her if you don't. If you have ANY doubt, maybe don't follow her here. I've seen a lot of couples go to the same college and break up. If you do come here for her and y'all break up, it's also not the end of the world, but you might regret not considering your other schools. But on the other hand, I've seen a lot of couples stay together! If y'all really like each other and it's not just like, comfortable, then college won't necessarily ruin your relationship. My brother and his girlfriend dated for about 2 years in high school and she followed him here and they got engaged in December SoOoOo. But I came here with a boyfriend (we just happened to both want to go here) and we only lasted like a semester into college (which was fine, having a SO in college isnt as terrible as people say if y'all like each other and my breakup also didn't ruin my life or anything) If y'all are just comfortable together, then college will probably break y'all up anyway tbh\n\nJust visit all your schools and try to pick where you would fit in the best and go there. As hard as it sounds, try your hardest to not let your girlfriend influence that. I would try not to bring it up while you're deciding so you can think about it yourself as much as you can. I guess I'm a little biased but I fucking love UT and I think even if you came here and y'all broke up you wouldn't regret the school :-) so do whatever you think is right!

I think people talk about RNG overperforming and EDG underperforming that much because they were expecting RNG to lose against TSM and EDG to win against H2K, but if you remove the assumpion that TSM is better than H2K, they performed pretty similarly.\n\nAlso it's not like NA didn't have a chance to win vs Albus nox, CLG was behind them in the standings, and H2K handily 3-0'd them.\n\nI agree tho that C9 just got unucky in comparison by having to play against koreans, and I don't think H2K or any western team would've performed better than C9.\n\nI think there's just not enough games to tell in the group stages.","score":"25","subreddit":"leagueoflegends"}

{"body":"Except the RCMP are given a disturbing amount of leeway in the interpretation of the law, to the point that they are ultimately the ones who are deciding what the law is.  They may not be officially writing the law, but they are de facto making the law.  This is inherently against the principles of a liberal democracy such as Canada.  The main issue here is that the RCMP can turn thousands of gun owners into criminals overnight (something they've already done on several occasions), and they can do this without any accountability or oversight whatsoever.  The fact you're defending this behaviour is actually quite disgusting and frankly I believe it shows a contempt for the democratic process and our rights as Canadian citizens.  If you're really this scared of guns and gun ownership, I suggest you move to Britain or somewhere.\n\n\u0026gt; Why should ideology trump expertise ...\n\nAs I've already pointed out, with in-depth examples, the RCMP has demonstrated a remarkable lack of expertise with regards to firearm knowledge and knowledge of the very laws they are SUPPOSED to be enforcing.  Tell me, who exactly is the RCMP protecting by banning 10+ capacity Ruger 10/22 mags?  Who is the RCMP protecting by banning the Blaze 47?

I spent 6 days in Paris and 4 in Amsterdam.\n\nI fucking adored Paris. I didn't enjoy Amsterdam.\n\nParis you have the best food, endless museums and attractions, and it had such an exciting feel to it.\n\nIn Paris I did:\n\nThe Lourve \nVersailles (only thing I didn't enjoy)\nThe other big museum which name escapes me\nNotre Dame (my favorite thing, just beautiful)\nSacre Bleu\nThe Montpelier I think it's called, idk huge skyscraper outside the city where you can see everything\nThe Eiffel tower\nThe Women's March/Anti-Trump protest after the inauguration around the Eiffel Tower\nWalking tour\n\nAnd more that escapes me.\n\nAs I said the food is great and the people are the nicest I found my whole trip. I can't believe Parisians have such a bad reputation for being rude to tourists. The only thing I can think of is that it's such a popular destination in the city they probably get a lot off ignorant, rude tourists and as a result are rude back. If you're decent to them they'll be nice to you. Maybe it helped I went during the off season.\n\nAmsterdam I did:\n\nThe Rijksmuseum \nVan Gogh museum\nAnne Frank house\nWalking tour\n And something else that escapes me\n\nAmsterdam is beautiful. The canals are breathtaking and the people there are nice too. It's just less...exciting. I couldn't partake in the coffee shops because of a drug test I had to do for pre-employment, and I didn't feel comfortable visiting a brothel. Unfortunately, to me, this felt like a huge part of the city and I felt like I couldn't escape it. Felt very tacky in a way and obnoxious. Imagine Vegas in a way. There was one park that I can't remember that was beautiful.\n\nI liked Amsterdam overall but of the 16 cities I went to it ranks right above Vienna as the one I enjoyed the least.\n\nSo yeah, that's my two cents. If I had your time and knew what I knew now I wouldn't do Amsterdam. I would definitely do Prague or Copenhagen  instead.\n\nYou could easily do London \u0026gt; Paris \u0026gt; Berlin \u0026gt; Prague/Copenhagen \u0026gt; Iceland. \n\nIf you have your heart set on Amsterdam then go.

No. If you're unwilling to deal with reality, then keep living in la-la-land where you can turn the tide of public opinion by talking about \"privacy\" and \"freedom\". If any significant segment in this country gave a fuck about either of those things, we would have had no blasphemy law, no S.377, and a lot of the regressive shit would have stopped already, by itself, before you were even born.\n\nSo yeah, it seems increasingly likely that Modi will take 2024. The opposition is a bunch of *dhoklas*. What *I* think of it, or *you* for that matter, is irrelevant. \n\n\u0026gt;when the problem can be solved if we did not adopt the fucking attitude that you displayed right here with this quote \n\nYou've been going through the first two stages of grief. Denial and Anger. *\"If your attitude was better, we could beat him!\"*\n\nNow you're arriving at Bargaining. *\"We can defeat him in 2019, right guys? ^right ^guys? ^^guys? \"*. No. Sorry to burst your little bubble. It seems highly unlikely. Now hurry up and reach the fourth stage: Depression. After all, Modi *is* talking about depression. It'll be good timing for you. Finally you'll get over that and Accept the fact that a country of 1.2 billion people doesn't run according to your mood, and may have priorities different to yours.\n\nOnce you reach Acceptance, maybe you'll actually be able to do something more than whining and cribbing to me about your sob-story of work and taxes.\n\n\u0026gt;This shows that you don't give a fuck about your freedom. Your freedom is ready for sale to the highest bidder, and the worst part is that they don't want to bid anything on a deadbeat like you. They will bid on those that who are open and strong enough to challenge them, go after them. \n\nLol. What are you, 12? Do you still read fairy-tales about knights in shining armor before going to sleep at night? This isn't a story, moron. In the real world, you sometimes gotta work with the people you hate, put aside your differences, join them and steer them by walking among them. People who demonstrated against Trump's election didn't get shit. People who entered his government might be able to steer him and their country away from utter disaster though. You think your hysteria and panic makes you sound \"strong\" and \"challenging\"? I already said it. It makes you sound like an infant. The government isn't a friggin *puppy* that you can stand in front of it and *assert dominance* or alpha-dog it. The government is a goddamn Tyannosaurus Rex, and if you try to alpha-dog it, it'll eat you while you're still screaming, shit you out, and forget you even existed. If you want the T-Rex to go somewhere, you set out a lamb and lure it there.  \"You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar\" and all that.\n\n\u0026gt;How easy it would be when you bank account can be locked by simply submitting a notice in court. \n\nAre you dense? Every government in every country on fuckin Earth can do that! What you just said to me was: \"How great would it be if you could do whatever you liked and nobody could take your money.\"\n\n\u0026gt;How easy it would be for them if you had no means to even get a SIM without risking your identity.\n\nWhat are you, fuckin' Jason Bourne? You can get a black-market SIM if you'd like. Or get one in your grandpa's name. Ok? You know you already submitted copies of your PAN and your Home address to them when you got your current SIM, right? Or did mom get that for you, so you're oblivious to this fact? You realize we have *real* terrorism in this country, right? The kind that like to kill as many innocent people as possible? Why don't you just gift-wrap your phone and SIM, and send it to them so they can be even less traceable. There's a fuckin' *reason* you can't get a SIM without giving ID proof. At the very least, when the next 26/11 happens, they'll be able to hunt down and put a bullet in the *mother fuckers* that got SIMs for these terrorist cocks, enabling them to kill so many of our people.\n\n\u0026gt;How easy it would be for the gobarmint to become like the Chinese, where a word of dissent amongst your peers is enough to get you thrown into a gulag.\n\nLook, you've obviously not been taught this in your grade-6 civics class, but we actually have 3 separate wings of government. The one you're throwing a tantrum about is called the *Executive* branch. Their job is to make things happen. The second one which also comes under your hysteria is the *Legislative* branch. And the third is the *Judiciary*. They're generally pretty at-odds with each other, which serves as a reasonably good system of keeping any one in check. Occasionally they'll align, and in those times, things move quickly and there are risks of excesses. Anyway, unless you think that *every single person* in this *entire behemoth setup* is *fucking retarded*, and you're the only *Genius McUnderpants* who can do it better than them all, take a breath and quit with the hysterics. Also, in case you didn't know, apparently, a few words said in anger can *already* get you thrown in the \"gulag\" - like Kamlesh Tiwari. But you don't care about *that* freedom, do you?\n\n\u0026gt;When they went after Teesta stating that she misused funds to buy wine, VCDs and earbuds, did you give a fuck? Why should you? Because you clearly don't need them to bust your balls in the process, would you?\n\nNo, I don't give a fuck about Teesta Setalvad getting into trouble for misappropriating NGO funds worth *12 Lakhs* to pay her credit-card bills for her high-maintenance lifestyle, and using additional funds worth *1.5 lakhs* for random shit her FCRA didn't give her the authority to do. What do we live in, the friggin Congo? If dipshits knowingly break the laws and rules we have in place, then we shouldn't go after them? Is that your argument? \"The eebil gormint is enforcing the law\"? Well sheeeit, we can't have that, can we?! The government shouldn't be able to do *anything* when people break the law, except send angry letters telling them to be ashamed of themselves, right? Bcuz *muh freedom*! \"I want people to be able to commit (or abet) acts of terror, cheat the taxman, use NGO's as personal slush-funds, and have zero government oversight,... bcuz that would be *scary*\". Your freedoms that you keep harping on about come with responsibilities. Your freedom ends where that of others begins. Those \"others\" created a social contract in the form a government. You don't want oversight? Wanna do what you like? Go live in a hut on the Himalayas.\n\n\u0026gt;When others speak about it, call it \"whining\", \n\nI call non-constructive hand-wringing, complaining about some travesty with no actual practical solutions aside from \"I won't tolerate [travesty]!!\" a tantrum and a whine. It's infantile. Men solve problems. Kids run to mommy or sulk in the corner. Keep sulking.\n\n\u0026gt;be the very asshole that you find everwhere who asks \"YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM\".\n\nDon't worry. I don't expect imbeciles to solve anything. I'm trying to find solutions myself, along with others who are motivated and clearheaded enough to do it, not you. I made an attempt to encourage you to join me and others in finding better ones, but you're too much of an \"edgy teenage rebel\" to be capable of contributing to any conversation that isn't about *your* freedom. So hop along and let the adults do the work. I love my freedom and I love my country. I don't need the approval of kids and imbeciles. ","score":"1","subreddit":"india"}

{"body":"My parents tell a story about this very thing that happened to them on their wedding night: This was well before the years of key cards. They rented a hotel at Holiday Inn and were laying in bed, close to falling asleep, when they hear the doorknob chattering. They look over and sure enough, the knob is turning as if someone was trying to get in. My mother (very pregnant, at this point) hissed at my father to get up and check out the situation. He (being of sound hormonal mind) threw the covers over their heads and said, \"Fuck no.\" They could still hear the knob being tampered with and peeked out of the covers just in time to see the door open and catch on the chain lock and a hand emerge between the crack in an attempt to somehow unlatch the chain. It didn't work and their would be assailant closed the door and went about his terrorizing elsewhere. They reported the incident to the front desk and were essentially dismissed as being overreacting teenagers. From what they are aware of, nobody was robbed or hurt throughout the night and they left the hotel early the next morning, cutting off their honeymoon plans. They tell us this cautionary tale every single time that one of us rents a room. I think it was probably an employee of the hotel trying to take advantage of a couple of vulnerable kids, but as you've pointed out... It could have very well have been a contractor that held on to the key. Frightening story that could have ended tragically.","score":"15","subreddit":"LateStageCapitalism"}

{"body":"I was abused as a kid/teen. Mostly emotionally, but the times it did go physical were severe. Even when I turned 18 a few months ago they still liked having control over me. They were making it hard for me to get a job. I dropped out of high school and went to a community college in hopes of more independence. It did give me a bit more but my parents still had control over almost every aspect of my life.\n\nWe got into an argument about a month ago and things escalated. My dad said I wasn't allowed to eat any of the food in the house. My mom threatened to take the little money I had away and threatened to make a false sexual abuse accusation against a former high school teacher, so I made plans to leave. My boyfriend lived in another state, so he bought me a plane ticket to come stay with him.\n\nI left home the night before my flight and my parents were trying to stop me. They knew I had a flight for the next day but they didn't know where I was going for the night. I lied to them and got in a taxi with the few possessions I could pack. I turned my cell phone off and removed the SIM because they were tracking me and threatening me. I went to a motel by the airport like 50 minutes away so I could get to the airport quickly the next day.\n\nI got to the airport like 4 hours early because I knew my parents would be there pretty early as well and I wanted to beat them. I checked in and went through security. I was wandering around the airport when I heard my name called over the intercom, saying to make my way over to the phone for a special message. I ignored it because I didn't want to talk to my mom. I was so thankful I got there before my parents. When it was time to board the flight, I made my way to the gate and my mom was there. She looked pissed. She started lecturing me and guilting me about how I must hate my sister because I made her cry all night for leaving. She took a photo of me and then she started talking about how she had the police involved, and how I was a missing person. That's how she got through security. She must have told the front desk lady about how I was \"missing\" and the police involvement.\n\nI told her that I was definitely getting on the plane. She couldn't make a scene, so she left and I boarded the plane. I am free now. Broke as a joke and living at my boyfriend's parents' house, but not abused or trapped.\n\nI have a resume made and I'm looking for a job I'm qualified for (no HS diploma). Hopefully I will go back to school when I qualify for in-state tuition where I live. My mom made the false accusation against the teacher so that's been pretty stressful, but I'm hoping he will win out in the end.","score":"88","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

One Alpha Legion Battle Barge cuts through half a dozen battle ships with ease.\n\nI haven't, but that's pathetically bad writing if so - unless the BB managed to do some Alpha Legion surprise attack crap, and even then it'd be pretty shit writing. Battleships are the strongest mass-produced human-constructed voidcraft according to the overwhelming majority of 40k lore. \n\n\u0026gt; Footsoldiers capable of outpacing most land vehicles, tearing down or through (or easily climbing) most obstacles, shrugging off small arms fire and hitting targets with superhuman precision are a massive game changer. \n\nThey have those already. If the Imperium could *fucking aim* (orbital strikes aren't actually a difficult targeting problem at all) they wouldn't need Astartes to work the hardpoints anyway.\n\n\u0026gt; One Astartes would tip the balance on any real life battlefield.\n\nNot really, no. It's certainly the intention of the authors for Astartes to be so strong that a couple of them could beat anything modern humanity had to offer, but since you mention it - 40k was written by people without any appreciation of how contemporary military systems work. If we're going to get in depth about Space Marines vs contemporary militaries, we should take it to /r/whowouldwin. For the moment, suffice it to say that while a Space Marine would be an incredibly interesting and valuable asset to any military, if you put one in the middle of Mosul he'd last a few minutes until someone noticed him and a few minutes more after that.\n\nSee, wars aren't primarily fought with foot soldiers, which was my point.\n\n\u0026gt; One Primarch (one individual) is being heralded as the potential savior of Mankind in these recent novels. \n\nYep, he sure is being heralded.\n\n\u0026gt; That is the power of these exceptional characters\n\nNope. That's the power of propaganda (in universe) and narrative (out of universe). If Guilliman has any meaningful value to the Imperium, which he does, it's because the Imperium has been trapped in indecision for many millenia and Guilliman is one person who can tie everything together because almost everyone will follow him. His value is in leadership and management; and that doesn't take any sort of superhuman intellect, really. You or I could reform the Imperium successfully if we lived there, the problem is just that nobody would listen to us. They'll listen to him.\n\n","score":"2","subreddit":"40kLore"}

ESPECIALLY since you're looking for casual sex, if there is something holding them back (nerves, shame, guilt, lies, whatever) then they aren't going to be a good casual sex partner. If they're like \"I can't do this week because I'm away but how about next thursday at 8pm at X location\" that's one thing, but anything vague like \"ohhh I'm just so busy maybe I'll get back to you,\" or canceling/waffling about plans a lot means \"I'm all talk.\"\n\nWhat I like better about the general kink community vs. other random casual dating, at least in my experience, as a group, is that they're super into enthusiastic consent, good sexual communication, making sex a really fun time, and experimenting. I didn't really want to get into anything super Dom/sub-y, I just like to be spanked and thrown around and tied up, and to occasionally do the opposite - and I found lots of what I wanted. It was a nice community where you can just be so open about your exact sexual desires and someone will be happy to fulfill them. I've only had 3 casual encounters from outside of FetLife but I've generally had really good luck with their sexual enthusiasm and that they were safe / consent-thoughtful, but I've heard really negative stories from other women dating/fucking in the wild where the man is really selfish and things like that. But FetLife is a bad \"dating site\" and isn't designed to be one - it's better for finding out where there's casual social events (eg munches) in your area to meet people.\n\n/blah blah blah Best of luck!","score":"2","subreddit":"sex"}

{"body":"Hi Jeff,\n\nHuge fan. I actually threw out this question on your Twitter feed a while ago (which I appreciate was not the best venue, but was obviously unaware of an upcoming AMA).\n\nI was re-reading 'Finch' recently, and noted missing letters sprinkled throughout the text. I hadn't noticed it in the first copy I read, and on the re-read thought initially it was a Kindle error, but then I checked on a friend's copy and noticed they were missing there, too. \n\nH, F \u0026amp; L seem to be missing from words at key points, and you'd have to be blind to miss the significance of H and F \u0026amp; L in the context of the Ambergris Universe. I can't imagine it's a coincidence, but I was wondering if there is more to the specific pattern.

You are the only person who knows what your visions are like and has the motivation to match them.  Don't fucking compare yourself, it's a trap.

Fuck online dating, find a bar that girls go to and go there everyday and when girls leave with someone there, eventually it will be you 4/5 times.

{"body":"Again, you're oversimplifying what I said.  In cases where the argument relies on the theory, and the poster explicitly states that their argument relies on the theory, then it makes sense to critique the theory, but you should also make sure to tie it back to the original argument.  Otherwise, you've refuted the theory but haven't refuted the argument.\n\nIn cases where the theory is not actually a central part of the argument, only tangentially related, you don't actually refute argument by refuting the theory.  If you're more interested in refuting the theory than engaging with the person's argument, you aren't actually debating.  You're changing the subject and not allowing the person to explore or explain their argument.  This is annoying, but it's not the worst thing you can do.\n\nThe worst, IMO, is when someone starts attempting to refute an opinion that's not actually expressed in the original post.  In most cases, I assume this happens because they think that believing in A means also believing in B (e.g. it's commonly assumed that if you believe women are oppressed, you also believe men aren't oppressed, though in many cases people's beliefs are more nuanced than that).  Less charitably, there are some people who seem to believe that everything the OP said is a more palatable facade for their real beliefs, and that by making accusations they're exposing \"the truth\".  In any case, this is not a good way to encourage debate because you aren't actually responding to what the person says.  At that point, the OP has 2 choices: stand their repeating what they said in a variety of ways trying to get you to listen, or abandoning the debate.","score":"2","subreddit":"FeMRADebates"}

Moved you to a new platform (Kaby Lake), removed the wireless card / DVD drive (can be added later, but if they aren't 100% required, I'd leave them out of the initial build to get better PC parts in general), swapped the SSD and HDD, swapped the Motherboard and RAM,s wapped the power supply. Basically, redid the build and left the GPU and case :)\nI stuck as close to $800 as I possibly could, but this would be a far better build than the FX build you had originally spec'd out. FX is just an old and archaic platform, and isn't aging super gracefully. If you could spend $800, you could easily get a Kaby Lake i5.

P90 is the hardest gun to use so everyone uses it to try and get gud with it. You don't even see pro's use it often because it's so hard to master - they don't have the time in between streaming themselves practicing spray decals and playing at championships in their local libraries. \n\nAnyway, you go rush B, shoot some nerd or get shot by some nerds then leave some shitty looking present or whatever there for the other team to find. Half the time they can't find it in time and a space missile blows it up, the other half they give birth to some electrical foetus with an umbilical cord out of their hand and open the present.

{"body":"No, it doesn't affect people who are not illegal immigrants.\n\nRespectfully, It seems my point went straight over your head. Let me try to clarify my own point first. I've separated the extension of my argument with the asterisks. Skip it if you want, it's only there for the record. It's mostly just repeating what I said before. Seriously, no harm for skipping it.\n\n*****\n\nI do not care about who commits a crime: if they are a former felon, if they are a neo-nazi, if they are an illegal immigrant. Punish the crimes that they commit, put aside who they are. That is the very basis of a fair justice system. Illegal immigration is against the law, punish the people who are breaking the law, and nothing else. That's how it should be. Fix illegal immigration, and work to reduce murder. I understand that combining these two seems to on the surface be doing just that, but that is incredibly misleading. To create a special office dedicated to murder by illegal immigrants isn't an inherently problematic thing, but it is a bad precedent to set. I don't know how many times I need to repeat it, but it doesn't matter who commits a crime. \n\nI personally don't have a problem with inequality across everyday life, in a meritocracy certain people deserve more. However, under the law, de jure unequal treatment (or that which is explicit within the law) is completely against everything I believe in.\n\nTo be clear, there is a very important distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and I certainly don't think amnesty and acceptance across the board is the correct answer.\n******\n\n\n\nThere is an idea in politics that the only thing we should worry about is what can be done. Called the Art of the Possible.\n\nSo, why shouldn't we try to focus on the larger problems? Again, I have to ask where the evidence and statistics for murder by illegal immigrants is. You are bringing in a lot of other things that I disagree with. If a problem is larger it should be dealt with first. For the most part however, criminal law should be regulated by the state. Not the federal government. Terrorism is a special kind of crime, and there's grey area and wiggle room.\n\nThat being said, if one problem is larger than another similar one (like the terrorist argument you brought up) should we not fix the bigger problem first if we are going to position one over another? Saying we can control certain things and not other things seems like an excuse for systemizing certain prejudices. I would certainly have a problem if someone attempted to weed out \"white\" terrorism over \"Islamic\" terrorism. But, if only one of the problems were to be addressed, I would want the larger one to be addressed.\n\nAlso, is it really an actual solution to just say stop illegal immigration? It seems to me the attempts by the Obama administration to improve the situation of illegals (the dream act, uh thingy) is a more concrete attempt, albeit one of a different ideology than what you probably prefer.\n\nIt seems this is simply the wrong direction to \"stop illegal immigration\", but I am no expert. If you want to get into why I think it's not a good idea on idealogical grounds, see my prior arguments.\n\nAlso, dear god this was a lot of effort to talk about a plan that is yet to be rolled out. again, I would really like to see more specifics before making up my decision.\n\nCould you give me your thoughts?","score":"2","subreddit":"AskTrumpSupporters"}

{"body":"I'm going to try and break this down in the way that makes the most sense to me in the hope of starting a discussion.\n\nTrading a 1st rounder for Jimmy G suggests that the team in question essentially will be picking a QB with their 1st round pick. The team will be on the hook for the P5 salary as stated in Jimmy G's rookie contract. This value is approximately 820k and will count against the 2017 cap in its entirety. After this one year, Jimmy will be a free agent.\n\nThese are a few of the teams that I feel are in the market for a QB and their corresponding 1st round draft positions in 2017:\n\nBrowns - 1 \u0026amp; 12, 49ers – 2, Bears – 3, Jets – 6, Texans – 25\n\nI want to make this a practical exercise by examining QB contracts from last year's draft in similar positions. We have Goff at the 1st pick, Wentz at the 2nd, and Paxton Lynch at 26. Here are the terms of their contracts. The numbers will obviously be different for 2017 QB’s since the salary cap increases but I’m trying to illustrate a general idea (values are rounded):\n\nJared Goff\n\nYear   Base   Signing   Roster   CapHit   DeadMoney\n                                                       \n2016  450k   4.63m    ------     5.1m     27.0m\n\n2017  1.70m 4.63m    ------     6.3m     22.8m\n\n2018  2.99m 4.63m    ------     7.6m     16.5m\n\n2019  4.26m 4.63m    ------     8.9m     8.90m\n\nCarson Wentz\n\nYear   Base   Signing   Roster   CapHit   DeadMoney\n                                         \n2016  450k   4.40m    ------     4.8m     26.2m\n\n2017  1.66m 4.40m    ------     6.1m     21.8m\n\n2018  2.88m 4.40m    ------     7.3m     15.7m\n\n2019  4.09m 4.40m    ------     8.5m     8.49m\n\nPaxton Lynch\n\nYear   Base   Signing   Roster   CapHit   DeadMoney      \n                                                    \n2016  450k   1.27m    ------     1.7m     7.88m\n\n2017  880k   1.27m    ------     2.2m     6.61m\n\n2018  1.31m 1.27m    ------     2.6m     4.46m\n\n2019  1.74m 1.27m    ------     3.0m     1.87m\n\nAll of their 1st year cap hits will be significantly greater than that of Jimmy G (820k v 5.1m, 4.8m, 1.7m). Now, a common argument is that Jimmy will need to be paid after his first year, thus making his team’s financial situation worse off than if they drafted a QB. I want to examine that further because it can go a few different directions.\n\n1.) Jimmy G plays really well and the team in  question has found their franchise guy. They will most likely sign him to a long term deal at market rate and everyone is happy. This is the ideal scenario.\n\n2.)Jimmy has an average to below average year and the team wants to extend his services to maybe develop him further. The prevailing notion on this thread is that this specific scenario is the worst case because you will be developing a QB with a much higher 2nd year cap hit when compared to a draft pick on a rookie contract (for a similar uncertainty). I don't think that is an accurate assessment (but it is certainly up for debate).\n\nIf Jimmy has this kind of year I see him getting an RG3-Cleveland type contract in the VERY best case. A front loaded 2 year \"prove it\" kind of deal. He certainly wouldn't command top dollar or even be considered an average QB in the league. He would be 4 years into his NFL career having proven nothing. Here are the terms of that RG3 contract (rounded approximates).\n\nRG3\n\nYear   Base   Signing   Roster   CapHit   DeadMoney      \n                                                     \n2016  3.25m 1.75m    234k     5.2m     6.75m\n\n2017  6.00m 1.75m    984k     8.7m     1.75m\n\nIf we look at the contracts for last year’s QB draft picks, we see that with the exception of Paxton Lynch, Jimmy G’s projected 2nd year cap hit of 5.2mil is the lowest. Not to mention that RG3 had one great year which means that Jimmy G’s numbers may well be lower. What is interesting to notice is that cutting Jimmy after 2 years, assuming the RG3 contract structure, will result in several million in cap savings, making this a team-friendly contract. Waiving the other 3 QB’s after 2 years is not feasible because of the high dead money charges. This suggests to me that even in a case where Jimmy G is average, his team is in a financially advantageous position in trying to develop him further than if they picked a QB in the first round of the 2017 draft and he were to fail to develop after 2-3 years. \n\n3.)Jimmy has a terrible year and is a bust. He is cut after one year. This is also seen to be a situation where a team has wasted a draft pick. That angle is absolutely true however, with one point worth noting. If we assume that the 1st round pick QB goes onto be a bust he cannot be waived after 1-2 years as the next year’s cap situation will be a disaster; especially for the top 6 picks due to the same salary cap dead money discussion we had above. A team will be forced to sit on a guy they may already know is not worth developing. This is a waste of cap space and prevents the team from moving on. With Jimmy, there is a clean break with no lingering dead money cap charges. Toward the lower end of the first round, where dead money charges are not too much of a concern after 2-3 years, the argument becomes: Do you rate any of the incoming late round QB prospects above Jimmy G? That is certainly up for debate but here is my perspective.\n\nJimmy G was projected to be taken in a late 1st to late 2nd round window in 2014. His work ethic, character and IQ have been validated by being a continuous part of a Bill Belichick team. In the 94 regular season snaps he took in 2016 he looked nothing short of terrific, albeit in a very small sample size. He has (hopefully) learned and developed his understanding of the QB position from Belichick, McDaniels, and Brady for 3 years. He has faced a Belichick defense in practice every day for 3 years in training camp and as part of the scout team. To me, these aspects put him well and above any college QB prospect in the 2017 draft.\n\nIn the cases I have described, it seems that it is plausible that the teams in the market for a QB will be financially better off by trading for Jimmy G rather than drafting a QB high in the 1st round. With all financial aspects aside, it comes down to how each team is grading QB prospects and if they feel confident in their abilities to develop a QB talent. There is always uncertainty and a risk of busts but I believe that this trade makes football and financial sense for the reasons I have presented.\n","score":"1","subreddit":"nfl"}

{"body":"Your entire approach to this is wrong.  \n\nFirst off, a relationship when you're 26 is one where you exchange your time, attention and money for sex.  A long distance relationship is one where you exchange your time, attention and money for ... not a goddamn thing.  \n\nWhy the fuck are you in this relationship?\n\nThat's the first problem.  You should just focus on your career and take all the time you would have spent talking to your friend-without-benefits and go to the gym instead.  \n\nThat's the big-picture problem.  The little picture problem: buying a car isn't a 5 minute prep task.  You're going to be spending hundred or thousands of hours worth of your labor for this material possession.  You should probably invest a couple of hours into the process.  So when she says she's 5 minutes away from the dealership, and what questions should she ask, you should tell her to turn around and go home.  This isn't a 5 minute-try-to-remember-what-I-just-told-you conversation.  It's a conversation about ideas and theories and incentives and emotions.  \n\nBut really, you shouldn't be training her on how to buy a car.  You should either do it yourself or let her do it.  Who is paying for the car?  If it's you, you should buy it, unless you consider a car to be a gift and you don't care about the money involved.  (I'd like to point out that for the price of a reasonable car ($36,500) you could have a different $100 hooker come to your apartment and blow you every single day for a year.  Or you could have your girlfriend not have sex with you and live 600km away). \n\nYou didn't lose your girlfriend because you didn't have a girlfriend.  You had a leech who wanted you to treat her like a spoiled princess.\n\nGo to the gym.  Lift.  Work on your career.

The group bisexuals is several percentage points defined as (8.1%).\n - Still has 94% of the subreddit Dutch nationality, but now we also know that 9% have a second EU nationals and 4.1% non-EU nationals.\n - The distribution among the provinces has remained virtually unchanged. There are many people who live in Gelderland, Noord-Holland and Noord-Brabant. Still, most choose their flair in their hometown of.\n - Still speaks 9 in 10 Dutch. This also applies to English. German seems to be a lot more difficult because only a third can hold a conversation and only half understands it. French is even more difficult, as it turns out. But there are however quite different responses in the other languages.\n\n \n\n - Many more people than last year describe their political views as \"green.\" We can not escape the impression that this also has to do with the current leader of the Greens. Progressives and liberals are also strongly represented. There are not really noticeable shifts, except that the new option for non-voters or blank is checked by 7%.\n - 6 in 10 people describe themselves as atheist and 2 in 10 as 'agnostic', just like last year. Again Christians are the largest religious minority with 7.5%.\n - One third of all subscribers working in the ICT and a third in science. Which representation was already clear, but gets really through. Furthermore, 10.7% chose the option 'finance / legal expertise \"and 10.1% for' art / entertainment, which is quite similar to previous years.\n - The level of education continues over the years, also about the same, but with a growing number of highly educated people.\n\n \n\n - Most people are satisfied with the Constitution. So too with the monarchy, already wants a third party that it is purely ceremonial. 15.7% for abolition.\n - The EU can meet with the approval of most people, but in quite different degrees.\n - 9 out of 10 will find tasty croquettes. Fortunately, we were afraid that we had to eliminate en masse.\n\n \n\n - / R / thenetherlands is especially strong growth this year compared with previous years. What is not surprising, because we see a doubling of subscribers every year until now. Also mods, incidentally. ;)\n - Most subscribers come again to see the name of the subreddit on Reddit or recommended. Some also because of the automatic suggestion (subscriber only counts as such after subscriben or unsubscribe from subreddits so throwaway accounts and the like are not counted).\n - The Discord server IRC channel caught up in a short time in terms of popularity.\n\n \n\nOn behalf of all moderators of / r / thenetherlands I want to thank all our subscribers.

You could make the cult leader the \"obvious\" bad guy, but really he turns out to be a good guy - and the big bad is the least obvious (like the cult leader's \"innocent\" librarian secretary).\n\nPerhaps the company who manufactures mana harvesting tech is a good company, trying to ultimately stop mana nova from ever happening, by keeping mana levels at a controllable level (through harvesting \"pockets\" of mana spikes, or \"manasprings\" - like \"hot springs\"). They could be helping the cult because they don't actually know about the cult - they think they are supplying the town where the cult is (they are not geographically close) and the cult has forged some contracts and paperwork etc.\n\nThis company could be bad, however, or owned by someone who just wants to make a ton of money.  I guess you'd have to figure out how the cult has a lot of money then.\n\nMake the mana somehow tied to the ancients - like, the mana is being produced by them in their dreamlike state.  Perhaps it actually protects them, also.\n\nOk - thoughts/observations.  As a GM, you might need to challenge yourself to look for ways to involve your players in the story.

I bought a 125 reef ready all glass tank in 1999, the only difference in the tank today is the overflows are only on the back wall, mine are in the corners.  \n\nI had a turboflotor skimmer as the \"Berlin method\" was all the rage.. that hasn't changed much, just no one knows what you mean when you say \"Berlin method tank\".  ATS, Berlin, and Jaubert were the main competing concepts and Berlin kinda won and no one knows WTF a jaubert is these days (it had a plenum and relied on anerobic action to consume nitrates)\n\nDeep sand beds were in vogue, I had a 6\" bed.  worked great till the tank lost power during a hurricane, and I believe the death of the sand bed caused a chain reaction killing the whole tank except my maroon clown.   I've run bare bottom since then (2005) so that trend comes and goes, its a personal preference now.\n\nI ran a mixture of halides and t12 VHO actinics on icecap ballasts when they were still made by a dude in his garage...  my first reef was actually a 20 gallon and had PC lights, so even in the 1990s you had lots of choices, just no LEDs.\n\nso equipment wise, its been small incremental improvements, but still basically the same.  a filter sock was unheard of.  most water movement happened from the sump, there were no propeller pumps like we have today to move water.  \n\nas far as livestock, you would be surprised, it was very similar choices.  the differences were : no ORA, so nothing was aquacultured.  I have an 18 year old maroon that was wild caught, shes the bomb :)  coral choices were similar, tho things like goniopora and alveopora were impossible to keep long term, and mandarins were something you bought for a few months, because they couldn't be kept alive for long in a tank.  interesting to me how that has changed... otherwise, it was kinda like the wild west, i would go to the store and buy a softball sized acro head that was brown as brown could be for 30 bucks ,and just wait for it to color up in my tank to know WTF it would turn out to be... some were duds, some were glorious.  so it was crap shoot, but it cost almost nothing to do it.   one coral i dont seem to see anymore was hydnophora, probably just not as popular these days, but I haven't seen one in years..  \n\none other big change is the name branded corals.  This one really bugs me.  it drove the prices thru the roof.  I can recall having like 50 or more ricordia in my 20 gallon, and thinking about how much they are worth now...I bought a rock with 5 on it for like 20 bucks... that would cost you 100 today..  \n\noh, live rock was king. you could order just about anything.  I have fiji rock, florida rock (pre-ban) bahamas rock, marshall islands rock, tonga rock.. all this stuff you cant seem to get these days as the collection sites get shut down, back then it was a rock and no one cared, walt smith imported what must have been millions of pounds of the stuff, now everyone does this sterile looking dry rock and that one bugs me,  its not natural... it works, and dont get me wrong, to each his own and you cant get your choice of rock today like you used to, but I just prefer some of this older stuff I have.\n\nso really, its kinda like the PC game, you cant use ISA cards today, but the concept of a bus still exists (You just use pci cards) IDE drives wont hook up to a SATA controller, but they are still hard drives, so the concepts and general ideas are similar, just tweaks on the orignals...

Go on, I'll wait because either Al Gore isn't an authority on the environment or he is. If he is, then he either wasn't tapped by the Obama administration because he really isn't, or the case for government regulation of the environment is moot; you *could* speculate \"he just didn't want to,\" but then again how valid is his passion for the environment? Did he not want to because he thought he could do more work privately? Again, a once-leader of the Democrat Party believes more in himself in the private sector than in a government controlled by the party he *just* helped lead not 10 years prior; not a great argument for the EPA *or* liberalism.

Without modern technology and its advances, we eliminate the big unknowns of global nuclear warfare, strong AI/cybernetics/technological singularity, uncontrolled bioweapons, and other \"ifs\" which would effectively render us extinct, either by killing us all, or by altering the human species to the point of being unrecognizable.\n\nIf we go back to some point on the spectrum of hunter-gatherer to early modern preindustrial civilization, though (and that is a very broad spectrum), it seems like our chances of sticking around would be pretty good.\n\nOf course, there are people who think that climate change or changes in the atmosphere will produce near-term human extinction. I've yet to find any credible evidence coming from these fronts.

These are freak numbers for such a big guy.\n\n- He can play a lot of different positions; while some people might see that as a bad thing, I think it's a great thing, because every single season there are injuries, and it's not crazy to think that one of our DBs or LBs will get injured for the season. Just plop Peppers into your position of need, and you have a starter-quality player in there. Not many teams can say they have the luxury to do that.\n\n- However, some people might be concerned that it's not wise wasting a #4 overall pick for a guy who will play just some games, and have a reduced impact. Well here's the big selling point: **the Jaguars run the Nickel package A LOT. Jabrill Peppers automatically fits into that Nickel spot**, over Aaron Colvin, which will make him see the field in at least 70/80 % of the defensive snaps. That's absolutely not a waste, and it will have a HUGE impact on the gameplay, since he'll be on field enough to have an impact, and yet still be very fresh from not playing in every single down, which can have a gigantic impact in games decided in the 4th quarter (the Jags had 10 1-point games in 2016).\n\n- He can play in special teams: Peppers can be a great kick/punt returner, and that's the type of player that can dramatically change the course of a game; instead of having Rashad Greene fumbling the ball inside our redzone, and concede points to the opponent, we could have Peppers running it out to midfield.\n\n- Finally, because there isn't a clear alternative. You might say \"oh but Fournette\", but the truth is, the Jags don't necessarily need Fournette, and with such a deep RB class, I can't force myself to believe we'll take one at #4. So we go BPA, which some people will say it's Thomas (who will go #2, so no go) or maybe OJ Howard (talented TE class, there's no way OJ goes top 5).\n\nI rest my case.\n\nEdit: I see people don't agree with me. Hmm. Come the 26th and you'll see...","score":"3","subreddit":"Jaguars"}

{"body":"With Doctor Blythe active? Jesus. Even if he didn't transform, Gon's emotions would have spiked his power to absurd levels against Pitou, putting him above even the attack that could've killed Morel. With full charge, and without Pitou being able to use any Ren-based techniques for defense, she'd be screwed. I would expect the result to be on the level of Phinks blowing that one ant to pieces with Ripper Cyclotron.\n\n\u0026gt; if Killua paralyzed Pitou and Gon had time to charge his Jajanken to its full power\n\nThis would never happen, though. Terpsichora seems to work similarly to Shalnark's Autopilot in that it's a manipulator ability used on yourself. Both Puppeteer and Terpsichora create Nen constructs that actually exert a physical force on the target's limbs - in Pitou's case, this is presumably synchronized with her own muscles to enhance her speed and strength. If Wing's percentage chart was correct, then as a specialist Pitou would have about 80% affinity for manipulation and 40% for enhancement, so Terpsichora could be significantly more effective than just using Ryu/Ken. Note that Terpsichora cannot exert a *net* force (or Pitou wouldn't have needed to exploit Dr. Blythe's restriction to cancel her momentum against Netero), and it seems to boost her power much less than Autopilot - but Autopilot damages Shalnark's body by overloading his muscles, and giving up control to a relatively simple computer algorithm is a pretty serious restriction.\n\nWhere am I going with this? I believe because Terpsichora is under Pitou's direct mental control she could use it to bypass her own nervous system similar to Killua's Godspeed. This would make her pretty much immune to electrical paralysis, or at least mobile enough that Gon wouldn't have time to charge Jajanken.\n\nObviously that's assuming they encountered her without Doctor Blythe active. But if it was active, I don't think paralysis would even be necessary; Gon or Killua could do serious damage without needing Jajanken.","score":"1","subreddit":"HunterXHunter"}

By about 2/3 of the way through the game you have access to pretty much all weapons and armor and getting any purple mod you want is pretty trivial.  Not only that but the modifications help but aren't super vital. You can beat nearly every enemy with a couple weapons and mods. I thoroughly enjoy running around and fighting machines, but not enough to play the entire game again. Now that I beat it I'll due up the game and run around fighting for 10 or 20 minutes until I'm bored, but that's about it.","score":"1","subreddit":"horizon"}

{"body":"This plan is pretty hilarious in that its so obvious just the reaction of people who hated Obamacare. There's nothing coherent in here - it's not a coherent plan. It's just people looking at Obamacare and saying \"hm, what do we hate about this and then how can we change just those things\"?\n\nMy favorite part of this, that I've read so far, is their solution for the individual mandate. Apparently, this plan removes the individual mandate, but they says that if you don't have insurance for more than 2 months, then an insurance company is *required* to impose a 30% increase in your premiums.\n\nThink about that. Think how crazy this is on so many levels. Just to make a couple points:\n\n**First**, it doesn't even solve the issue. The mandate had 2 basic reasons to exist - (i) it was a way of forcing healthier people into the markets, making the markets healthier as a whole and bring down the average premium and (ii) it solved the moral hazard problem, where people would just wait until they got sick before buying insurance (because insurance companies aren't allowed to deny you for a pre-existing condition).\n\nThis mechanism solves neither of those things. It does the opposite. All this does it let you buy into insurance when you get sick *at a slightly higher price* than the ACA does. This is...not a big incentive. If I get cancer, and I know that the costs will be $500,000 or something, who cares if my insurance premiums are now $600 per month instead of $400? That's not a meaningful difference compared to the liability. So people will still wait to buy in, ruining the purpose of the law.\n\n**Secondly**, this is even more unconstitutional than the individual mandate. In what universe of conservative political philosophy can the government force a private company to charge a certain class of people a higher price? That's insane. The individual mandate skated by as a tax because the penalty was paid *to the government*. What is the possible legal argument that this is constitutional while the individual mandate isn't?\n\nAnd this is just one part of this idiocy. Dear god. It's just so transparently obvious that this party doesn't care at all about this issue and has not thought deeply about it *at all* other than as political cudgel.","score":"7","subreddit":"politics"}

{"body":"Funny story.. You could almost say I got less used to my bees as the year went on.  When we first got our bees last spring, they were incredibly docile for 2-2.5 months.  I would crouch down RIGHT beside the hives in shorts and flip flops and the bees would completely ignore me. It was so cool and fun to be able to be close to them and just watch what they were up to.  We would set up lawn chairs in their flight path and watch them go by.\n\nOnce we started getting stung, we changed our tune.  First warning sign was when I got stung out of the blue about 15ft from the hives in late June.   Then they became ornery during inspections to the point where not wearing a suit would have certainly been unsafe.  We decided it was mostly our fault as we weren't smoking consistently and we were inspecting too frequently and taking too long.\n\nWe learned a lot in our first year, how to be better beekeepers.. but also I learned a lot of respect for the bees and their ability to defend their hive when they feel threatened.  Getting stung in the hand, foot or face is guaranteed to swell me up like a baloon (I am not exaggerating, imagine a latex glove you blew into like a balloon, that was my hand).  I always demonstrate respect for my hives, part of that is not inspecting without wearing all of my protective gear; gloves and a veil at the very least.  \n\nEven after learning respect for the bees, I still feel very comfortable overall when I am around them.  You will know the difference between a bee that is just checking you out or one that is trying to sting you.  Most of them land on you by accident when it happens.  We name each be that lands on us, \"Cornelia\" : )","score":"1","subreddit":"Beekeeping"}

I suppose the onus is properly on me to investigate their reliability and validity.\n\n\u0026gt;If you disagree, you need to present an argument or evidence. Simply asserting things is pointless.\n\nHere's my argument: there's a difference between gender identity and gender, right? Gender encompasses more than gender identity. Gender identity is a component of gender, but it's not the sole determinant of gender. You gave an example of a female with a beard and big muscles who identifies as a woman. That's a trivial example, but how about other ones: how about a little girl who dresses and appears a little girl but identifies as a man?\n\nIdentity is a *functional* thing. It's not merely appearance and it's not merely identity. It's socially negotiated. If the group says that you're a woman then you functionally are, because language depends on shared meaning and words don't have intrinsic meaning, but mean whatever people agree they mean.\n\n\u0026gt;You really struggle with context, don't you? Everybody who is accusing you of transphobia is in agreement despite having a broad background and there being a range of definitions.\n\nOh, my apologies, I thought by everybody you meant everybody that's been interacting with me, not merely everyone that's been accusing me of transphobia (like, two or three people).

Vegan cuisine is a good way of making nice salads to accompany the meat.\n\n\u0026gt; Do you have to know a bunch of science to eat well? (thinking of omega-3 intake, vitamin B12, etc.)\n\nYes, especially if you are physically active. Maybe you don't need to know everything yourself if someone happens to fix a diet for you but I imagine you would want to do that yourself. The same is true of carnism, though. Avoid all the stuff that turns you into a woman like basing your diet on soy, something I see vegans do all the time...\n\n\u0026gt; How complicated is it to not burden friends and family with the consequences of your diet choices?

{"body":"People who voted to remain in the European Union have defied conventional wisdom and gone on more of a spending spree since the referendum than those who elected to leave.\n\nThe counterintuitive behaviour was revealed in a survey which found that overall British consumers were still spending robustly and showed little sign of stopping in the short term.\n\nStrong consumer confidence since the referendum has been the key factor in maintaining vigorous economic growth, an outcome that has wrongfooted many economists.\n\nParadoxically, Remainers have increased their spending by more than Leavers, despite having much more pessimistic views about the impact of Brexit on the economy and job security.\n\nThe net balance of Remainers reporting that they had increased their spending was 19 per cent, well ahead of the 8 per cent scored by Leavers, according to research commissioned by the US bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nMelanie Baker, an economist at the bank, said that the discrepancy was intriguing but that the decision by Remainers to step up their spending was likely to be short-lived.\n\nRemainers expect prices to rise more sharply in the coming months, which might suggest that they have brought spending plans forward, rather than just increased their expenditure. They also expect to have to tighten their belts eventually.\n\nHowever, the research found little evidence that consumers overall were in any immediate hurry to cut back on spending, with most believing that Brexit would not affect them personally or that they did not know enough to make any spending changes yet.\n\nOnly 7 per cent of the 1,000 respondents said that the referendum result had already led them to cut back spending, while 20 per cent said that it had led them to increase spending either by a little or a lot. Sixty-one per cent reported no change.\n\nTraditionally, political and economic uncertainty encourages people to save more and defer expensive purchases such as cars, holidays, white goods and furniture, but there has been little evidence of this since June.\n\nThe study also found that the result of the referendum would be overturned if it were run again. Remainers today at 44 per cent narrowly outnumbered Leavers at 42 per cent. The change was because those who did not vote last time claim they would do so in a rerun and would vote to stay in the EU.\n\nForty-two per cent of those asked said that there should be a second referendum to ratify or reject the Brexit arrangements once negotiated, against 58 per cent saying that there should not.\n\nAsked about the economy in the next 12 months, 20 per cent of Leavers said that they expected it to get a little or a lot worse, compared with 80 per cent of Remainers. Asked about their own personal financial situation, 15 per cent of Leavers said that it would worsen, against 44 per cent of Remainers.","score":"5","subreddit":"ukpolitics"}

These appear ranked on merit of ability opposed to draft stock.\n\nIs this a case of applying different methodology for post-season issues with a deliberate decision to negate historical problems?

Or maybe you have big plans to make moves in the April addition to reflect the historical? \n\n(It occurs to me that using 'bias' in the final paragraph may imply criticism.

{"body":"1) The real quote is *I would argue the statement that I started being translated to* ***English*** *because of the game*. It makes no sense to debate quotes you invent yourself. \n\nAnd what Sapkowski said is accurate. The English translation of *The Last Wish* and the first game in the series were both released in English speaking markets in 2007. The translations had to be commissioned before the game appeared in English speaking markets and before it turned out to be success. (Which, if you recall, was modest at best for the first installment.) \n\n2) That statement is true. If Sapkowski wasn't popular, there wouldn't be an attempt (a second one, by the way) to make games based on them (and comics, and a TV/movie adaptation). \n\n\u0026gt; how many people read any of the Witcher books outside of Poland before The Witcher 1\n\nGiven the Witcher was a sensation in Czech Republic and Russia (and probably also other Eastern European countries, but I don't want to assume), I would say a lot. Russia is a very big market for literature. Sapkowski was therefore an already established author of international fame and significant cultural impact before the games. The games certainly helped him to break through on the very lucrative, but crowded English speaking markets, but English speaking markets are just a cherry on top in Sapkowski's career as a writer. \n\n\u0026gt; So does that make a little more sense?\n\nNo. It looks like you want to paint Sapkowski as an ingrate, who owes everything to the games that came long after he became a cultural icon in several countries, facts be damned. Why does Sapkowski bring out this kind of attitude in fans of the world he created, I cannot guess. ","score":"13","subreddit":"witcher"}

{"body":"I haven't heard anything about that, but basic googling tells me that soybean farming increases rates of erosion, runoff from pesticides and herbicides, and they're often grown as a monoculture.\n\nHowever livestock requires food and time to grow, which can be up to a few years before they are eaten. The plants they eat are often grown on tilled farmland (which increases erosion) and are grown as a monoculture and have runoff from pesticides and herbicides. The amount of plants it takes to feed the livestock is a lot greater than the amount of calories it would take to feed a human.\n\nThe amount of land needed to feed livestock is much greater than the amount needed to feed humans, so I highly doubt that soybeans cause more erosion than livestock farming. \n\nIf I recall correctly from one of my classes, the carbon footprint created by growing plants from far away and transporting them is less than the carbon footprint of a locally raised and butchered cow. So, if environmentally they're talking about emissions, I'd doubt it. \n\nSome more googling tells me the majority of soy goes towards feeding livestock rather than making tofu or soy milk or whatever way you eat soy. The large expanses of land used to grow soy are due to people wanting meat.\n\nTl:dr; they're wrong.","score":"9","subreddit":"environment"}

{"body":"This budget has to be one of the worst budgets I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. The spending is out of control, the taxes are out of control, and the surplus is literally killing the economy. \n\nFirstly, the sales tax is completely out of control. An 8% sales tax is the highest sales tax in the country. It's going to have a hugely negative effect on the incomes of the poorest people and is one of the most irresponsible taxes I've ever seen. The claim that the sales tax will make $250 billion in revenue is also completely ludicrous as well. No state sales tax has ever or will ever make $250 billion; that's absolutely nonsensical. \n\nI did the math on how much the sales tax (even if it was raised to 8%) would cost by extrapolating from Florida law to the entire state. Optimistically, it would raise $74,159,611,461.00. That's a $175b difference, meaning you've both ***raised taxes*** and ***have a huge deficit.***\n\nNext, your corporate income tax. /u/Autarch_Severian will go on and on about why corporate income taxes really aren't very good, but a 5.5% corporate tax is especially high and especially dangerous. Once again, this estimates far, far too much revenue. The Southern State has a corporate income tax of 2.3% and earns nearly $1b yearly. You've pretty much tripled the tax rates, yet you claim that it makes nearly **two hundred times more?** That's bizarre and your calculations must surely be incorrect.\n\n\u0026gt;The state shall levy a $0.36 tax on every gallon of fuel sold. The revenue from this tax shall be $650,694,587.\n\nThis is also highly regressive and just kind of odd - why would you raise fuel costs even higher than they already are?\n\n\u0026gt;The appropriation for the Department of Health shall be $85,000,000,000.000.\n\nThis spending seems a bit high - not catastrophic, but like $10b - $15b more than it should be (and that's after you include the presidential healthcare investment).\n\n\u0026gt;The appropriation for the Department of Education shall be $121,000,000,000.000.\n\nThat's also like $40b way too much money.\n\n\u0026gt;The appropriation for the Department of Energy shall be $12,000,000,000.000.\n\nThe Department of Energy does not exist in Dixie.\n\n\u0026gt;The appropriation for General Services shall be $4,874,654,981.\nServices will include Sewage, Water Treatment, and etc.\n\nThis is all local responsibility.\n\n\u0026gt;The appropriation for the Department of Social Welfare shall be $65,412,587,981.\n\nThe Department of Social Welfare doesn't exist either.\n\nA few other things.

I later find out that she's already cheating on her boyfriend with him, while telling him all about my \"creepy\" crush.\n\nStory #2 \n\nHad a group of friends in my first year of uni. There was one alpha girl in the group and I never really went for confrontation, so I happily let her have all the attention. Even so, if I bought drinks to share, she'd take the whole thing when I wasn't looking and refill it partway with water as if to hide it. If a guy in the group started talking to me, she'd sit on his lap to distract him. If I left my phone on the table, she'd grab it and throw it out the window, then lock me out of the building when I went to get it. \n\nStory #3\n\nHad male friend in uni who I went 50/50 with on a ps3 and small tv. He drops out of uni while it's at his flat and takes it back to Poland with him, along with a bunch of my games and other stuff we split 50/50. I send a bunch of FB messages and can see that he read them, but never replies. \n\nStory #4\n\nHave been doing mid-level work for 5 months now. Have to wait till July for my official promotion and pay rise. There are a few of us who are being made to wait for pay review, which is at a set point in the year.

I'm at university for the next year and the half, and even after that my intended career is such that deep work will be very beneficial to me. \n\nThat involves keeping my phone use to a minimum. So far I've got that going good - during the day, it's only an occasional check for messages or a very brief look at instagram.\n\nWhere I'm trying still to improve is in my morning habits and in my laptop use in the evenings. I know that I need a good hour away from the internet in the morning if I'm going to have a happy and productive day - picking up my phone or procrastinating on the internet in bed almost always leads to a wasted day. Additionally, the mindless browsing I used to do on my phone is often being done on my laptop instead in the evenings, and that needs to change. I'm already on my laptop for most of the day as a University student, so I need to find other things to do after my usual 9-5 day of classes and self-study. Reading, watching shows (political or otherwise informative where possible) and exercise are all things I'm trying to replace that with. \n\nIn short, my phone use has improved dramatically.

{"body":"Thanks for your honesty.\n\nI'm really hoping that DoA keeps going forward at a decent pace and with continued improving stability. I enjoy parts of it, but there's still things missing. Overall though the experience is very good and the UI is nicely done. \n\nFrankly my biggest issues with it at the moment are some of the pacing and tuning, but mostly the combat. I enjoy RTS, so real-time combat suits me nicely. But this feels almost less effective than SoaSE combat-wise but even less movement. \n\nFrankly though, the last two patches have made some quite noticeable changes and I feel good about my investment. I enjoyed my spree through it yesterday, and after this most recent beta patch my list of issues is smaller. Hopefully it keeps that trend! :)\n\nThe other one I've been loosely following is Lords of Rigel, that I truly hope comes to fruition and maybe even release this year...or EA release rather. \n\nLastly, I home Project: Space Sector succeeds where the rest have failed.

{"body":"The reason why these people are so hungry is because they aren't eating _good_ food. If you're eating healthy - whole grains, chicken, meat, vegetables - it's difficult to over eat. There's a whole fitness culture that offers \"bulking advice\" because eating a ton of calories to put on weight from healthy sources is really, really hard. You can't stop eating when you're eating processed, calorie-dense foods because your body is malnourished despite the number of raw calories you're eating.\n\nHad you argued that some fat people are exhausted after a 70 hour work week, or that some fat people can't afford healthy food - then I could sympathize. But to say it's because they _crave_ too much food - well, I'd crave too much food if I ate shit all day.\n\nThe reason that shaming doesn't work isn't because it doesn't motivate fat people to lose weight. ***It's because fat people literally don't know how to lose weight.*** Hint: It has nothing to do with running on the elliptical for hours a day while watching netflix and everything to do with learning about how to navigate the _entire_ gym and cook for yourself.\n\n\nI'm not minimizing the social problems fat people have. But it comes down to a lack of effort in taking the time to educate yourself. That's it. It's hard, it's a grind, but it's not complicated, and it certainly isn't lucky. And this is where all the \"fat-hate\" comes from - it's the fact that you can say people are \"lucky\", when really they take the time to go shopping for healthy food and to prepare it. Shopping, cooking, doing dishes and actually learning how to do all this shit is a part time job. It's obscene how much time I spend in the kitchen, and I'm a full time engineering student who works on the side.\n\n\nI don't fat shame because I don't give a shit about you or your decisions. But there is absolutely no reason why 99.9% of fat people couldn't be fit if they took the time to educate themselves. Did you know that a mocha latte from starbucks has more than 500 calories and 32 grams of sugar? The _only_ luck that comes into play is whether you are around health conscious people so you learn good habits. But even that only works up to a certain point.\n\nI didn't know how to cook or lift weights till I got to college. I got tired of being a chubby loser so I bought books on nutrition and weightlifting, and spent hours reading, watching youtube videos, and experimenting in the kitchen. Obesity runs in my family, both my parents are morbidly obese and my grandfather was dead at 46 from a heart attack.

Person in back just happens to be a wanted felon. \n\nFelon who we will call Jim from now on, panics. He runs into an adjacent corn field evading a cop. \n\nThe cop makes contact with gym trying to get him on the ground. Jim goes for the cop's gun (bright guy). Face to face with Jim, the cop draws and fires two shots. One grazed along the side of his head. Jim reads to one side and gets shot in the ass with the second round. \n\nFast forward, Jim is at court. The defense was attempting to argue that Jim was shot from behind. This is because the bullet wound left a mark on his head. This mark started out small and then got bigger.\n\nDefense, said that the bullet disintegrated as it got farther along his head, thus he was shot in the back so to speak. (This isn't true, because bullets get larger as they break apart.) \n\n**Now this is where stuff gets real.** Jim pulls down his pants and effectively moons the jury to show where he got shot. Now, he didn't just show his leg, his entire ass and probably his man-hood were all on display for everyone to see. \n\nHe did this twice, both on separate occasions. \n\nTL;DR Felon evades police officer and gets shot in the butt.

Whether that's worth doing mostly depends on the time you have available, your desired performance, etc.\n\nThe reason you wouldn't use something like this by default is, as mentioned previously, that relatively simple evolutionary algorithms typically already produce very good results. Whether any particular extension then provides a net benefit to performance would directly depend on the problem you're applying the algorithm to.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that such an extension can easily result in worse performance as well - either because of the chosen parameters (e.g. for how long you'd skip on already visited nodes) or its concept itself, e.g. if the amount of iterations saved by getting good results more quickly is outweighed by the increased processing time per iteration or if the extension limits traversal of the solution space too strictly and thus omits valid (and potentially optimal) solutions.","score":"1","subreddit":"pathofexile"}

I am in the process of reading the novels ( volume 3-7 arrive at my door sometime this week) and I have watched the anime. The novels are by far better than the anime, so if you have seen the anime don't let it ruin your opinion on the novels.\n\nLike r/Aruseus493 said, its a naive and innocent boy who wanted to get girls by becoming cool and powerful (hence the name) but finds out he is a weak shrimp. He then falls in love with the strongest warrior known because she saved him when he was about to die. The story then progresses with his determination and journey to reach her level so that she sees him as an equal. As he goes on this journey, he meets a lot of people and makes some unconventional yet very helpful allies with his bright, caring, and a bit selfless personality. This causes some other people to have crushes on him but he is to naive to notice, causing comedy to ensue.\n\nIf you just sit back, relax, and not really think to much into the details then it is a very fun read with a bunch of laughs. Some of the humor is obvious while others are a bit more underline. Either way it caused me to laugh despite knowing what would happen since I watched the anime.\n\nThe only issue that I had with the story so far is that the big plot twist in the second volume is painfully obvious, but still played out well none the less.","score":"3","subreddit":"LightNovels"}

The key similarity is that it's the focus of the battle and once it's destroyed the battle ends because it controls the whole army. It may not be a literal superweapon (as in a planet killer or something bigger), but sure as hell plays the part.\n\n\u0026gt;Well, I wouldn't say the Naboo resistance was under-equipped, they were just caught by surprise after already being blockaded.\n\nThey definitely were! It was a tiny force of just a few on the ground, plus an army of Gungans using heavily outdated tools.\n\n\u0026gt;its aliens were all new except for returning characters\n\nNew aliens are a good thing...and there were definitely plenty. Now, for the rest of your points, Takodana is a very different planet than we've seen, and the entire atmosphere of Starkiller is quite different than anything we've seen as well. Its snowy forests, for example, set a very unique scene.\n\nOne of the key things about TFA that makes it good though is that its *new* stuff was all the best parts. The new characters, new pace, new cinematography and directing style, new events...ask anyone who likes it and they'll say their favorite part was one of the new characters or new events (such as the graveyard dogfight, or the interrogation scene, or the bridge scene, or the final lightsaber duel, or the finale). Ask almost anyone who liked Rogue One what their favorite part was, and almost everyone will say the fan service scene (including myself).\n\nThe Republic is also for sure going to play a part in VIII--they can't just blow up the capitol and just leave that a loose end untied.\n\n\u0026gt;The major problem with that is that it is a bad thing when your plot frame is too familiar like it is in TFA.\n\nSure, it's an inhibitor. And that's why it'll never be my favorite over Empire. The point where it became a flaw for me was with the existence of Starkiller. But the rest of the film was so well executed that it's still a fantastic film.\n\n\u0026gt;Debatable.\n\nSure, but you'll find that the vast consensus says that TPM was poorly executed, and that TFA, even if derivative, was well executed. If I had time to write out a bigger essay, I can be super hyper analytical about all the brilliant things TFA does, and all the ridiculously stupid things TPM does.\n\n\u0026gt;I don't think it did.\n\nBut I just went into detail on that...you could respond to whole paragraph instead of reading a sentence at a time before moving on to my explanation.\n\nMy issue with all of these is that not only were a lot of these backstories not-well-executed (even if they made them more interesting), but they seem to say that all of these characters has to wind back to each other, even 20 years in the past. Which just gets silly, because it's an entire damn galaxy. That's the issue with 3PO being built by Vader, or the Death Star designed by the Geonosians.\n\n\u0026gt;but the prequels opened up the universe far more than the OT did.\n\nWe somehow simultaneously saw more planets and yet everything was connected by the same dozens of people.\n\nNow, The Clone Wars TV show did a far better job of opening the universe up, because there, not everyone had to be connected to the OT characters, and countless new ones were introduced as well.\n\n\u0026gt;He wasn't. He was a wookiee who happened to be involved in the situation and who helped Yoda escape.\n\nNo, he was. He is seen by Yoda's side through the entirety of his time in command on Kashyyyk. He and Tarrful were both right under his command.\n\n\u0026gt;He pushed 3PO in ROTJ too, off of the barge.\n\nBecause the ship was about to blow up and R2 knew this because it was part of the plan, and 3PO didn't know that.\n\n\u0026gt;To set them up for the end of RotS. They didn't seem all that wooden to me.\n\nYou've gotta rewatch the movie--I'm talking about their first appearance in AOTC, by the way. Not only do they not connect to the end of ROTS through that sequence, but their acting is literally just reciting lines in the most monotone voice without any sign of expression. This hit me in particular when Owen says, \"I guess that makes me your stepbrother\" and absolutely nothing happens of it, or friendly greeting or anything. It's hilariously shoehorned in.\n\n\u0026gt;None of the things you listed \"don't make sense\".

From what I can gather, only the one officer was actually struck, so let's just call it one count for now.  That's a Felony of the First degree (F1).\n\nWe have likely two counts of Felonious Assault; one per each officer.  Technically, they could try to go after him for one count per shot, but those would likely be merged as \"allied offenses.\"  Normally, this would be a felony of the second degree (F2), BUUUUUT, since the victims are police officers, Mr. McRae gets upgraded to two more F1's.\n\nHaving Weapons while under Disability (AKA: having a firearm after being convicted of a felony, or while under indictment), Felony of the third degree (F3).\n\nAssuming the Attempted Murder would be merged with one of the Felonious Assaults as an Allied Offense (one action; two charges.  You cannot be punished twice for the same action for Double Jeopardy reasons), you're still looking at 3-11 years per F1 and 9-36 months for the F3.\n\nAND THEN, you have specifications that he used a firearm in the commission of the offenses attached to every single charge.  That's an extra 3 years per (but due to merging issues, I think he can only serve one, maybe two; it's been awhile since I looked into this).  So, let's just add three mandatory years to that to be generous.\n\nSo that's possibly 25 years and 36 months max with these charges alone, assuming they don't charge anything else.","score":"8","subreddit":"ProtectAndServe"}

{"body":"Is anyone else here old enough to remember a few years ago when Democrats wanted to raise the debt ceiling, and the Republicans were like \"**NO.**\" and threatened to shut down the government over the issue? Back then the Dems played the media like a fiddle and made it sound like the sky was going to fall and it was all because evil Republicans didn't get their way. Now the tables have turned, but they feel like they are on the right side of history so they get a free pass to do whatever it takes to get their way. And it will still be the Republicans fault.","score":"4","subreddit":"The_Donald"}
