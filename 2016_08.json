{"body":"I'll explain since there's still 15 more weight classes between men and women to come. \n\n\nWeightlifting is made up of two lifts: the snatch and the clean and jerk. \n\n\nThe snatch is a very fast movement where the lifter must elevate the barbell into an elbow-locked, overhead position, in one fluid movement. \n\n\nThe clean and jerk has the lifter elevate the bar overhead with a segmented stop at the shoulders. During the first phase--the clean--the bar must travel to the shoulders and when the lifter catches the weight, remain in the same position until he stands up. If it slips during the squat, it's a no-lift. If the elbows touch the knees (which happened once to the Japanese lifter iirc), it's a no-lift. The lifter must come to a complete stop between the clean and the jerk, but the bar can keep oscillating. The lifter can rerack the weight as he pleases (as some lifters like a wider grip for the jerk), but the lifter only gets one attempt at the jerk, meaning they can only dip and drive the bar up once. One lifter in the -48kg class messed this up and was red-lighted. I think it was the Kazahkistani girl. The elbows must lock out during the jerk and remain locked out. \n\n\nThe lifter must bring their feet in line to receive the down signal, while remaining on the platform. \n\n\nSome other rules: the bar must remain on the platform, even after the lifter has dropped it. Most any equipment (belts, knee wraps, etc.) is allowed, with some exceptions (no powerlifting suits, no supports on the elbows). \n\n\nEach lifter gets three attempts in the snatch, and three in the clean and jerk. If a lifter misses all three snatches in the Olympics, they are not allowed to clean and jerk. This isn't true for world championships, however. \n\n\nLifters have one minute from the time the bar is loaded to start the lift. The lift is officially started when the barbell passes the knees, so you can pick it up and restart if needed, as long as it stays below the knees. If a lifter has to follow themselves, they get two minutes. The exception to this is when a lifter misses a lift, and another lifter is scheduled for the same weight. If the second lifter is called, but then changes their attempt, and it reverts to the first lifter, the first lifter only gets one minute instead since another lifter was called. This occurred a couple times during the -48kg competition. \n\n\nLifters need two white lights to receive a good lift. There are three judges at the center, and on each side of the platform, as well as a jury that can overturn judges decision. This is good since the judges were fucking awful today. \n\n\nIn the case of a tie, the lighter body weight wins, but that rule won't be in affect starting in 2017. There's a long list of tiebreakers instead of that. \n\n\nI think that's the gist of it. Let me know if you have any other questions. I personally think Men's -77kg and -85kg classes will be the most fun to watch, lots of competitors that could challenge world records. Unfortunately with the drug retests and Russian debacle (entire team banned), many of the best lifters are absent, so some of the better classes are less so this time around. Still, the two mentioned above will be great. \n\n\nIf you care in particular about Americans, Morghan King placed 6th today. We have two more ladies competing: Jenny Arthur competes in the -75kg A session, Sarah Robles in the +75kg A session, and one gentleman, Kendrick Farris, in the -94kg B session. \n\n\nI dunno where you were discussing this in the main thread, but feel free to post my answer there and tag me if people have other questions. \n\n","score":"15","subreddit":"olympics"}

I said to the taxi driver to don't leave with the vehicle, that they (the passengers) had commited a criminal act. They had destroyed the gas station property and I told them to wait because I asked for a police car, got it? The taxi driver said: all right. Turned off the car and said he would wait for the police car.\n\n\u0026gt; I heard some noise on the back of the gas station, where the bathroom is located, I heard the noise of a bottle falling on the floor, when I got to the place, the manager was coming with a destroyed \"advertisement board\" in hands and said: help me here because they're causing trouble, they're breaking everything. When I got close to the bathroom, these four foreigners ran to the inside of the taxi. When they got to the taxi, I went to the driver and said: don't leave because they broke some stuff on the bathroom. I'm calling the police now. I called the 190, asked for the police and kept waiting. But they didn't want to stay inside the taxi at all, they wanted the taxi to leave. I said they wouldn't leave, that I was waiting for the police car to arrive. They started to say \"fuck, fuck, fuck\" and got out of the car to evade the place. Two of them ran to the street. Two stayed because I stopped them, because I said they wouldn't leave. When the two the went to street saw their friends with me, they came back in my direction. When they came back in my direction, if they would attack me, or not, because they were very very very drunk. My friend who was with me at the gas station saw the two coming in my direction, pulled out the gun, told them to stop, the was when I pulled my gun as well. I identified myself, I said to everyone go to the ground. Later, a person able to speak English came, he told them to lay down, that I was a policeman, that I was there to help, and they told that they broke the bathroom, they urinated on the ground, and they told they had 20 dollars and 100 reais to pay for the damages to the gas station. I called the manager and said \"they have 20 dollars and 100 reais, they want to go away, don't want trouble\". They gave this money to the guy who speaks English, I called the manager, and he gave the money to the manager saying \"Give this money to the gas station owner to pay for the damage, they will leave, the police car didn't come.\"\n\nFemale voice of the journalist: \n\u0026gt; The security guard said the none of the athletes were inspected.\n\nBack to the security guard:\n\u0026gt; I didn't even see their wallets. I didn't see a wallet at all. I just saw the moment he gave 20 dollars to the guy and two 50 reais noites.\n\nBelow in the link, there's a \"Depoimentos de (testimonies from) Bentz e Conger\". Translation:\n\u0026gt; In his testimony, Gunnar Bentz said that he, Feigen and Conger were afraid that Lochte caused even more trouble in the gas station.\n\n\u0026gt; As shown in the \"Statement Term\" signed by Bentz, which G1.com had access, the swimmer reported that, as they stopped at the gas station to urinate, Lochte broke the advertisement board that was preached in the wall, what made a lot of noise. Bentz said to the police that, after the incident, he and the other swimmers decided to leave the gas station, fearing the Lochte broke other stuff.\n\n\u0026gt; Bentz stated that they were prevented from leaving the place by armed men who didn't speak English and showed some kind of badge. He also said that asked to Ryan Lochte calm down after he argued with these men.\n\n\u0026gt; Still according to Bentz, the approach of the other man who spoke in English enabled the situation to be clarified. The swimmer said that he handed over, without being asked to, US$ 20 he had in his pocket. Feigen would have given at least a R$50 note.\n\n\u0026gt; Conger also said in his testimony that was Lochte who broke the advertisement board in the gas station. He also said that he became aware only by the press that his colleague lied in interview reporting the false robbery.\n\nSorry for poor vocabulary and other mistakes in the translations.","score":"235","subreddit":"olympics"}

Wenn es nicht schon kompliziert genug ist.\nEs kann wirtschaftlich auch positive Effekte haben, wenn viele Menschen kommen. Und das kann dazu führen, dass Du mehr verdienst. Aber das ist schwer zu messen und unmöglich zu beweisen.\n\nWer im Sportverein ist, der hat schon ganz konkrete Nachteile erlebt. Wer sonst? Und wie? Vielleicht die Staatsbediensteten, die Überstunden bei der Registrierung der Flüchtlinge machen mussten? Wer noch? \n\n\u0026gt; Und beim Thema Asyl ist auch klar, dass durch die Art und Weise, wie Deutschland den Zustrom erlaubt hat, nur Leute gekommen sind, die nicht mehr in Gefahr waren. Sieben sichere Durchreiseländer und so.\n\nAha? Wie sicher fühlst Du Dich denn gerade in der Türkei? Nur, weil jemand bei seiner Flucht nicht sofort aufhört zu flüchten, wenn nicht mehr geschossen wird hört deshalb nicht auf Flüchtling zu sein.\n\nDie sich ständig wiederholenden, m.E. schon erledigten und dummen (sorry) Argumente, die ich immer und immer wieder auf Reddit und anderswo lese erschrecken mich etwas. Denn das Thema Flüchtlinge hat sich noch längst nicht erledigt. Es warten noch hunderttausende in Lybien auf einen Seelenverkäufer.\n\nAußerdem verläuft diese Flüchtlingsbewegung in Wellen. Wann und wie die nächste kommt ist nicht abzusehen. Ich rechne mit einer Verzehnfachung durch Klimaflüchtlinge in den kommenden Jahrzehnten. Also eine Größenordnung rauf. Mindestens. \n\nUnd die, die hier die ollen Kamellen von bösen oder guten Flüchtlingen, australischen Lösungen, Grenzen zu, \"Zustrom\" (tolles Wort übrigens, damit verwandeln sich Menschen mal eben in einen \"Strom\", eine unkontrollierbare Masse) sind bei weitem nicht alleine. Deutschland kann \"nur\" eine Million Flüchtlinge im Jahr aufnehmen. Oder nicht? Keine Ahnung. Aber Polen kann nicht mal ein paar hundert? Die anderen Osteuropäer gar nicht? Frankreich nicht mal ein paar tausend? Das hat ja alles politische Gründe. Und wenn kein Land aufnimmt, was geschieht dann mit den Menschen auf den Booten im Mittelmeer? Werden die alle in Griechenland und Italien bleiben? Oder versenken wir die Boote schon im Mittelmeer, bzw. retten die einfach nicht mehr?\n\nWir müssen da mal ehrlich diskutieren. Aber dann eben wirklich ehrlich. Und dann muss auch die Fremdenfeindlichkeit auf den Tisch, die scheinbar jede rationale Diskussion in Europa unmöglich mach. Wo genau hackt es denn? \n\nUnd warum kann der Libanon bei vier Mio Einwohnern eine Mio Flüchtlinge aufnehmen, aber die EU bekommt bei 500 Mio Einwohnern und einer Mio Flüchtlingen Schnappatmung? Diese eine Million fallen dabei zahlenmäßig gar nicht so sehr auf, wenn man die \"normale\" Migration betrachtet. \n\nUnd wie sehen konkret die Einschränkungen aus, wenn 2020 10 Mio Flüchtlinge vor der Tür stehen und sich Europa anschickt sie wieder nach Deutschland durchzuwinken? Mich beschleicht da das Gefühl, dass die Turnhallen dann nicht mehr ausreichen. ","score":"0","subreddit":"de"}

Kinder sollten zu mündigen Erwachsenen erzogen werden, die selber entscheiden können, an was sie glauben wollen, deswegen wäre ich dafür, dass jenseits eines wie auch immer gearteten, **wissenschaftlichen** Religionsunterrichts Schule generell eine religionsfreie Zone ist.

If you check out our webpage at Cedars-Sinai you can see a graphic path on what we think is going on in most IBS patients [http://ow.ly/1wgq302SZMS](http://ow.ly/1wgq302SZMS). We know that food poisoning causes a portion of IBS. We now believe that food poisoning creates antibodies in us that work against your gut and its ability to move food through the gut. These antibodies are called anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin. The test for these is now commercially available in the US for anyone to get. If these antibodies are the cause of IBS, getting rid of them might cure the disease. We have hard targets. What is amazing, is that through generous gifts and partnerships with companies, we have gone from IBS being a disease due to stress to now saying IBS is an autoimmune disease in about 60% of cases. This is huge! Yes, I can now say that new and better treatments for IBS could be discovered with an infusion of money because we know where to go now.\nWith that amount of money, I think we could now reach a cure!

{"body":"Niels here: thank you, this is a very important question. I would like to stress that we are not implying that either the virus or the plants have been evolving with intent. The host plants would enhance their fitness by producing more offspring, whether infected or not. CMV would enhance its fitness if it can infect more host plants.\n\nOne way the virus might achieve this is by manipulating its host plants to become more attractive to aphids that transmit the virus to other plants. This process has been described by Kerry Mauck in 2010, when she worked at Penssylvania State University in the laboratory of Consuelo De Moraes and Mark Mescher.\n\nAnother way is by increasing the reproduction of susceptible hosts through the enhanced attraction of pollinators, which is what we described in our paper. In this case both CMV and the susceptible plants benefit: the virus because there will be more susceptible plants to infect and the susceptible plants because they produce more offspring. This positive effect of CMV on plant reproduction, whether the direct product of “selfish” virus and plant evolution and/or maybe a “by-product” of selection on a different process such as the attraction of aphids, can be visually described as a “pay-back” from the virus to its susceptible host plants because both benefit from this interaction. The word “pay-back” is only a visual description of the outcome of the plant-virus-bee interaction we see in our experiments. It does not refer to the evolutionary selection pressures that led to this outcome, which are of course free from intent.","score":"1","subreddit":"science"}
{"body":"That seems unlikely to me. Only a very small number of bacteria would actually encounter such a device, so the overall reproductive advantage from being able to survive it would be small. This is compounded by the fact that it's the lesser size of the bacteria which makes them vulnerable to this material. Changing to grow larger is a much bigger shift than, say, a point mutation on a receptor. So it's less likely and more resource-intensive, and being larger would also affect other aspects of the bacterium's life in ways that might not be adaptive.","score":"1","subreddit":"science"}

Study on algebraic varieties basically dried up in the early 90s and so there's a whole chunk of theory that was developed in the C^N case that was never generalised. We exploited properties of the projection and higher dimensional branch cuts to recover a bunch of that missing theory. For instance, we were able to compute the mass of log-psh function (i.e. \\int (ddc u)^M ) to be d(2pi)^M where d is the number of branches of your variety.

An average game of soccer or hockey or basketball (other common street games in other countries) requires a lot more running, concentration and teamwork.\n\nThe kind of sports you play as a young kid defines your future health and personality and cricket just stands as a really bad choice to me.

{"body":"Well, I had to relive that rollercoaster of an ending again. \n\nI might be in a minority when it comes to this, but I think that the movies were very solid adaptations of the game. The movies managed to find that pretty good balance between relying on the source material, cutting what wasn't necessary, and then adding some stuff to flesh out various elements. \n\nFor example, the first half of this movie was focused mostly on showing the effects of [Nyx's arrival](http://i.imgur.com/Y1jvhXG.jpg) and how it [affected the main party](http://i.imgur.com/sTxKUBu.jpg). It really made it look like the end was approaching and the humanity started to slowly perish, one by one. It was conveyed in the game to a certain degree, but simply seeing the empty streets and half filled auditorium in their school was so much more powerful.\n\nThe decision to include \"dates\" with Elizabeth in this particular time period was also great. While the relationship between Yuki and Elizabeth was very rushed, it was very appropriate that Elizabeth with her [crazy antics](http://i.imgur.com/pDriz58.jpg) and immeasurable energy was the one who managed to pull Yuki from his depression. \n\nThe development of every main character and their eventual decision to not give up, while [very cheesy](http://i.imgur.com/2N6lHFl.jpg), felt [immensely satisfying](http://i.imgur.com/EtlX1O8.jpg).\n\nThe final battle. Holy hell. I'm a bit sad that the final battle was 1 on 1 of Yuki versus Nyx Avatar, but it was awesome nonetheless. Seeing Thanatos go wild on Nyx Avatar and then [Yuki delivering the final blow](http://i.imgur.com/I4oKq3v.jpg) was just awesome! Also, mad props to the subber, who pulled [Nyx's quotes straight out of the game](http://i.imgur.com/FjFaPtz.jpg). Oh yeah, [MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE FOR EVERYONE'S SOUL!](http://i.imgur.com/WDdtSGJ.png) FUCK YEAH! \n\nAnd the finale. Goddamnit. The game was a bit more subtle about it. In the game characters would say stuff like \"You seem a bit tired\" to Yuki, but in the movie you [could see that](http://i.imgur.com/HB8lstE.jpg). He's at his end. He managed to survive until that day only thanks to his promise to his friends. And in the end he [slowly falls asleep on Aigis' lap](http://i.imgur.com/pGnvFnO.jpg). Oh, yeah, in case you haven't figured it out (because I haven't when I've finished the game for the first time), Yuki died. [He sacrificed his soul to stop Nyx](http://i.imgur.com/ZXkw2NK.png). I hope they'll make The Answer OVA to show how his death affected the rest of the team.\n\nSo yeah. That was the final Persona 3 movie. I'm quite satisfied. They were pretty solid adaptations. Sure, they cut a lot of stuff, but I think the movies made a good decision with focusing on Yuki's character and how he slowly grows closer to his friends. The additional development for other main characters, including Ryoji, was also very welcome. \n\n* [Holy fuck, Aigis looks terrifying](http://i.imgur.com/I1ia2Ak.jpg)\n\n* [This is why I love Junpei](http://i.imgur.com/dTNeQiJ.jpg). He's an ass, but he always admits his mistakes and learns from them.\n\n* [This whole sequence was so eerie](http://i.imgur.com/UTKI97r.jpg), with the distorted version of Memories of The School playing in the background \n\n* I don't know if it's because of Persona 4 Arena: Ultimax, but the movie [decided to focus more on the relationship between Koromaru and Ken](http://i.imgur.com/zIqLwcd.jpg)\n\n* [Nice after credits scene](http://i.imgur.com/kqnr0SL.jpg). Looks like it's Elizabeth embarking on her journey to liberate Yuki's soul.\n\n\n\n","score":"14","subreddit":"anime"}

{"body":"Seconding Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei. Here's some more highly acclaimed shows which are thematic:\n\n\n**FLCL** [[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/227/FLCL)] FLCL tells the story of (among other things) Naota, a kid whose life gets turned around when a crazy woman whacks him on the head with a guitar. If that sounds wacky, it's because FLCL is a very wacky show. But it knows exactly what it's doing, and pulls off one of the best coming-of-age stories I've ever seen. It's also only 2.5 hours in total runtime, so it's not a huge commitment to get into. The soundtrack, by The Pillows, is also amazing and perfectly accompanies the show. This is a strange comparison to some, but FLCL reminds me of Evangelion in that it's heavy in symbolism and requires some thought to really enjoy. In the same way that Evangelion attempts to tell the story of humanity, FLCL tells the story of one kid. But it does it just as well, IMO.\n\n\n**Cowboy Bebop** [[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop)], **Samurai Champloo** [[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/205/Samurai_Champloo)], and **Sakamichi no Apollon** [[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon)] These are the three major shows by Watanabe Shinichiro, and all three are music-focused. Cowboy Bebop is the jazzy story of space cowboys and the people they meet. Samurai Champloo is about hip-hop samurai in the Edo era. Sakamichi no Apollon is about WWII-era high schoolers who play jazz. Needless to say, one of the major reasons people love these shows is the soundtracks. All three shows have truly amazing music. But they wouldn't be really great shows without a good stories, and Watanabe delivers on that front as well. I highly recommend watching at least one, and if you enjoy it, continuing with the others. My personal recommendation is to start with Cowboy Bebop, but they're totally unrelated stories so you can ignore that advice if you want.\n\n\n**Ping Pong** [[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation)] This show is basically a dozen character stories rolled up into one amazing narrative. You follow the lives of high-school ping-pong players and watch as they deal with the struggles of growing up (you may have noticed I have a personal bias towards bildungsroman). I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that the way this show has some of the best character development I've ever seen. I held off watching this for a while because I thought it would be another generic sports anime, which it absolutely is not. Highly recommended.\n\n\n**Shinsekai Yori** [[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori)] In the modern day, humans gain telekinesis. 1000 years later, we follow the story of Saki, a girl in a \"utopic\" village, who tries to uncover the secrets of her society. And much, much more. You really feel like you're unraveling the mystery with the characters (kind of like Steins;Gate). While the characters fall short of great, the worldbuilding in this show is really remarkable.

{"body":"/u/Manhento\n\n[Perfect Blue](http://myanimelist.net/anime/437/Perfect_Blue)\n\nThis was really intense.  I can definitely see why it’s a classic, since it really felt like the kind of thing you’d watch in a film studies class or something.  This is the first Satoshi Kon movie I’ve seen, and I’d say he lives up to his reputation.  The animation seemed pretty dynamic, especially [Perfect Blue](/s \"during some of the more violent scenes like the screwdriver stabbing\"), and the use of transitions added a lot to the tone and plot of the movie.  I was also a big fan of every scene that featured a mirror or reflection.  In other words, the movie did a great job of the technical aspects.\n\nMy main complaints are really only that [Perfect Blue](/s \"I thought the villain looked a bit *too* evil.  Like, he definitely has a scary face and that’s one approach to horror, but I think things might have been more suspenseful if the movie didn’t tell you which characters were evil just by their character design.  That’s largely a personal preference, though, and the way they drew Me-Mania was still scary enough that I can’t deny the effect.  I also had a hard time with some of the more graphic scenes.  I think I watched the director’s cut, and the “rape” scene and screwdriver stabbing seemed very long and drawn out.  They did their job perfectly, so it’s not really the movie’s fault, but it was still a lot for me to handle, personally.\")\n\nOn a more positive note, I liked some of the themes that the movie explores.  [Perfect Blue](/s \"For example, it taps into some old anxieties about the internet which may seem a bit quaint today, but give us a quick look into how people thought of it back then.  A more relevant theme was that of surveillance.  There’s a huge visual and narrative focus on cameras which I found really interesting, and of course there’s the stalking aspect.  Me-Mania’s frequent filming and photographing of Mima are clearly stalking, but the story also compares those actions to the entertainment industry and asks how different they really are.  It’s the mix of surveillance and exploitation that drives Mima over the edge, which means that it was not only Me-Mania, but the culture of entertainment that ruined her.\")\n\nOverall, I’d say that this was a very good movie, but it didn’t always correspond to pure enjoyment, which I think was also part of the movie's message.","score":"2","subreddit":"anime"}

Both shows have a lot to tell, and do it in a very funky and metaphorical way.  \n\n\nFrom weirdest to less weird: YuriKuma \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Penguindrum = Utena. I find Penguindrum to be easier to watch (it's also eyecandy, and unlike Utena it isn't episodic-ish during a lot of its run), Utena easier to understand its point and YuriKuma... well, it's an acquired taste, it's extremely self-indulgent and while it's not devoid of substance it feels like surfing through the director's stream of consciousness.","score":"2","subreddit":"anime"}

The helpless and clumsy girl, the shy girl, the introverted guy, the hot-blooded MC and the stranger that comes to change everything. The supporting characters make their appearance but aren't properly introduced, you'll get to know them and love/hate them later on.\n \nMaybe you first time watchers are starting to guess the love triangle and where this is going, you might even think \"oh, this is another school comedy-drama with some sci-fi twist\". That was kind of my first thoughts back then, but boy was I wrong.\n \n**The set**\n \nSo we get to see beautiful backgrounds, all the scenery is eye candy. All those little details like the fish passing in front of the TV, the blue fire under water, everything is just beautiful.\n \nWe also have a great lore: people used to live in the sea, but some decided to explore the surface. The *Ena*, you might think is some plot convenience to explain how their clothes dry so fast or how they can talk under water, but it got so much more behind. I would love to see a prequel to explain further about all the myth behind the Sea God.\n \n**First time watchers**\n \nI really want to know your opinion about this show. It's one of my personal favorites. The art, the dynamic between the characters, how complex the story develops through the episodes and of course the finale, great closure for a great show.

I don't consider that a flaw.\n\n\u0026gt;Also, it does a poor job at conveying how much time has passed. Characters don't mention that weeks/months have passed, and they didn't change much physically in 8ish-years time.\n\nI can't think of an instance when they didn't eventually mention it.  But even apart from that, there are plenty of visual cues, mostly to do with the seasons passing/uniforms changing/weather changing.\n\n\u0026gt;Side characters are not given development\n\nI'd consider such a thing a bonus.  I mean, they're side characters for a reason.  Even so, we definitely do see development for most everyone here.  Regarding your specific examples, Sunohara goes from deservedly being the punching bag of the universe to being a fairly stand-up guy, and Kotomi goes from recluse weirdo to fairly socially competent.  That they didn't go beyond that cannot be the fault of anything but a limited run time.  If the show went on for a third two-cour season, there might be time for something like second character arcs, but there are other side characters and a main story to get to here.\n\n\u0026gt;Kyou\n\nYou cannot tell me you don't know anyone like this in real life (sans comedic exaggeration) that you don't still consider perfectly normal.  Has strong opinions, doesn't mind pushing them, airily ignores own faults, is for the most part in the right about judgement calls, reluctant to admit to tenderness, uses all previous items to help out loved ones.  That's far from what I'd call \"terrible\" or \"poorly written\".  In fact, I'd say Kyou is quite similar to everyone's beloved Akio, most of the difference being that he does everything with a grin instead of a scowl.","score":"7","subreddit":"anime"}

{"body":"Like most situations, the answer depends. The most important thing is to understand the implications of both approaches as they each have their advantages and disadvantages. With raising money, you're usually putting yourself up against a wall with a hard deadline to either grow or raise more money. Frequently, you'll hear stories of companies spending as much time fund-raising as they do actually working on their product.\n\nWith a few exceptions, raising money comes with expectations of very large returns from investors. Depending on the investors and valuation of the business, this could mean different things. For example, if you raise $100,000, and the investor expect to see $1,000,000 in returns in three years, you could be in a tough spot. Imagine the business reaches a sustainable $300,000 and gives you and your founders a healthy and happy lifestyle, but your investor wants to see their return. What happens to the business?\n\nAlternatively, with those kinds of expectations of growth, you may end up needing to take steps that you'd rather not. Whether this means focusing on growth over quality, or cutting costs for giving your customers great support in favor of spending time on marketing, you may end up less than happy with your decision.\n\nAll of that said, raising money can be like pouring lighter fluid on a fire, with all of the good and bad implications of that. It will burn hot and fast. That could mean accelerating growth, or it could mean burning through your reserves and ending up in a place where your business is in the red. That may mean that there's not enough left to pay the founders or the investors.\n\nThe alternative to this is bootstrapping like it sounds like you currently are. The lower you can keep your personal expenses, and the more you can \"raise\" money from your own jobs, the more sustainable the business will be. It's likely to grow more slowly, but you and your co-founders will retain more control. The other upside by bootstrapping initially is that once the business grows, you can still choose to raise money, but you'll have more leverage.\n\nEven with fundraising, if you can keep your fixed costs as low as possible, you're still in a great place. What you spend the money on will depend entirely on your business, but the more you spend that money on things that will generate more money and more growth the better. For example, if, instead of spending it on office space, you focus on marketing or other tactics for growing brand awareness, you'll be more applying that money in much more productive ways. You could also hire more, but additional salary costs are some of the most difficult costs to cut if you need to reign in spending.\n\nThis is a really high-level overview, but some folks have commented more extensively on this on their blogs. Off the top of my head, Josh Pigford addressed some of the [funding vs. bootstrapping arguments](https://baremetrics.com/blog/bootstrapped-to-funded).\n\nThe key to remember is that there isn't a right or wrong answer. It depends on your context, your goals, the type of business, and much more. It's become cheaper than ever to launch a software startup, and raising money isn't as necessary as it used to be, but in the right situations, it can certainly be useful. As long as you look at venture capital as a tool to be used and not a fun toy to play with, you'll be thinking about it right.","score":"2","subreddit":"startups"}

You're a photographer for hire, not a full time photographer for one particular coffee shop.\n\nIf you're really set on shooting exclusively for them, then I guess I'd certainly charge them a pretty steep premium, but only you know what that should be.

So...\n\n**First, consider if peace is *actually* what they want, or if it's something else related.**  For example, maybe one character really just wants to feel *safe*, maybe one character wants happiness for his country/economy/people, and to be viewed as a successful leader (because he stopped the war); etc.\n\n**Second, if they do actually all want peace and that's it, consider *why*.**  Consider this on a personal level - no obvious answers like \"because war is bad and hurts people\".  Why would *you* personally want peace?  Maybe it's because they're terrified of death; maybe it's because they're terrified of losing; maybe it's because they have a lover who's a soldier and they really just want that person to come home.\n\n**Third, once you know what everyone wants, consider *how they get it*.**  You've got a lot of personality traits up there and those can inform your decision here: maybe one person decides they're gonna crush their enemies in order to get peace - voilà, that's their goal, and a helpful part of their personality: when presented with conflict, they'll likely try to \"win\".  Maybe another character expects to achieve peace by manipulating different leaders - now you have a goal for *that* character, and a good part of their personality: when presented with conflict, they'll likely try to talk/sneak their way out of it.\n\nSomewhat related, I think you'd be surprised at the \"diversity of thoughts and opinions\" regardless of setting.

This would be a reasonable intermediate solution that would not interfere with hunting, collecting, or sport shooting (since it would still be legal to carry a weapon--of any type, even so-called \"assault weapons\" that have randomly become the boogeymen of the antigun lobby--to any destination you might want to use it.

The camp counselor becomes a sadistic expert in planned Stockholm syndrome towards NPC captives.\n\n**THE ANIMAL LOVER**. The tiny girl end up playing a cannibal fetishist. Ate humans, saved cats. Ran over humans with a truck to steal their dogs.\n\n**THE SECRET KINGPIN.** The local game store clerk turns into a massive tri-state drug manufacturer and buries his vampiric competition alive in meth infused CONCRETE.\n\n**The SEXUAL STEREOTYPE**. One who ONLY plays female characters (as a male) with every worst D\u0026amp;D stereotype...and when killed makes the SAME trope multiple times in a session! Chain mail bikinis, DD's, roll to seduce the innkeeper for a free beer etc type.\n\n**THE BIGGEST GUY IN THE ROOM** (over 6'5\") only played the biggest guy possible in D\u0026amp;D for years. He was loud in real life so he yelled at the table. He moved like a big guy in normal life so in game he acted like a WINDMILL OF LIMBS in fine china shops. It was always himself, turned up to 11 I suppose.\n\n**The RAPIST**. The ONE guy at the table who has some sort of insanely detailed plan involving chloroform, hacksaws, vampiric Potence and stair banisters..................because the NPC pick pocketed him in the market.\n\n**The DUH**....that one player who always looks at the DM/GM like a scared rabbit every time you ask an opinion or an action even after they have been in the group for years on end.\n The spotlight burns this kind of player, you have to handle their interactions differently in the game. Thisd kind of player is not to be confused with the DUH CELLPHONE type though, the quiet ones are usually paying attention and into it but in their head. It's up to US as DMs to bring it out.\n\n**The PARANOID** is the one who pokes ALL THE THINGS with the 10' foot pole. EVERY npc is out to cheat, lie or betray them. EVERY quest is a trap, every patron is secretly plotting their downfall and every lord is secretly hiding something. It must be up to this player to discover ALL THE BETRAYALS! Except....sometimes there is no trap. No plot, no evil BBEGt in the shadows.\nSometimes....the DM is just fucking with this player type because its fun.\n\n**The OVERPLANNER** because who doesn't have the player who, when told the group has a inn room, then proceeds to booby trap every movable object and door. Or, when given a group hideout, maps and details every inch of it with 100000x ways for invaders or robbers to meet horrible ends. This player loved the design and creation stage the most. Pouring all their efforts into elaborate plans can REALLY slow the game down at times....instead of a battering ram they decide to design a custom steam powered gnomish ram with hand drawn schematics and calculations and questions like Hey DM, whats the tensile strength of Dwarven forged Brass, I need to know for the dragon mounted KILLDOZER im building to attack the bandit camp outside town!\"\n\n**THE NICE ONE** because some players and characters are the same outside of just murder and debauchery. Some people shirk away from in game violence as they would in the real world. This is where the best clerics and druids (or worst Brujah) come from. They tend to help moderate the others murder cycles with some compassion (\"Aw comeon, kill the villagers but leave the orphanage alone!\")\n\n**THE MMO GURU** has a VERY hard time with the transition to open free form movement and gaming. Especially with me, I am a free form improv DM and find those with exclusive game backgrounds tend to adjust slower to going from a format where everything is presented AS IS in a visual static world to a tabletop RPG where their decisions are expected to impact the surroundings and drive plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n**THE DM**   Hey now, let's not leave ourselves out guys....maybe it's a player at your table who also DM/GMs or maybe its you. We know the rules, the system and usually the worlds better than most. Also if you need the most violent, gore drenched and insane member of any group it might just be your DM! Why? Because we hear and take in EVERYTHING you players do at the table. Our worlds take shape around you, the colorful players, and your antics and actions. We get to determine and describe the outcome of your sudden barbaric DE-FLESHING of that lone kobold...but we also get to describe your heroic actions and amazing rescues!

{"body":"Stars Without Number ([free](http://www.rpgnow.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition?term=stars+wit\u0026amp;test_epoch=0) or [deluxe \"Core\"](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/94621/Stars-Without-Number:-Core-Edition) edition) with the supplement called [Polychrome](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/91490/Polychrome-Cyberpunk-Adventure-for-Stars-Without-Number?manufacturers_id=3482) would be a great start.\n\nCompared to Shadowrun the rules are lighter, with a mechanical crunch level approximating old school D\u0026amp;D.\n\nShadowrun has something of a seemingly endless buffet of cyberware and gear, and SWN + Polychrome doesn't have that. An assault carbine is an assault carbine, a light laser pistol is a light laser pistol, a piece of cyberware that makes you stronger is mechanically indistinct from the others that make you stronger, etc. so there's less gear detail / gear fetishism.\n\nThere's no reason a GM couldn't translate a bunch of concepts from Shadowrun but the idea of there being average gear and better gear and awesome gear is probably going to run into trouble somewhere mechanically if applied to everything.\n\nHacking is *ultra-light* compared to Shadowrun. It basically covers four concepts: remotely accessing controls, data, money, or creating fake IDs.\n\nThe SWN setting, as written, is intentionally light and is intended to be ignored by a GM as needed. Polychrome itself is just one world out of thousands, so it sounds like you'd need to export the concepts from Polychrome (which is basically a cyperpunk world) to a broader setting.\n\nSWN includes a bunch of easy to use GM tools to help generate organizations and worlds. There are lots of other expansions, but tread carefully - they're all balanced pretty well, but it's information overload to try to dump them all in at once. Choose the ingredients necessary and what's nice is that you can add others later, as needed, without upsetting the game.\n\nFor example, if the characters continue to go on mercantile ventures, the Suns of Gold supplement adds detail to that aspect.\n\nThe difference between the free and core versions of the main book are that the core book includes two extra chapters: Mecha and AI. That's it.\n\nPsychic powers are included in the default setting but could be completely ignored leaving a 100% playable game.\n\nA flaw in the system that I see is that character customization is not very detailed in my opinion. It's class based. \n\nThe rules are derived from D\u0026amp;D, but aren't technically d20 even though there are so many similarities that this may be a pointless distinction.\n\nCharacters have skills and there are only 3 classes, warriors, experts, and psychics. Psychics have themed powers (unlike D\u0026amp;D's wizards.) Experts have the most ability to gain skills as they level up, and warriors fight the best.\n\nI suspect that when Kevin Crawford revises the game (sometime next year) that character customization and spaceship battles will be the two mechanical areas he polishes. Space battles are a little flat. The Skyward Steel supplement spices things up for bridge-style combat, but exciting dogfights will rely heavily on GM - player narrative flair instead of tactical choices in many cases. The game isn't geared with the assumption of space combat as a regular event.\n\nStars Without Number's other releases (and all of Kevin Crawford's other work) is very solid.\n\n**tl;dr:** Stars Without Number is a satisfying toolkit for a GM to build exactly what you describe. The character mechanics are on the simple side of standard mechanical games without many *interesting* choices compared to other games. Likewise, mechanical conflict systems (like space combat) tend to be straight-forward without a diverse array of tactical options (but I don't mean to imply that there are none.)\n\nSolid system, *strongly delivers on GM tools*, relies on GM-player cooperation to avoid \"I roll to attack / I do damage\" - style combat.","score":"1","subreddit":"rpg"}

{"body":"Those are citations of games that use dice.  That's not what you stated, you specifically said:\n\n\u0026gt; it is clearly in the rules of most RPGs that use dice that you **must** adhere to the results of the die roll.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\nI don't see that in any of the links you have here.  Show me the 'must'.  Yes, it is implicit, but it is in no way mandated here anywhere that I can see.\n\n\u0026gt;  if you can find a game where the results of a die roll are stated to be optional, I would love to see it.\n\nYou've never heard of Rule 0?  THAT explains A LOT.  Sorry, I just assumed you had.  Google's your friend here, but I did find an [excellent summary](http://forums.sjgames.com/showpost.php?s=6c8382587d6207f34699443b201e222b\u0026amp;p=1211094\u0026amp;postcount=523).  I'll quote some:\n\n\u0026gt; There are several techniques you can use to keep from killing off your “main characters.” Some of these are totally contradictory. As GM, you’re the boss. Use whichever methods you like. (GURPS B496)\n\n\u0026gt; Cheat! When all else fails, roll the dice where the players can’t see – and then lie about your roll. “It worked! You finally got the door open. You rush through and slam it behind you. The orcs cannot follow.” When an “honest” roll would result in a bloody massacre, it is forgivable for the GM to cheat in the players’ favor. (GURPS B497)\n\n\u0026gt; Isn’t this cheating? Well, yes, in a manner of speaking it is, but it’s “cheating” in order to make the game more interesting and fun for everyone involved. So long as you don’t alter the outcome of die rolls unfairly or maliciously and you do it to help ensure the game is fun, interesting, and challenging, you shouldn’t have a problem. Beside, the players don’t have to know you change the occasional die roll. That’s one of the reasons it’s a good idea for Gamemasters to roll their dice out of sight of the players and then announce the results. (Mutants and Masterminds p174)\n\n\u0026gt; Cheating and Fudging: We all know that cheating is bad. But sometimes, as a GM, you might find yourself in a situation where cheating might improve the game. We prefer to call this “fudging” rather than cheating, and while you should try to avoid it when you can, you are the law in your world, and you shouldn’t feel bound by the dice. A GM should be impartial and fair, and in theory, that’s what random dice results help support. Some players have trouble putting trust in their GM, but dice offer something that’s irrefutable and truly non-partisan (as long as the dice aren’t doctored or loaded, of course). Still, it’s no good if a single roll of the dice would result in a premature end to your campaign, or a character’s death when they did everything right.\n\u0026gt; Likewise, don’t feel bound to the predetermined plot of an encounter or the rules as written. Feel free to adjust the results or interpret things creatively—especially in cases where you as the GM made a poor assumption to begin with. For example, you might design an encounter against a band of werewolves, only to realize too late that none of the PCs have silver weapons and therefore can’t hurt them. In this case, it’s okay to cheat and say that these werewolves are hurt by normal weapons, or to have the town guard (armed with silver arrows) show up at the last minute to save the PCs. As long as you can keep such developments to a minimum, these on-the- spot adjustments can even enhance the game—so the town guard saved the PCs, but now that they have, it can give you leverage over the PCs to send them on their next quest as repayment to the guards! (Pathfinder Core Rules pg. 402)\n\n\u0026gt; Rolling behind the screen lets you fudge if you want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a character, you might want to change the second critical hit to a normal hit, or even a miss. Don’t do it too often, though, and don’t let on that you’re doing it, or the other players feel as though they don’t face any real risk—or worse, that you’re playing favorites.

There is a lot of development being done at the Garfield green line stop and I suspect that will soon become the mainstay for students traveling. \n\nNever open your wallet late at night for a stranger. This is city smarts anywhere, not just Chicago. Other tricks I've seen muggers try to use is asking you what time it is so you pull out your cell phone. Don't have your phone out either, even to check a text or the wait time for the bus. \n\n","score":"8","subreddit":"chicago"}

{"body":"Some points:\n\n1. So, not building additional residential housing is going to cut down on the number of people sharing a room how?\n\n2. The above article mentions 94 Orchard Street as an example -- your citation of undesirable overcrowding.  Information on that building can be found [here](http://streeteasy.com/building/94-orchard-street-manhattan) and [here](http://apartable.com/buildings/94-orchard-street-manhattan).  The building has 16 units which average 464 sq ft each for a total of 7888 sq ft.  The total number of people mentioned in the article is 80 (16 per floor assuming five floors of the actual building, built 1900, rather than 4 mentioned in the article), or 98 sq ft per person.  Yet in Portland micro apartments of [150 sq ft](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/01/realestate/manhattans-population-density-past-and-present.html?_r=0) are being proposed.  If we assume that there are 30 couples, that gets us to 150 sq ft per family unit, where a family unit consists of one or at most two people.  And you'd be against providing those people housing?\n\n3. Living conditions are not much different today in some parts of SF. Existing SRO often have dimensions that are not much over 100 sq ft having no bathroom or kitchen(-ette).  The conditions mentioned are not some unimaginable 3rd world horror.\n\n4. It's hard to come up with a scenario where it would be better for the thousands of homeless currently living on the streets to continue living there rather than in micro apartments or SROs, either from the perspective of their own health and safety or the health and safety of the city as a whole.\n\n**EDIT** correcting math error that under counted the total number of people in the building as 64 rather than 80.  Which brings the statistics in line with the article.\n\n**EDIT** Also correcting second link.","score":"1","subreddit":"sanfrancisco"}

{"body":"Hi OP, I recently graduated and am going to be attending grad school in a STEM field in the fall, so here's my input. My field is biology, so I don't know if this is all 100% applicable to EE, but hopefully I can answer some things for you!\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nMost grad schools like to see at least a year of solid research experience, especially at the doctoral level. But honestly, the more experience you have, the better. I think it's best to take your first semester to acclimate to college life, and start looking at professors whose projects interest you in your second semester. (It's rare that you'll find a prof who will even take on a first semester freshman, they want you to adjust, too!) Reach out to them to see if they have space available for to begin researching with them your sophomore year. They'll probably want to have a short interview with you, but they're usually very excited to have an undergrad interested in their research.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm not an engineer, so I'm not 100% sure on this, but in my field, it's also acceptable to work with professors whose projects have a lot of crossover to your field. In general, ANY research experience is better than none.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nUsually people start looking for internships during the summer after their sophomore and junior years. I'm not 100% sure about co-ops, however, because they're not really common in my field.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to pursue a doctorate, research is definitely the number one priority. Internships are important, but they're usually only for a few months, and grad schools like to see long-term involvement with a project. Again, I'm not too sure about co-ops! But since they're usually long term, I would think they look very good to admissions!\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nMinors are usually not given TOO much weight, but of course, they can only help your chances. Since I'm not in EE, I don't know which minor would help you out more. That's a great question for your advisor, though!\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nIt never hurts to attend career fairs to get practice speaking to potential employers. Don't feel the need to go to every single one, though!\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nGrad schools like to see leadership experience, so yes, it's more important to dedicate yourself to a couple clubs and work your way up to having some responsibility. I don't know about engineering clubs, though, sorry!\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nI think having your own project is a great idea, especially if you have a research topic that you personally enjoy. If you end up doing research with a prof, ask them if it's okay to use their lab and equipment. They'll be able to help you designing your project, as well.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nHope you enjoy your freshman year, OP!","score":"1","subreddit":"college"}

{"body":"\n\u0026gt;1.\tI’ve only traveled a little bit so I’m not very familiar with the flight buying experience.  When is the best time to buy? Where and when do I get the best deals?  How far in advanced should I buy?\n\nStart checking six months out but typically three months is when it gets good. Where are you flying from? There are just some dirt cheap flights to SA these days on Spirit, Jet Blue, etc. I just paid $150 for a one way from Virginia to Bogota. If you are flying out of Florida, Texas, or SoCal I think you can reasonably find your ticket for under $250 each.\n\n\n\u0026gt;2.\tWe will be flying into Lima and probably fly to Cusco shortly after.  How far in advanced should I buy the plane tickets to and from Cusco?  Can they be purchased the day I plan on flying or should I have them all purchased before I arrive in the country?\n\nBuy the flights at the same time. You definitely will pay less than showing up day of...that's crazy stressful and costly. FWIW I think Lima is a totally forgettable city compared to the rest of Peru. If I were somebody like you, traveling with time constraints, I'd recommend not even leaving the airport on your way to Cuzco.\n\n\n\u0026gt;3.\tBesides booking the Inca trail in advance I don’t plan on booking any of the other tours in advanced.  I’ve read a lot of people saying that buying tours/trips is much cheaper when you get to Peru than booking before online.  Is that true?  Will I have any issues booking tours/trips the day before or the day I want to do them?\n\nWhat other tours are you planning on booking? Inka Trail for July should definitely be booked as soon as possible (six months out? Earlier?) but you seem to already know that! Make sure when you are shopping for Inka Trail tours to not do the absolute cheapest, because you want a company that treats their porters fairly. Also FWIW I think the *real* Inka Trail is SO much cooler than the alternative routes (Salkantay is second best, \"jungle\" is worst).\n\n\n\u0026gt;4.\tWe’ve never stayed in a Hostel before and I think it would be a cool experience, plus they seem to be a bit cheaper than hotel rooms.  What are hostels in Peru like?  Would they be fine for two honeymooners? \n\nHaha! Awesome. I think hostels are the way to go for all travelers. So \"hostels\" is a BIG category. First of all, I'm assuming you'll want to rent a single room in a hostel and not do dorms, right? Because you're going to want some privacy since it's your honeymoon and all...it will also provide added security so you don't need to worry about your luggage. Next, you need to decide on what type of \"hostel\" you want. Cuzco is a great example for illustrating what I mean. Cuzco has two of the most famous party hostels in South America, Loki and Wild Rover. I met people at Loki who'd been there a week and basically hadn't left the hostel (which, to be clear, is insane). Of course, that doesn't have to be your experience there but it's...interesting to see. Then there are of course lots of more stereotypical backpacker hostels that will provide experiences varying from sterile to crunchy, but all fall within the normal sense of a hostel (in that they are actively trying to cultivate some sense of a hostel experience, some better than others). Then, because it's SA, you'll find TONS and TONS of more locally run places that don't offer the \"tourist amenities\" and may not have the international culture but offer super cheap single and double rooms. I got a single at one of these in Cuzco in 2012 for two weeks at 12 soles ($4) a night.\n\nSo this is a long way of saying you need to know what you like, and since you inherently don't know this (because you've never done one before!) but likely have a decent enough budget, I'd recommend just heading to trip advisor and hostelworld, seeing what the best ones are on there (also look at the cheapest ones to get a sense of how low you ~could~ go so you don't get fleeced at your eventual choice. I'd say you should be able to stay at a good hostel for the two of you in a private room for $30 without trying.\n\n\n\u0026gt;5.\tI’ve done quite a bit of research, but I want to hear from you!  What are your must see/must do’s in Peru?\n\nYou need to explain more what your interests and limitations! I have a three week itinerary for Peru/Bolivia that I like to hype to anyone who will listen. Since you only have 10-14 days I could give you the three parts and you could pick the two you like. It's kind of backpackery so you could definitely upgrade the experience with a little money but to me it's one of the best three weeks I've ever spent traveling!\n\nPart 1: Camino Inka\n\nDay 1: Fly directly to Cuzco from the US. Skip Lima entirely (one way tickets).\nDay 2 \u0026amp; 3: Sight see Cuzco and surrounding area. This is mainly to acclimate to the altitude.\nDay 4-7: hike Inka Trail.\n\nPart 2: Lake Titicaca\nDay 8: Travel to Puno. You can take a bus, a tourist bus, or a plane.\nDay 9-11: Go to the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca on the standard 3-day, 2-night tour. Stay at Amantani and Taquile. They have a wonderful Mediterranean feel.\nDay 12: Travel to Copacabana by bus (you'll need a visa in advance to go to Bolivia. It's easy to get but costs $160 or so).\nDay 13-15: Travel to the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca. Go to the Islas del Sol and Luna. They have a totally different feel, very mystical and isolated.\n\nPart 3: Salar de Uyuni\nDay 16: Travel to La Paz\nDay 17: Travel to Uyuni by train.\nDay 18-21: Do the standard Salar de Uyuni Tour\nDay 22: Travel back to La Paz, fly home.\n\nThat's obviously a pretty packed schedule. If you really like adventure and don't mind crappy bus rides, the Salar de Uyuni and accompanying national park is truly the most incredible series of natural wonders I've ever seen. If you want to chill out, just spend more time on Lake Titicaca (maybe only go to the Peruvian side).\n\nLet me known if you have any questions!","score":"2","subreddit":"travel"}

But she's not even a particularly good sentence writer, better perhaps than the general public but still dust-covered when in the company of writers.

{"body":"\u0026gt; Have you ever thought about it the other way around? What should authors do in this case? Stop writing cause they'll earn even less than they do already?\n\nThis would only happen if you eliminated copyright, which I am not advocating. If you'd carefully read anything I've said in this thread you'd see that I'm advocating shortening copyright, but I am still advocating for the author's life plus twenty more years. That is plenty of time for them, their spouse, and their children to profit from their works. In fact, I doubt if most authors even see any profit on their books after even a decade. But I'm still allowing their whole life plus twenty years. That can easily reach seventy years of copyright. \n\nAnd I don't think you can honestly tell me that the author's decision to write a book would change because he or she would no longer have copyright for author's life plus seventy years to author's life plus twenty. In some cases copyright can even extend go for 120 years. \n\n\u0026gt; Yet you didn't brought up a single one.\n\nYes I did. In fact, I've brought up quite a few of them. Amongst these are that copyright protections extend far past the author's ability to benefit from it, discourage adaptation, stifle other creative works, and increase costs of books. It's a balancing contest. I think the balance is wrong right now; you don't. But you can't argue that there aren't two reasonable sides to this. \n\n\u0026gt; I really don't see why copyright needs an adjustment. If you wanna read books for free, go ahead and do so:\n\nI think there are plenty of arguments in this thread alone for why copyright should be changed. And I can't see why you refuse to accept the legitimacy of any of them. Part of debating something is not just ignoring and dismissing what the other side says. I'm perfectly willing to engage with you, but you just wish away every argument. \n\nAnd it truly isn't primarily about the money for me. I do think there are major societal benefits to free or cheap books. Every dollar cheaper means more people can access the book and enrich their lives with it. There obviously needs to be a balance against this and that is copyright, but that doesn't mean copyright need extend as long as it does. \n\nProject Gutenberg is truly a great example of just what I'm taking about. There are thousands of books (many of them classics) that someone who may not be able to afford books can now read or access immediately. But it has massive holes in its catalogue, notably most of the twentieth and all of the twenty-first century. Now some of those would still be under copyright in my model too (including the twenty-first century ones), but a number of the twentieth century masterpieces would now be available in a cheaper and more accessible for my the public. \n\n\u0026gt; To clarify my point for you, let me put it this way: I've seen thousands of comments online and heard dozens of comments in real life that are fine with copyright the way it is now. Got it?\n\nI'm a little dubious about this because the Internet is so anti-copyright in my experience, but maybe you just manage to hang out in more pro-copyright circles than I do. Regardless, I think it is clear that many, many people think the system is illegitimate. And that is dangerous. I'd rather copyright reform and maintain its legitimacy than potentially be attacked writ large. \n\nAnd again, I point to the vast majority of American history when copyright was substantially shorter than it is now, potentially not even for the duration of the author's life. This didn't stop author's from writing and profiting. It didn't seem to stifle creative works. So why would my proposal do that?","score":"1","subreddit":"books"}

The parents of every era tend to be appalled by the sexual manners of their children (regardless of how hectic and disorderly their own sex lives once were, or still are). There were some in the 1950s who were pretty sure that the decadent new practice of “going steady” augured moral disaster. Both Sales and Orenstein have undoubtedly grim and arresting information to impart about the lives of American girls. And neither of them can be dismissed as a sexual puritan. (They are not troubled about teenagers leading active sex lives, they assure us, only about the severely limited forms in which female sexuality is currently allowed to express itself; they are not even against casual sex per se, just eager to ensure that there should be, as Orenstein puts it, “reciprocity, respect, and agency regardless of the context of a sexual encounter.”) **Even so, neither of their books entirely avoids the exaggerations, the simplifications, the whiff of manufactured crisis that we have come to associate with this genre.**\n\n\u0026gt;Both writers make rather invidious comparisons between the frenzied, romance-free social lives of today’s young women and their own halcyon youths. Sales recalls walking back from school with her ninth-grade boyfriend to do homework together at her house. “The point of being together was not to have sex, necessarily. It was to become intimate,” she writes. Orenstein observes that her college experience was not about binge-drinking and hook-ups, but “late-night talks with friends, exposure to alternative music and film, finding my passions, falling in love.”\n\n\u0026gt;To use these sun-dappled recollections of life before the iPhone as a way of pointing up the misery of girls’ present conditions is a little misleading. To be sure, certain kinds of sexism have been amplified—or perhaps transmitted more efficiently—in the Internet era, and girls are now under pressure to present themselves as pliable sexual creatures at a much earlier age than they have been in the past. But even in the far-off 1970s and 1980s, young women experienced their share of exploitation, abuse, and unsatisfactory sex. \n\nI love Zoe Heller's writing and am glad I got a look at this essay of hers, but neither of these books sound worth the time at all.

The job is to create a cake; it shouldn't matter what it's used for after creation. \n\nThe following barometer may be used: if the person giving the request is changed, would you still refuse the request?

When someone makes an overtly political gesture as showing a flag of the EU, that crosses a certain boundary of prudence. It's a different matter than for a Kosovanian to compete for her nation for the first time. Yes, there is a political element inherent in that situation. But the politics of it were settled outside this Olympiad, and are not an issue in the arena of competition. As regards Tibet, there was no independent nation of Tibet competing, and the Olympics in China successfully ignored the matter completely. And perhaps that is best, for to bring that into the Olympiad would have tainted the spirit of the games. I say that as someone who respects the nation and history of China, while desirous of the restoration of a sovereign Tibet.\n\nIf you decide that it is acceptable for athletes to make political gestures once they have achieved victory and have the attention of the world, then you must accept whatever their gesture, including ones that may not be palatable to the vast majority of people. For it is not the quality of the gesture that grants them permission to offer it, but the prowess of their athleticism which has allowed them to ascend the pedestal of victory. So if it were 1936, we must accept both the fists raised in assertion of righteous Black Power as well as the hail in salute of Nazi might. That is, we must accept it if you truly believe in the principle of such expression as inherently granted to the victor.","score":"1","subreddit":"europe"}

It's still on the horizon, true, and I overall would prefer it, but still, there are several counterpoints here:\n\n1. Good education without good quality of life leads to brain drain. You will educate your citizens just to see the brightest leaving for greener pastures, effectively nullifying your investment and giving it to other countries.\n3. Higher levels of education is a much more competitive market than weapons. You can't compete with Harvard or Oxford just by throwing cash to education. But if you already have a top-notch military complex, you can compete with top weapon manufacturers if you throw money at it.\n4. Our system of education is too different from European/American. While our schools are at least as good as European, making our higher education institutions competitive will need a complete overhaul of the whole system - at the very least, merging Research institutes with Education institutes, or we'll never appear in the international ratings. \n5. Improving education is not what we really require now to improve the country. We have a lot of brilliant scientists and good research done - we just can't use it properly, and turn new discovery into innovation. What we need is a strong middle class, but that is a problem that is not solved with education - we need some social \u0026amp; political reform to do that.\n2. There's no indication that quality of education is really driving countries wealth up. Chinese education is nowhere near even current Russian one, even after all their attempts, but China is in top 2 world economies, and they reached it through cheap labor force, not better education.","score":"1","subreddit":"europe"}

{"body":"On the contrary, there is a political will and legal framework to NOT deport those that were denied asylum and it's called [Duldung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duldung_(Aufenthaltsrecht)). Just because a legal figure exists, it doesn't mean that this is what happens to everyone. So we have to look at the numbers: To get the numbers, one can do a quick google search that the numbers reflect this.\n\n[According to Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%BCchtlingskrise_in_Deutschland_ab_2015) over a million refugees have arrived in 2015. Since \"over a million\" isn't a specific number, we'll just assume it's 1 000 000 (although it's actually more). Of those [21 000 were deported and 40 000 left voluntarily](http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-01/abschiebungen-asylbewerber-nordrhein-westfalen-bayern). So, less than 2,1% were deported least year, and 4% left voluntarily. That makes 6,1% of the total arrivals.\n\nYou can have a look [here](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Meldungen/DE/2016/201610106-asylgeschaeftsstatistik-dezember.html) at asylum numbers. But those are just intermediary steps: and what truly matters is how many arrive and how many leave.\n\nNow, that should be enough, but one could argue \"I'm sure that more people will get deported soon!\"; well, let's get back to the numbers of the BAMF: Germany still can't process as many cases as people arrive (48k vs 43k in December 2015, a this number has been rising steadily). Keep in mind \"over a million arrivals\" only 476k asked for Asylum. But in December 7995 were denied Asylum and in the entire year 21 000 were deported. Even if the infrastructure is created to deport four times as many it would still not be enough: if 8 000 are denied asylum every month, that'd make a total of 96 000 per year that would have to be deported.\n\nSo what happens to the people that do not get asylum in one way or another (that's 28,3% of the processed asylum claims in December)?\n\nWhich reminds me of your bullshit claim\n\n\u0026gt;In Germany over 90% is denied asylum.\n\n(The truth is that 70% of the cases processed got Asylum in December 2015 according to the Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge, so I'd like to see your source)\n\nSince they're not getting deported at a sufficient rate, you guessed it, they get the Duldung.\n\nTL;DR: /u/Vertitto is pretty much right.","score":"2","subreddit":"europe"}

{"body":"The money is going towards the exorbitant healthcare costs of the middle-aged and elderly, on top of the costs of the younger crowd who purchased a plan when they were sick, and dropped it once the insurance covered their illnesses. It doesn't help that most of these premiums have a maximum threshold which the insurance companies can charge, all but ensuring that these insurance companies would have a large, unprofitable customer base. The original \"plan,\" according to the ACA's architects, was to have the losses covered by the premiums of younger customers who would actually use their insurance at a much lower rate. But why would younger citizens, many of whom have been suffering under a shitty job market and awful wages, buy something they would hardly use? Like I did while I was in school, many choose to eat the penaltax (thanks, Roberts) rather than spend more money on a barely used, God-awful insurance plan. Honestly, there was no way for this plan to work, which *may* have been the Dems intention from the outset.\n\nThink about it. Enact a plan that reaps immediate benefits to a large group of people, and delays the costs of these benefits until later down the road. Think of all the voters who were \"mad stoked\" that they now were covered either under their parent's plans, or the few that actually purchased the once dirt-cheap plans in the exchanges. The results were immediate: the uninsured group plummeted \"thanks to\" Obama and the Dems, guaranteeing a group of loyalist voters who were bought with this insurance.\n\nNow the aftermath is setting in. The exchanges are failing due to skyrocketing insurance costs, and many of these companies are slowly realizing there is no way they will ever realize profits through these exchanges. They're leaving. The exchanges will now crumble,  by design, perhaps, giving Dems yet another strawman argument against the \"free market\" and allowing Dems to push for what they have wanted all along: a single payer system.","score":"5","subreddit":"Libertarian"}

Any agreement negotiated in advance, regardless of the terms, is by definition \"fair\" so long as all provisions are contractually observed. If the process should ever reveal itself to be somehow unfair or not to the expectation of any party, as a free nation, they are free to terminate the contract and withdraw from the treaty.

But I don't think it's true that competitive, open markets has always been around. Instead we see a great deal of mercantilism, and cronyism. \n\n\u0026gt;Historically, christianity has not been very good to freedom of speech. \n\nWe'll agree to disagree, since Christianity has been used to justify all kinds of changes, but changes *towards* more expansive rights has been the more recent and lasting push. The free exercise of religion and speech were very much part of this.\n\n\u0026gt;Because I think the root of capitalism is greed and selfishness.\n\nAbsolute nonsense. Pick up *The Bourgeois Virtues*, then get back to me. Do you think my friends, my dad, or my collaborators started business out of selfishness? No. They were passionate about something and thought they could do it better. Sure, they want a decent living too, but should we call that greed? \n\nYou're painting with a ridiculously broad brush. If you just mean corporations, which ones? Big ones? How big? Etc. You're going down a slipper slope. Generalities suck.\n\n\u0026gt;When charity occurs in a capitalist system, it is because of a socialist influence working against people's selfishness\n\nThat's not a \"socialist influence\", that's genuine charitably, which is an emergent feature of cooperate evolution - see the Gintis book. Moreover, it's logically *not* a \"socialist influence\" because socialism is just the phenomenon of state-owned capital. A desire to give has absolutely nothing to do with determining whether the state should own capital. \n\n\u0026gt; rather the organized compassion that underlies the welfare systems of western Europe.\n\nThen you have terminology mixup. Let's stick with canonical definitions, otherwise we lose precision or risk equivocation. Besides, I've already outlined that capitalism absolutely accommodates the *welfare state*. You only make my point by pointing to Euro economies. \n\n\u0026gt;but inevitably the use of free speech will start to hurt someone's profit margin, creating an economic motive to destroy free speech.\n\nFree Speech *must* hurt a profit margin? Isn't that an empirical claim? I don't see a concerted effort to virtually end free speech by all companies everywhere. In fact countless companies encourage it, and economically benefiting from it! I work for some of them in IT. I've worked at companies trying to disrupt the status quo because we know that other ones are failing their customers. That's competition at work. \n\nCapitalism *rewards* free speech. Capitalism allows companies to *profit* from free speech. What happens when consumers complain? Sure, some companies want to suppress that; for others it's an opportunity to compete. Again, refer to the *virtues* book. \n\nFinal aside: as someone who programs for a living and majored in philosophy and economics, I'm dumbfounded by the silly assertions you edifice your political philosophy. I think you should take intermediate micro, public finance, and econometrics, *then* get back to me on what market economies actually are, how they function, and why they're so damn successful.

{"body":"The one time I visited a Quaker church I think they were some kind of different variety. \n\nAbout a year or two ago my Mother and I stopped at our neighborhood grocery store when I noticed a small church that said \"Chicago Monthly Quaker Meeting.\" Intrigued, I thought I'd step in. It was a bare, brick house decorated with papier-mâché trees and jungle animals that made it look like a pseudo forest. I wasn't expecting that. All the people were crowded around the back wall of the building (where in a church I'm used to there would be an altar) and a young woman was playing a song on tiny keyboard and most of the people were singing but one person would say something and then would cry and then everyone would crowd together and hug. This went on for just about the whole congregation of 15-30 people. Eventually they wrapped up the service and it was just everyone hugging and crying and me like off in the front entrance, trying to understand what I just saw. I had known the basics of what a Quaker service was like because I had a neighbor my freshman year of college who told me about her time at a Quaker high school in PA, and this was nothing like it. I wish I could remember any of the words to the song the keyboard lady was playing but most if not all of it was in Spanish. The one thing though, that I respected deeply, was that the kids of the congregation were better Christians than I was, hands down (and I don't mean that like in 'oh look how much of a humble humanitarian I am I'm just SO humble' like my God they were). Everyone wanted to meet me and shake hands with me after the service, and three little ones waited their turn to do the same. The keyboard lady I take it was in some sort of leadership position and she invited me to their barbecue. My Mom was still waiting for me in the grocery store so I declined to eat but I did stay and chat. The little girls actually took me by the hands outside and they were excited to talk to me in Spanish and I know like high school Spanish and rudimentary Portuguese and Italian so I mean I got a little of it (eh who am I kidding not really) but they were just so excited to walk me around the barbecue and just talk. When I had to go, the three girls gathered around me for a hug.

I wasn't stranger danger to them (I know if I was their age I wouldn't let anyone near me), they all held my hand like a friend.

So when one person of the Trinity is acting, it is also true, in some sense that we only understand very faintly, that the entire being of God is acting. This is because of what is sometimes called perichoresis, that each of the persons of the Trinity is somehow present “in” the other two persons. Jesus said, “the Father is in me and I am in the Father (John 10:38).  \n(2) In another sense, each of the members of the Trinity fully agrees with the actions of any member of the Trinity. Thus, when the Father sent the Son into the world, both Father and Son wholly agreed with that action, and so did the Holy Spirit. \n\nI.e. \"Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are also inseparable in what they do\" - He doesn't believe there to be a conflict of will, and there is a sense in which all members of the trinity are involved in every action each person does \"Because of that unity the Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son.\"\n\nBut also it's not proper to assign certain actions to certain members of the trinity - as \"each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity\" and again the church rightly rejected patripassianism.","score":"2","subreddit":"Christianity"}

By his sin, he allowed death to spread to everyone, because everyone is a sinner.  You could think of this as literal death, or as spiritual death.\n\n\u0026gt;15 But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. 16 And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. 17 For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. \n\nWe're contrasting Jesus' obedience to Adam's disobedience.  If we are all condemned because of Adam, how much more will Jesus, our new Adam, redeem us by his obedience.\n\n\u0026gt;18 Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. 19 For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous. 20 Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, 21 so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nThis is really the key part.

There is a strong point of commonality: Instead of investigating the differences between terms and concepts, you'd rather lump everything together in the silliest possible way. I.e.\n\nWhen evolution deniers say \"My grandpa wasn't no monkey!\" as a rebuttal, they are reducing what evolutionary biology says to absurd terms--not engaging with the actual ideas, but playing around with how odd it sounds. You're doing the *exact* same thing, but with philosophy instead of science.\n\n\"Official Catholic Doctrine\" such as it is requires either more or less unanimous consent of the Church Fathers or the Magisterium infallibly defining it. Limbo ***never*** had either of those: It was conceived of as speculation in the middle ages, it was written of speculation, the Magisterium never spoke of it. It is still licit to believe in as speculation, but recently the Church has doubted it more than they did previously. \n\n\u0026gt; Indulgences were sold for cash, but not Officially\n\nI mean in that it was always illegal to sell indulgences, *I don't see what your problem is here*.

In your haste for a reductio ad absurdum I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.\n\n\u0026gt; Purgatory is a place with a time limit of thousands of years (or maybe the time is just a metaphor).\n\nBecause it has always been believed that purgatory is outside of time, it was always agreed upon that the \"times\" you see associated with it are about severity of punishment. That doesn't mean it's a metaphor, it means aside from the unit of time, we don't have a good way of explaining something that happens outside of time. Do you? No, I didn't expect so.\n\n\u0026gt; This is no salvation outside the church, but maybe people are members of the church and don't even know it.\n\nAgain, you're reducing pretty interesting philosophical claims until they sound silly: But I promise I can do that twice as well to anything you believe. The fact of the matter is we believe that salvation outside of the Church isn't possible, but it's self-evidently not correct to identify the church with the visible Church. Therefore, it is not impossible that some will be saved who are not members of the visible Church.\n\n\u0026gt; You offer saints dulia, not patria.\n\nAnd you honor (dulia) your mother and father and yet you aren't confused whether or not you think your mom is God.

I can tell you exactly the times a Pope has spoken ex cathedra in recent memory: it is twice.\n\n\u0026gt; The Mass isn't a separate sacrifice, but a re-presentation of the original sacrifice.\n\nAgain, it's a shame there's some really interesting philosophy here, and you're dismissing it out of hand because...? you don't want to think about difficult ideas? The Mass is a window to Calvary, that is, through God's power and his timelessness we gain access to the original sacrifice of Jesus. Well, what otherwise?

Elsewhere in that section I covered other ones, too. (The other main one was something like \"just a metaphor for/illustration of how God punishes sin, non-eschatologically.\")\n\n\u0026gt;I was interested by the idea of the 'pillars' of water and fire, corresponding to primeval and future judgements. Do you think that's where the idea of 'baptism of fire' comes from in the gospels? In 1 Peter the flood is seen as a foreshadowing of baptism by water, but I'm also wondering if he sees it as foreshadowing a 'baptism of fire' that will come in the end times, through which only a few are saved.\n\nThat's an interesting question! Honestly, though, I don't think there's any real connection there. I think the baptism/ark connection is pretty idiosyncratic and probably unique to 1 Peter (outside of later patristic texts which relied on it, naturally). Basically I think that in the water/fire cataclysm motif, both elements there are destructive/negative, whereas with John's imagery of baptism it's a *positive* (water) and then a negative (fire). Presuming, of course, that the baptism of fire indeed has to do with eschatological judgment -- which seems highly likely.","score":"2","subreddit":"Christianity"}

Kasich did not increase taxes to expand Medicaid...\n\nNo. He just ballooned the state's budget in order to do it. http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/426782/medicaid-expansion-proving-be-budget-buster-we-predicted-veronique-de-rugy\n\nFrom the piece:\n\n\u0026gt;Even Ohio, whose Republican Gov. John Kasich is running for president on a platform of fiscal responsibility, finds itself in a Medicaid bind. State spending on the program has grown by $5.8 billion since 2011. The Ohio Department of Medicaid projects that by 2017 spending will total $28.2 billion—a 59% increase during Mr. Kasich’s tenure.\n\n\n\u0026gt;What debt has Ohio added? The expansion has been fully funded by the Feds and Ohio's debt has been UPGRADED under Kasich...\n\nSee the National Review article. You're conflating reducing the debt with increased spending. You can spend more and decrease debt if you accrue enough revenue to offset your expenditures.\n\n\u0026gt;Because Common Core is not the boogeyman that people make it out to be and actually leaves a ton of wiggle room for states to adjust to their needs.\n\nOh, so now you're in favor of Common Core. Why didn't you just say that? I disagree with Common Core in the sense that the federal legislature would be proposing education standards. If you want a national level of education standard, then we need to call for Article V, convention of states, and propose an amendment with regards to national education expectations. This way, the states can debate on what should be included in these expectations, and what shouldn't be; not some politicians in Washington.\n\nA lot of the other points, I think we're at an impasse. I've already explained his statist positions, and we're now talking in circles. I'm not painting him as a total leftist, but he hasn't been the most conservative governor of all time. He may have cut down the debt with added tax revenues from good economic policies (and I've already mentioned how that's a good thing. It's one of the things he did particularly well in Ohio. His tax and economic policies helped bring Ohio from an $8 billion hole to the $2 billion surplus.), but he increased government spending in the process. http://watchdog.org/229670/ohio-government-spending-up/\n\n\u0026gt;Due to programs like Medicare and SS growing extremely fast and inflation, the amount is actually just under 10 Trillion.\n\nAh, so it's even more than I had perceived. To make the math simple, I was just taking the current budget deficit and multiplying it by 10 years. Apparently, I should have multiplied by 20.\n\n\u0026gt;You are reading that analysis wrong. It is stating that on a static level Paul's plan adds ANOTHER 2 trillion to already projected deficits. So his plan actually adds 12 Trillion to the debt. So it actually gets further away from a balanced budget.\nIf you look at it from a dynamic standpoint it decreases future deficits by 700BN. So instead of adding 10 Trillion to the debt, it only adds about 9 Trillion. Better than nothing, but still not a balanced budget\n\nI had the feeling we weren't on the same page somewhere because your responses seemed like they were trying to make a different argument from what I was talking about. I think we found the disconnect here.\n\nI went over that analysis again, and I don't see where it says that. Paul's proposal was for a balanced budget, not a deficit neutral budget. That's what the Washington Times article was addressing with regards to Paul's plan. I actually think it might be you who is reading the analysis incorrectly. From what I gathered, they were saying that on a static level, Paul's plan would add $2 trillion to the debt, not the deficit, the debt over a ten year period, and that would be expensive; it wouldn't be nearly as expensive as the current trajectory, but expensive nonetheless.\n\nI would be pretty surprised if a Libertarian like Rand Paul would actually propose a fiscal plan that would add $12 trillion to the debt over a ten year period, especially since he is always talking about auditing the Fed and establishing fiscal responsibility. His plan involved slashing a lot of government programs, and he proposed entitlement reform in order to combat the inflation that you mentioned, and he also talked about reducing military spending (I'm a veteran, and military spending needs to be checked. We could actually expand the size of the military and spend less on it if done right), which is the largest portion of the annual budget.\n\n","score":"1","subreddit":"Conservative"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; Are you shitting me?\n\nAre YOU shitting me? \n\nNo? Okay let me spell it out for you.\n\n----\n\nRemember we were talking about freedom of press. \n\nLet's take your dead intern's case. First of all he's a whistle blower, not a journalist so entire different set of rules are in force. Did he apply for whistle blower protection? Whatever, let's move on.\n\nSecondly, he leaked to wikileaks which is not a recognised press house of any sort, so again, no freedom of press affected yet.\n\nSo he's dead. That's murder, or suicide or something. Is it being investigated by police? Again, not a freedom of press matter.\n\nThe matter that pisses you off is the lack of reporting on the issue. Now here is the big kahuna: is the lack of reporting due to govt requirement NOT to report... or because the MSM choose NOT to report, for whatever reason?\n\nIf you can PROVE that there has been a govt gag order, only THEN is there a freedom of press issue. If MSM choose not to report due to financial interest... that's a ethical issue but NOT a freedom of press issue.\n\nThat's because there is NO law preventing you from opening your own press house in any medium, and relaying this very news 24x7. No Govt gag order preventing YOU from doing so.\n\n----\n\nNow compare with Pakistan. Let's not even get into whistle blower protection laws (or lack thereof) here. \n\nWe have a firm tradition of presses getting banned and gagged going back decades. The call from Aabpara is enough to freeze even the biggest of press houses in its tracks. There were times every day's print had to be vetted.\n\nTrue, after Musharraf, there have been a general relaxation of press. But to assume the press has a *carte blanche* would be very disingenuous. Even within his own reign, many press freedoms were curtailed under various guises.\n\nThere are still topics that are verboten. The scores of journalists killed are not the only instances of suppressed stories, merely the most visible elements. Most simply fall in line.\n\nWe still have blanks when it comes to many \"critical\" areas, many arbitrarily defined, especially our multitude of wars. \n\nThe very concept of registration, monitoring and banning by a government organisation like PEMRA is alien to a free press, which are self regulated.\n\n----\n\nThe US (from your example) does not have the most free press (even freedom house only ranks it like 30-ish) but to compare it to Pakistan is laughable.\n","score":"1","subreddit":"pakistan"}

Οπότε λοιπόν, το πρόβλημα είναι: \n\n* ότι το 22% για την Ελλάδα είναι μεγαλύτερο από την πραγματική επισκεψιμότητα αυτών των sites στη χώρα μας;\n* ότι η επισκεψιμότητα αυτών των sites δεν είναι ίση με το ποσοστό των χρηστών που επιδίδεται σε πειρατεία;\n* ότι το αποτέλεσμα είναι \"μαγειρεμένο\" γιατί η MUSO συμπεριλαμβάνει sites που δεν είναι η βασική τους δραστηριότητα η διανομή πειρατικού υλικού;\n* ότι η 6η θέση παγκοσμίως για την Ελλάδα είναι μεγαλύτερη/μικρότερη από αυτό που πιστεύεις/περιμένεις;\n* ότι η MUSO \"μαγειρεύει\" το ποσοστό επισκεψιμότητας αυτών των sites συγκεκριμένα για την Ελλάδα;\n\nΟπότε ποια είναι η φυσική σημασία του 22% που σε απασχολεί και θέλεις να το αμφισβητήσεις; Αν ήταν 10% θα σήμαινε κάτι διαφορετικό για σένα; Αν ήταν 50%; \n\nΘα ήσουν λιγότερο διατεθειμένος να το αμφισβητήσεις αν ήταν κάποιο από αυτά τα νούμερα; Τι σημαίνει δηλαδή για σένα αυτό το ποσοστό; \n\nΗ ουσία, δηλαδή ποια είναι; Η πειρατεία είναι λιγότερη απ'ό,τι ακούγεται γενικά ή συγκεκριμένα από τη MUSO; (πρόσεξε: κανένα επιχείρημα αχυρανθρώπου, όπως το δικό μου \"καπέλο από αλουμινόχαρτο\" και το δικό σου \"αποκλείεται να λέει ψέμματα\"). Ότι η πειρατεία δεν είναι πραγματικό πρόβλημα; Ότι η πειρατεία δεν είναι δικό μου/σου πρόβλημα;\n\nΉ μήπως είναι ότι αφού με συμφέρει θα πρέπει να φαίνεται ότι είμαι εναντίον σε ό,τι προσπαθεί να το καταπολεμήσει; Είναι άλλο πράγμα να κάνει κανείς σιωπηλά την κουτσουκέλα του (όπως την έχουμε λίγο πολύ κάνει όλοι μας) στο θέμα της πειρατείας, από mp3, ταινίες, σειρές, λογισμικό μέχρι και CD και DVD από μαύρους στις πλατείες, και άλλο πράγμα να κάνει τον αδικημένο, γιατί ή είναι αθώος, ή γιατί πιστεύει ότι θα έπρεπε να μην είναι παράνομο ό,τι τον συμφέρει.

{"body":"Budskapet her kan jo like gjerne være at man ikke skal utføre seksuelle handlinger med en partner som er (be)ruset. Uavhengig av hvor mye partneren er pådriver for den seksuelle handlingen.\n\nÅrsaken til at de tre mennene ble frikjent er at de (påstår at de) ikke oppfattet jenten som bevisstløs - tvert imot er det fortalt at de oppfattet jenten som \"den aktive parten\". \n\nDet er heller ingen som har påstått at jenten ikke frivillig tok rusmidlene som hun ble dopet ned på - vel vitende om at det var rusmidler. Selv om hun har blitt påvirket av de tre mennene til å ta disse rusmidlene, så er det fortsatt ett valg hun har tatt, og hun kan ikke automatisk pushe ansvaret over på de tre mennene når utfallet ikke ble slik hun ønsket. Kan også minne om at alle de tre mennene også tok det samme rusmiddelet (de samme kapslene) som jenten tok. Det er riktignok opplyst om fra mennene at kapslene hadde varierende doser, men samtidig viste også testen dagen etter at jenten hadde inntatt kokain. Dette benekter både jenten og mennene. Personlig anser jeg det sannsynlig at det gjerne var kokain blandet inn sammen med MDMA i kapslene. Dette tyder på at mennene ikke har hatt full oversikt over hva som har vært i kapslene. \n\nDet de tre mennene har gjort er gjerne moralsk forkastelig - men det lagmansretten har avgjort er at det ikke er en forsettelig voldtekt i begrepets juridiske forstand. En rekke personer innenfor jussen peker dog på at uaktsomhetsspørsmålet her skulle vært vurdert. \n\nDette er en veldig viktig dom som viser behovet for at vi innfører lover som fanger opp slike saker som dette. Istedet ender vi opp med en lynsjestemning og en videreføring av status quo. Sakens progresjon og håndtering av media er mildt sagt kritikkverdig. \n","score":"8","subreddit":"norge"}

Nei, det jeg skrev var:\n \n\u0026gt; Uten å ha lest altfor nøye om saken, så var vel det gjeldende spørsmålet om de tiltalte visste at hun hadde tatt så mye MDMA at hun ikke var i stand til å samtykke til sex.\n \nNoe som bør indikere for hvem som helst at dette ikke er en meningsytring, men en gjengivelse av hva som er blitt publisert i media.\n \n\u0026gt; Noe som er sludder, hva de vet og ikke er irrelevant for hvorvidt samtykke gis eller ikke.\n \nJeg antar at du snakker om de tiltalte? I såfall så er jo ikke det irrelevant om de visste at hun hadde fått i seg for mye MDMA, det er jo det som tydeligvis har vært avgjørende for skyldspørsmål.

Hva skal dommerene da basere seg på?\n \n\u0026gt; At du så later som at du ikke sa dette og påpeker at de i rettsalen hevder å ha fått samtykke er, meh; ikke det minste overbevisende.\n \nIgjen, jeg later aldeles ikke som jeg ikke har skrevet det, men du er for tett til å skjønne at jeg gjengir kun det som er skrevet i media.

Ausência de antecedentes criminais? Bom comportamento? Rotina? Resiliência? \n\nPois bem! Tenho todos estes requisitos! Passo o dia todo olhando para a boca das pessoas! Isso mesmo! Sou dentista! Não existe nada mais alienante e tecnicista do que isso! Não é necessário cogitar, contestar ou deduzir nada sobre nenhuma situação, basta ter experiência para restaurar adequadamente o que se danificou, repetitivamente, dia após dia, sem que nada se acrescente ou se remova das convicções do paciente. \n\nNinguém se levanta da cadeira do dentista com uma ideia nova ou uma visão diferente da realidade, ninguém vai ao dentista para adquirir conhecimento. Pelo contrário, pessoas vão ao dentista a contragosto, por uma questão de necessidade ou emergência. \n\nPortanto, não sou um sujeito perigoso. Sou apenas, digamos assim, constantemente intrigado. Minha capacidade intelectual é mediana, reconheço! Talvez seja isso que me impede de compreender o conceito de democracia. \n\nO que é a democracia? Tenho votado, anos após anos, escolhendo candidatos para os mais diversos cargos em várias eleições, desde vereadores até presidente da república, e o resultado de tudo isso se parece mais com aquele jogo infantil da dança das cadeiras em que o último a se sentar perde o lugar. \n\nDepois deste tempo todo, percebi que o fato de o eleitor remover a cadeira de alguém que não lhe agrada para oferecer a outro que, possivelmente venha a gostar, através do seu sacrossanto voto, não caracteriza nenhum tipo de conquista concreta ou palpável. Talvez, num país com problemas não tão graves como os do Brasil, esta sensação não seja a mesma. Não sei. Pelo menos aqui, o que mais tenho visto é a repetição das mazelas que se sonhávamos eliminadas através da democratização do país. \n\nA desigualdade continua abissal. Temos um país dividido com negros e pardos superlotando as cadeias, enquanto que juízes, promotores, delegados, profissionais liberais, empresários e proprietários de terra são, na grande maioria, brancos. Nos bailes de formatura é nítida a diferença entre aqueles que ostentam a beca e os que servem canapés. \n\nAs periferias permanecem violentas, sem saneamento básico e sem nenhum tipo de assistência. Genocídios de índios são ignorados pela imprensa, desmatamentos, latifúndios improdutivos, má distribuição de renda, educação precária e serviços de saúde de baixa qualidade já não nos comovem. \n\nNa verdade, não vejo nenhuma discussão séria a respeito das drogas. Por que algumas são legalizadas e outras não? \n\nPor que não existe autonomia do individuo para decidir onde deseja ver o dinheiro dos seus impostos investido? \n\nPor que o cidadão não pode interferir no destino da escola da pública? \n\nPor que os usuários do serviço de saúde não podem decidir pela contratação de médicos e na utilização dos recursos disponíveis? \n\nPor que os controles de gastos não são transparentes e compartilhados? \n\n\nNo meu entender, democracia seria isso! Colocar a tecnologia a serviço do cidadão comum. Aliás, é a tecnologia que tem melhorado a qualidade de vida dos indivíduos, e não os políticos. Carros, aviões,televisão, telefone, remédios, internet, tudo isso, só existe por intermédio da comunidade científica. \n\nPor que, então, não disponibilizar de forma livre e democrática o conhecimento científico através da internet e desenvolver um sistema de fiscalização e tomada de decisões. \n\nProvavelmente seria esta nova concepção de realidade que desencadeou o surgimento de ativistas contemporâneos como Aaron Swartz,Edward Snowden,Julian Assange,Ross Ulbricht e etc. Estas pessoas, na verdade, estão à frente do nosso tempo e provavelmente só terão reconhecimento num livro de história de um futuro remoto. \n\nEu, porém, sou apenas um cidadão comum desnorteado com tudo isso.

{"body":"Thanks for your reply. I'm getting kind of strident about this issue because I'm tired of being treated as some kind of irresponsible maniac just because my risk tolerance is higher than average. EVERYONE is making risk tradeoffs, all the time, and it's really frustrating when people deny it and act as though their particular risk tradeoffs are actually some kind of moral imperative. I'm willing to talk about things and make compromises, but \"vision zero\" is all about removing conversation and compromise from the table, instead enforcing a single, extremely conservative standard of risk on all of us. And I just can't get on board with that.\n\nI currently live a block from where you did, on MLK. Before that I lived at 24th \u0026amp; Cherry, before that 23rd \u0026amp; Republican, before that up by Lee... so for at least a decade now, essentially every trip anywhere in Seattle has begun by getting on 23rd. I still use 23rd as my main arterial, because there's nothing on MLK worth driving to, and it's really, really slow. With only a single lane, you inevitably get stuck behind some lumbering bus, or one of those inexplicable 20 mph slowpokes who doesn't care about the long line of cars they're blocking up, and there's nothing you can do about it. So I'd always just jet over to 23rd instead, where I used to be able to pass those suckers and actually move at a comfortable pace.\n\nNow that they're nerfing 23rd so you can't pass the slowpokes anymore, so it's going to be just as slow and useless a road as MLK has been, which makes all destinations in SoDo, the International District, and Beacon Hill take that much longer to get to. The whole south end of the city is becoming farther away because I have to spend more time poking along at a low speed to get there.\n\nOn top of that, they're talking about nerfing Madison just as badly, with this \"BRT\" project. It's bad enough that Madison has all those parking zones but still, there are enough stretches of dual lanes that you can pass the slowpokes and actually get somewhere. With the road diet for Madison BRT, all that is going away. So all destinations on southern Capitol Hill, First Hill, and downtown will become further away. \"Yes but you'll get to ride the new bus service!\" - well who fucking cares, the bus is slow and uncomfortable and late. Either way, I'm going to lose, because it's going to take longer to travel west whether I'm struggling along in worse traffic or struggling along dealing with the goddamn bus.\n\nNorthern Capitol Hill has already become nearly off limits since there's noplace to park. Ride the bus? Ugh, it's uncomfortable, unreliable, and takes three times as long as driving there, which means... once again... everything is effectively further away.\n\nI don't really care if 23rd is walkable because it's all houses, except for those one or two shops down south by Union, and I can't walk there from here anyway, since there's a big-ass hill in the way. If I want to go hiking up big-ass hills I'm going to drive east and climb a pretty one out in the Cascades; I'm not going to sweat my way up a hill just to buy some fucking groceries. In fact there are big-ass hills on all three sides of my neighborhood. Walkability, good luck. I'm pretty much stuck with driving if I want to go anywhere that isn't Madison Valley, and with zero prospect of getting any decent transit service around here, that's going to be true for the indefinite future. So, slowing down auto access is *all downside* for me.\n\nSo, yeah. I regard the current rate of death and danger involved in auto travel as an acceptable price to pay for what we're getting. I, personally, am willing to take even greater risks than the normal ones; I'm a motorcyclist after all. So reducing the amount of risk involved buys me nothing, while slowing down my access to the rest of the city - thereby making the city I live in smaller and less valuable - costs me something I barely had enough of to begin with.","score":"1","subreddit":"Seattle"}

Sure, suburbanites are spending a lot of their own money on parking garages that won't be much of an improvement from Sound Transit express bus service, but the level of mobility within the urban area will be kind of incredible. Every rapid ride gets loads of improvements, every frequent bus becomes rapid ride, with dedicated lanes wherever there's ever any traffic. Every infrequent (30m off peak) bus becomes frequent (10-15m) and runs later. Every commuter-only bus becomes a regular route. With almost every neighborhood now served by a light rail station, our transit will no longer be hub and spoke through downtown. Right now, the only way for me to get from one part of West Seattle to another is usually by going downtown first, which with the WSB and 99, is incredibly unreliable. Buses will connect to the nearest Link station, and serve the neighborhoods in a far more gridded, efficient, and ground-covering way, needing not to ever get on a highway.

{"body":"Why a “True Labour” splinter party could succeed where the SDP failed\nAug 12th 2016, 15:43 BY BAGEHOT\n\nLABOUR is in the midst of a roller-coaster leadership election. Today a court ruled that the 130,000 people who have joined the party since January (most of them supporters of Jeremy Corbyn) will not be able to vote. That is a blow to the party’s far-left leader, but he will probably still win. So it remains incumbent on Labour’s MPs—who with their surgeries and door-knocking have a much better grip on political reality than their leader and his well-heeled base—to contemplate a future without him.\n\nRegular readers of this blog and my print column will know that I have long called on Labour’s MPs to contemplate ditching their leader. Yet even before today’s ruling an overwhelming majority of them strongly disagreed. Their objections go something like this. “Under First Past the Post, splitting the party’s vote would give the Tories and UKIP a clear run at 100+ Labour seats. And why should those of us who have been Labour all our lives be forced abandon it? The far left has been defeated before and it will be again. Just look at the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which by splitting off from Labour in 1981 helped keep it out of power for another 16 years; without much electoral success to show for its efforts.”\n\nThe analysis exudes reason and decency. It is also wrong. Partly because the assumption that the SDP held Labour back is unconvincing. In practice, as is often forgotten, the splinter took more votes from the Tories than it did from Labour. Moreover, it also exerted the sort of external pressure on the party’s right flank that helped the likes of Neil Kinnock make the case for change from within. And it incubated the party’s moderate tradition (Roy Jenkins, for example, came to be a mentor to Tony Blair).\n\nAnd in any case, the objections are a giant category error. References to the SDP are simply otiose.\n\nFirst, the Labour Party’s situation now is substantially grimmer than it was in 1981. Michael Foot was a better politician than Mr Corbyn: cleverer, more intellectually heterodox and a better speaker. In 1980 he beat Denis Healey, his moderate rival, by just 52% to 48%. Last year Mr Corbyn took 59% of the vote against three rivals—a figure on which, if nominations by local party branches are anything to go by (they usually are), he may improve in the current leadership election. Meanwhile most unions, which in the 1980s were moderate and integral to Labour’s salvation, are today in the hands of the left. And social media makes it much easier for the hard left to organise and consolidate than it was back then: Momentum is Militant with a Facebook account and a sympathetic media eco-system (think Novara, The Canary and other blinkered but popular pro-Corbyn websites, their reach amplified by the echo chambers of Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat). In this context, moderate assumptions that the reconquista can be as quick and successful as that of Mr Kinnock, John Smith and Mr Blair look wildly optimistic.\n\nSecond, the chances of a new party succeeding are better than they were in 1981. Britain is a much less deferential and rigid country than it was then. Voters are more fickle. Fewer define themselves according to the party for which they vote. The rise of the UK Independence Party illustrates the electorate’s willingness to break from established parties. In other words: a new Labour breakaway need not crumble on contact with voters’ fixed loyalties as the SDP did.\n\nThird, and most importantly: the degree of alienation of Labour’s MPs from its leadership today is almost incomparably greater than it was in the 1980s. Most of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet has resigned. If he wins the leadership contest he has no chance of reconstituting a full shadow ministerial line up (if you include junior ministers). Unlike Foot he has suffered a vote of no confidence endorsed by over three-quarters of his MPs.\n\nMy point is that enough MPs despair of Mr Corbyn to split off, refound the party and annihilate its remaining, far-left rump. The problem is that the vast majority also seethe about the SDP splitters in the 1980s, see Labour as family and adore its history and tradition. That is understandable. Yet is it really truer to the party’s founding mission—to provide representation for working people—to look on as Labour systematically alienates those it was meant to serve? The most optimistic projection put to me by the anti-splitting tendency is that, perhaps, over a decade or so, Labour can be made electable once more. This is dismal. And, anyway, a more pessimistic projection is probably more realistic: that, whole, the party will simply spin off into irrelevance; Britain as a sort of delayed Poland in which a social democratic party that obtained 41% of the vote 15 years ago shrivels into irrelevance, leaving behind a battle between liberals, conservatives and populists.\n\nThe alternative need not be as grim as those MPs imagine. If as many of them as despair about their leader quit, “Labour” will become rump of administratively incapable hard-liners, while True Labour (as we might call it) will inherit almost all of the party’s political talent. A defection on this scale would not work in the same way that the puny, 28-MP SDP one did a third of a century ago. There would follow a battle over whether “Labour” or True Labour actually owned Labour’s (1) pragmatic, social democratic heritage, (2) national voice, (3) local branches and (4) brand. If the 172 MPs who declared no confidence in Mr Corbyn in June sided with True Labour, this new party would automatically inherit (1) and (2), some of (3) and—with a successful legal challenge—most of (4). True Labour’s role would then not be to compete amicably with Mr Corbyn’s “Labour” but to marginalise or, ideally, destroy it by appropriating the Labour mantle through sheer weight, dynamism and persuasiveness. I see few reasons to believe that such a party would lack the talent, prominence, funding potential and organisational ability to do so.\n\nJust imagine:\n\nOn September 24th 2016, Jeremy Corbyn wins reelection. Within hours he moves to consolidate his control of the party. One-by-one, MPs start declaring their independence from their reelected leader; eventually over 150 have done so. Local Labour Parties begin to split along leader-rebels lines. Staffers in Labour’s headquarters formally disregard Mr Corbyn. A True Labour declaration of independence and social democratic principles is promoted by leading MPs and Labour grandees like Mr Kinnock. A majority of Labour MPs rally around it and appoint a True Labour interim leader and shadow cabinet sporting the best of the party's parliamentary talent (perhaps: Angela Eagle as leader, Rachel Reeves as shadow chancellor, Tom Watson as a continuity deputy leader).\n\nTrue Labour obtains recognition from John Bercow as the official opposition. Donors are sought and local branches established. These swallow the moderate segments of Constituency Labour Parties and welcome a flood of centre-left and centrist members, including many previously unaligned voters politicised by the Brexit vote. The new opposition leader, Angela Eagle, discards Mr Corbyn’s unelectable stances and puts real pressure on Theresa May. Conservative splits over Europe start to fracture the government. True Labour becomes more confident and prominent as “Labour”, despite its many loyalists, sinks into chaotic infighting and—unrestrained by moderates— alights on even more looney policies. Come the 2020 election, True Labour is a competitive force, while “Labour” looks like a pressure group posing as a political party and, with few locally active door-knockers and a dysfunctional leadership, sinks into irrelevance.\n\n- -\n\nAs things stand this is not a realistic scenario. But only because Labour MPs are too frit to make it a reality. Most recognise its desirability. But most are also hidebound by their tribal commitment to the “party” currently run by Jeremy Corbyn. They struggle to accept that Labour is more than its institutional carapace and that to reestablish it as a formidable electoral force is not to abandon it, but to save it and the best of its tradition. If Mr Corbyn wins the current leadership election Labour MPs must choose between two futures for their party: decades of infighting that may or may not generate an electable social democratic force or a painful but effective break that would immediately generate an electable social democratic force. The future is in their hands.","score":"12","subreddit":"ukpolitics"}

This will result in many employers terminating the contracts of those family members because they are not a 'good' family who did not raise a member properly and therefore cannot be trusted with anything. This will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Luckily thanks to nepotism, we can probably prevent that from ever happening (cash and influence changes a lot of laws in Korea).\n\nAlso the current system is filled with such nepotism that it is simply a horrendous little system that removes up to 2.5 years of lower class Korean citizens in utterly horrendous conditions (suicide rates are through the roof along with mental problems) while their own leadership (generals and politicians) do everything they can to ensure their children either do not have to do it (by giving birth in America - Dual citizenship ho!) or putting them in an office job.

{"body":"Residents are overworked, but I think the problem isn't necessarily the high baseline level of work they're supposed to accomplish, but that they're expected to pick up endless slack when there's a greater than average workload.\n\nThe amount of work that needs to get done in the hospital is inherently variable.  Some days there are more patients coming in, some days they are sicker, some days there are more social issues, and there's no great way to predict this.  It's interesting to compare how the health system works with other industries.  Your electricity utility knows that the demand for electricity is variable in unpredictable ways, and that some days (or hours, or weeks) there will be more demand than usual.  They know that if they have enough plants to produce exactly the average amount of demanded electricity, they'll fall short whenever demand is above that (which is half the time).  If they have enough capacity to supply two standard deviations more than average demand, they'd still have a day where they fell short once a month, which would be considered unacceptable.  Even three standard deviations would lead to a short day once a year, which would probably be too much given expectations in the modern industrialized world.\n\nElectricity utilities understand that they need 1) not to be operating their facilities at 100% during baseline demand, but to leave some spare capacity, and 2) to have a plan to either offload some demand (say, by asking some large industrial customers to turn down their AC) or else bring in extra capacity from elsewhere (say, by buying power from a neighboring utility).\n\nAs far as I can tell, neither of these things really happen in a smooth way for residents.  Regarding point 1, if residents are working substantially less than 80 hours per week at baseline, someone is likely to think they aren't getting enough work, and will give them more until they're basically at 80 all the time.  Then, when there's a busy shift, there's no wiggle room until you hit the cap, and residents are stuck in a shitty position.  Regarding point 2, while some systems do have a system whereby a team that's getting slaughtered can call in backup, the culture of residency and medicine seems to be such that this is considered a sign of personal and professional failure, and so as far as I can tell this almost never happens.\n\nSo, basically the situation is that the hospital administrators who make decisions about staffing and workload have done a poor job of planning and designing their system to work well in the face of fluctuating demand.  The burden of this poor planning falls squarely on the shoulders of the doctors, nurses, PAs, and various other medical professionals who are expected to scramble to make up the shortfalls that predictably pop up fairly often.\n\nWhat can we, as residents, do about this?  Probably not very much.  I think one important step is to always log duty hours honestly, including those that are more than 80 hours a week.  Administrators will only be motivated to change the system if they're well aware of the problem and are feeling some consequences, and if their program is frequently breaking duty hour limits it would be appropriate for them to 1) know this, and 2) have the ACGME or whoever give them a bit of grief.  I've heard a lot of residents at a lot of institutions say that they are told to just log 80 hours and not to document hours in excess of 80.  In any reasonable world, it would be inappropriate, unethical, and unprofessional for a program director or other administrator to encourage a resident to falsify their duty hours reporting forms.  It's probably illegal, and it certainly violates ACGME rules.  Don't let them get away with it.","score":"29","subreddit":"medicine"}

Nobody would-- especially not a group of money-grubbing wonks like the ABIM.\n\nThere's no need for MOC in any specialty, pathology included IMHO. No proof of need, no proof of efficacy-- it just gets more expensive and time consuming (the fees to recertify in IM have nearly doubled in less than 10 years with nothing to keep the fees from rising further other than the ABIM's nonexistent sense of fairness). The fact that the boards profit handsomely from the process is all the information anyone should need to understand why they are fighting so viciously to keep it going.\n\nI didn't know that about pathology grandfathering. If it only started in 2006, I would say that you're right about why you haven't had much pushback to it. Unfortunately, doctors are no less motivated by self-interest as your average person. The only ones who would have the political juice to fight something like this would be the already established members of your group-- but why would they bother to? It doesn't affect them. \n\nGrandfathering amounts to nothing more than a bribe. The boards only give it so they can make these changes without any resistance. Believe me, they would LOVE to make ALL previously certified docs recertify (that's a lot of money sitting in these grandfathers' pockets). The boards just know that they won't be able to because the established docs would fight a move like that (and win). We saw this with IM in the late 80's when they announced requiring recert-- but only starting in 1990. Nobody stood up to fight the change because the only people it would affect were the disenfranchised residents/students to come who didn't have a seat at the table yet. All established internists had no motivation to contest these changes and were just relieved that they got in under the wire. These grandfathers only started to complain 20+ years later when ABMS/ABIM announced that the grandfathers would be labelled as \"Certified - not meeting MOC requirements\" on all public websites starting in 2014. Even though they were still considered certified, they were being denigrated with the label of 'not meeting MOC requirements' unless they paid the ABIM for MOC. They didn't like that one bit and saw right through the ABIM's attempt to publicly shame them in order to shake them down for more certification fees. I think that was the moment that everybody in IM, grandfather and not, saw what we were up against and united to fight it.\n\nI would recommend that pathologists not wait another 16+ years to  get their specialty board under control.

There have been many times that, had I not had the emotional support of my family while dealing with my dog in these last few months, I probably would have had to throw in the towel and rehomed my dog just because I was so sure that I had made a mistake when I thought I could handle a dog. I have grown up with pets (cats, birds, fish, hamsters), spent several years dog sitting, and even fostered a dog for about a year. Plus I spent several months researching everything I could about what kind of dog I wanted and how to care for it. But none of those things really prepared me for dog ownership the way I thought they would.\n\nYou say your family is skeptical about getting a dog. You need to consider that even if your family says they are okay with you getting a dog now, how will they react when your dog has an accident? Or ten? My dog was fully housebroken when I got her but there were still times when I mistook her potty signal for something else, times when she got so excited she peed, and then she also spent several months on medication that increased her thirst drive and peeing (I spent a whole week doing nothing but cleaning pee, it was very memorable). How will they react the first time the dog misbehaves? We were incredibly diligent about not even letting the dog and cats see each other for the first month, but then one of us didn't close a door properly and the dog chased the cat. How long are you prepared to work with introducing the dog to your cat? I'm going on four months now of slow introductions and my pets are still nowhere near ready to be let loose around each other. My dog has anxiety issues and gets destructive in situations that trigger her anxieties (thunderstorms and being alone). She has chewed up a doorframe, scratched up a door, chewed up a door knob, has chewed up more phone cords than I can count, and destroyed a crate even though she is not destructive when her anxiety hasn't been triggered. I have often ended up in tears because I keep thinking that this will be the last straw and my mom will insist the dog needs to go. But she just says that while it isn't ideal, we just need to be patient and keep working with my dog because she is Our Dog. Will your family feel the same?\n\nIf you really want a dog, why don't you try fostering? That way you can get an idea of what kind of dog you want and you can see what it takes to take care of a dog. It will give you a chance for your entire family to become more comfortable with the idea of having a dog, and if you can't keep it that is okay because that's the point of fostering. Or you could dog sit or volunteer with an animal shelter/rescue group. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have everyone in your household completely behind the decision to get a dog. My mom said that these last few months of me having a dog has been very similar emotionally for me as when she had me as a first time mom. If you search online or even just on this reddit, you will find lots of posts about people who got a dog and then spent the next several weeks on an emotional rollercoaster because of how emotionally taxing it is. There are so many other things you can do in the meantime until either your family does fully support you, or you live on your own and their feelings about it don't matter.\n\nUltimately, it is your decision, but if you do decide to go forward with getting a dog, make sure you sit down with them and have a long conversation about the fact that there will be mess ups and accidents and explain that you will need their patience as you work through it. Be proactive about thanking them for their understanding, and be understanding if they lose their tempers because you are the one bringing the dog into their home.","score":"3","subreddit":"dogs"}

{"body":"I'm going to comment on the breeds you listed in your post and then suggest a few that might work better for you.\n\nA heeler really isn't for you, as you have come to realize. They are intense dogs that often don't like strangers and have high exercise/stimulation needs. \n\nHuskies *definitely* aren't for you. Unless you have a decade of dog experience and tons of free time, no husky is going to perform cute tricks or walk off-leash with you. That's just not how they work. They also aren't great guard dogs -- a husky would probably let a burglar inside your house because it's interesting and fun. They also need 2-3 hours of high-intensity exercise every day, so if heeler-level exercise scares you then huskies should be off the table.\n\nGreat Danes slobber, a lot. They are cuddly but some of them have no idea how big they are, so you end up on the couch with a 180 lb dog on your lap. They are trainable but most aren't motivated enough to learn the cute tricks you want to teach. I'm not sure about off-leash ability so hopefully someone else chimes in on that.\n\nSince you're planning to rent in the future, I would cross GSDs off your list for now. They could be a good breed for you in the distant future but finding an apartment is hard enough without navigating the joys of breed restrictions. \n\nA boxer is actually a pretty good fit for you! They're highly food-motivated dogs, which makes trick training enjoyable for them, and they are definitely the type to go crazy when you get home. Also look into labs for similar reasons.\n\nA Berner could do very well for you, however you should be aware that they have tragically short lifespans -- only 6-8 years on average. If you can come to terms with that, a Berner wouldn't be a bad match for you. Newfies live slightly longer and are generally hardier than Berners, but they drool like fountains!

{"body":"So good news and bad news. The bad news, this sounds like instinctual herding behaviors but the good news is because it's just nipping right now and now full on herding you may be able to train a lot of it out.\n\n[As an aside, many herding breeds have an agressive play style that does originate from their herding drives but it is your responsibility as the owner to make sure you never allow your dog to make other dogs and other dog parents feel uncomfortable and if that means you and your dog have to leave early or leave after an incident you must do it. The dog will not learn if you allow him time and again to go to the dog park and nip and play with other dogs he will think it's a free for all.]\n\nFor many herding breeds I think the best form of play is meetups of similar breeds, whether it's a breed specific meetup or there is a cool BC or Aussie at your doggie day care your dog likes, ask the owners to set up play dates. Most are HAPPY to have their dogs friends over to play and the dogs will match each other in energy and temperament. Dog parks can be a fickle place for fun and the mix of dogs can be stressful and over stimulating for many dogs.  \n\nNow my personal experiences with this: it should be noted I have an Aussie from working stock who has an extremely strong natural herding drive and he is not, for now, a dog park dog. He doesn't know how to turn off that part of his brain telling him it's play time vs work time and he will herd all the dogs endlessly at the dog park (I'm talking full on separation by size and type, nipping at the butts and ankles, barking in their faces, zooming around the group at full speed). This is something we have been working on him with over the past 2 years so I have a good handle on this (and my family had a GSD and BC growing up so no stranger to the herding dogs)My Aussie used to herd at doggie day care and nip other dogs, he doesn't anymore, he used to nip our ankles and doesn't anymore. So it's a controllable behavior in some environments.\n\n The biggest thing is cementing solid recall and teaching your dog a calming command. When you have a herding breed they have a very agressive play style, and in uncontrolled environments like a dog park this can trigger more of the herding over the playing. There are a lot of posts on here about the pros and cons of dog parks and you should give them a read because they aren't always the best place to take a dog for a variety of reasons. \n\nIf your dog has solid recall any time you see him engaging in a herding behavior such as nipping you call him back. Then you make him engage in the self regulating or calming activity ours is a full lay down where his hip is completely rotated (ask your dog to lay down and wait a minute and you'll see the difference in posture from when you first asked them to when they are actually calm). Then after that he can go back out and play. Rinse and repeat. This is how we got him to stop herding and nipping at doggie day care and after a few months it has worked brilliantly he is going and making friends and playing. But the dog park he still has issues in, mainly small dogs are his targets now. \n\nSecond, any good trainer who has experience with herding tendencies will tell you two things: 1) the behavior can't always be trained 100% out since this is what they were bred for 2) agility will help. And it's soooo true. If you aren't in an agility class even a fun one not a competition level one, get it one asap. The drive it takes a dog to learn the agility moves is the same drive they use when herding so it really helps release some of that energy and that desire to nip and herd. I highly reccomend a weekly or biweekly class if you can find one. \n\nIf you don't clicker train your dog you should start, this will help you immensely with the recall and the calming exercises. The main thing is going slow. Don't train him for a week and throw him back into the ring. Take him to the dog park on off hours where no one is there or maybe one dog is there..work on some of these things and then if more dogs come and he acts up you go home. Try again in a few days. Remember with training you always want to set the dog up for success not failure so since you as the human control the conditions of learning you have to be the one to put an end to, and know when you need to leave that environment for the day. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know. \n\n","score":"5","subreddit":"dogs"}

{"body":"Herding breeds need a ton of exercise and your pooch is a herder and right in the middle of adolescence when their behavioral issues are heightened. \n\nI'm a touch hard pressed to automatically assume it's separation anxiety because all herding reeds become EXTREMELY destructive when they are bored. The dog may not be getting enough mental and physical stimulation. Our Aussie went through a 6 month phase where he ate the floorbpards, couch, some drywall...it was a mess. But he wasn't being exercised properly and it took us a while to figure out how much he needed (aka a fuck ton) and he was also in that adolescent phase where he was just a brat and only did it when we weren't there. \n\nI would start upping the exercise, maybe think about getting into an agility class, buy a flirt pole, more puzzle toys and spend at least an hour before work either taking the dog on a really intensive walk or doing some training sessions and using the flirt pole. You want the dog to be exhausted when you leave. Do this for a week or so and see how the destructive behavior is. If even after upping the exercise your having issues you should speak to a veterinary behaviorist about separation anxiety and how to combat it. \n\nIt honestly imo as a fellow former destructive dog owner and herding breed owner sounds like your dog is in that terrible twos phase and needs more exercise. \n\nEdit: also exercise for herding breeds is not just walks and letting them outside to \"play\" that does nothing for them. They need tasks, jobs, games and activities like children almost. So don't count the times you just let her outside to do her own thing as exercise only structured activities where the dog is active and thinking or problem solving will work. For most dogs a walk and some fetch is enough. For a herding breed a walk and a little fetch isn't nearly enough. They need to be challenged and stimulated so start looking into games and tricks you can do with your dog to occupy them (flyball, agility, flirt pole, sniffing, pond diving, soccer, etc) they are smart and teaching them rules and how to play within them will be way more beneficial than just letting her out to roam around.

What I meant was these interactions are going to be much stronger than any gravitational interactions except for some theoretical very very high energy limit. \n\n  \u0026gt;I can't think of any observable phenomena caused by photon gravitatational interaction other than a plot device in a Frederik Pohl novel though.\n\nWhile not exactly photons, extremely strong magnetic fields in neutron stars might have gravitational effect due the sheer amount  of energy stored in them. They are among some speculative sources of gravitational waves from neutron stars. \n\nhttp://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/398/4/1869\n\nI'm curious to know which novel you are talking about here.

Thats not a bad night in for a student if you throw a few beers in and have a PlayStation hooked up as alternate entertainment when you get knocked out.  But I never really bothered taking poker seriously back then, I was too poor to gamble.  \n\nI've recently started playing semi seriously and either I'm a winning player or I'm due a serious downswing.

I don't think I play enough tables or for high enough stakes to make such things anything more than a rake.\n\nSo yeah its possible, maybe, but there's a few caveats.  First up, I'd be making more money working a second job at MacDonalds, second I don't need the money, its just a challenge, third I've been lucky as fuck and fourth I'm experienced in related things - I come from a card playing family and while my game has mostly not been poker I've logged probably a full year in real time playing cards.

It will for sure be more personal and therefore less stressful to start.\n\nThere isn't a better or more supportive community in combat sports.  You may lack confidence now, but I can assure you are not the only person to turn to BJJ for extreme weight loss.  The stories are countless, you'll likely meet someone who is or was in a similar situation your first day, so don't let anything hold you back.\n\nWhat can you expect?  The hardest thing you'll ever do in your life, but also the most rewarding.  You'll start slow, the nice thing about BJJ is you can take rests in dominant positions until you build up your cardio, unlike the constant push of striking.  Also for self defense, BJJ is the most practical martial art you can know.\n\nI'm not taking anything away from striking martial arts, but I've seen BJJ work for people in similar situations as yourself.  IMO, striking should come later after you reach your weight goals.  After all, movement is arguably the most important part of striking, whereas leverage/technique is the key to BJJ.  \n\nGive it a try, you'll either get the bug or you wont.  If you're more interested in striking, than try that first.  Either way, you will for sure get a great and rewarding workout.

{"body":"Having watched the fight back just now, this is my breakdown of the scoring of the rounds:\n\n #1: McGregor fairly dominant for the entirety of the round. Definitely not a 10-8 like McGregor suggested, even though he dropped Nate once in this round, but comfortably a 10-9 McGregor.\n\n #2: On first viewing it's easy to give this one to Nate, as he seems to finish every round stronger than McGregor, but based on the round as a whole, McGregor dominated the first 2.5 minutes in similar fashion to the first, where he dropped Nate twice, he noticably slowed over the next minute where the exchanges were fairly even, then Diaz dominate the last minute or so. Nate came into the fight in this round, but still a 10-9 McGregor - especially considering the two knockdowns he scored earlier in the round.\n\n #3: Within the first 30 seconds to 1 minute of this round, I thought it was all over, I thought Conor was done. But he held in there and survived some of Nates big shots and circled out of trouble. One judge gave this as a 10-8 to Nate, which I can see how some might go for that given it was a dominant round for Nate, but given how the fight as a whole had gone so far, Nate being dropped 3 times, I think 10-8 for Nate would be unwarranted here, but very strong round. Gave it 10-9 Nate.\n\n Round #4: Cagey round, luckily for Conor, Nate emptied the tank a bit in the last round trying to finish Conor and the pace dropped noticably in this round. It was back and forth, but Conor definitely landed the bigger shots and did more damage. Also of note is Conor stuffing 3 takedown attempts. 10-9 McGregor.\n\n Round #5: Again pretty cagey round, Nate probably shading it up until the last minute, where Nate began to dominate a bit, cemented the round with the final takedown. 10-9 Nate.\n\nTotal score:\n\nMcGregor 48 - 47 Diaz ... The same as two of the three judges, the only difference being one judge gave round 3 as a 10-8 to Nate.","score":"33","subreddit":"MMA"}

{"body":"Thompson leans way too heavy on his front leg, especially in such a wide stance. It just sits out there in front of his opponents, like a fucking piece of meat. If you got someone who is really good at leg kicks (like Woodley), Thompson would have to start changing stances more regularly. Battering up Thompson's leg is the first key to victory. It will significantly hinder his movement, and take some sting out of his kicks. \n\nI love Rory (not so much Hendricks...), but how he (they) expected to take Thompson down when he's at full movement capacity is just beyond moronic. Wear down his legs, then cut him off and shoot in. A fighter who is really good at wrestling (again, like Woodley) would be able to explode into a double and get Thompson to the ground. But, only AFTER Thompson's movement is hindered. \n\nAlso, learn from Jon Jones in the Gustaffson fight. Every time Gus tried to circle away from the cage, to the left or right, Jones would time Gus and land a spinning back kick while Gus attempted to circle that direction. \n\nThompson circles off the cage in the same way, so learn how to time that kick (or, right/left hook) during Thompson's escape period.\n\nThere's your blueprint to beat Thompson. ","score":"1","subreddit":"MMA"}
{"body":"You just don't do heel hooks in gi tournaments. Some say that the gi pants mean you can't slip out easily enough, making it too dangerous. Also, because BJJ is derived from Judo it is influenced by their rules. Whatever the reason, it's just how it goes in gi.\n\nOn the question of belts, I think it's odd to use the gi BJJ belt system for no-gi. They might give belts at your school for people who train no-gi exclusively, but that's not standard practice by any means. The belts come from the Japanese martial arts tradition, which the Gracies inherited from Judo through Mitsuyo Maeda. Why have it for no-gi grappling, which is a different sport with different rules? In fact, if you don't train gi BJJ (and thus don't have a belt rank) many no-gi tournaments will enter you into a division based on how long you've trained. This means that you can have Sambists, Judokas, Catch Wrestlers and Jiu-Jitsukas all facing off against each other. In gi BJJ, where tournaments are divided into belt categories, it is not open to martial artists from different disciplines in the same way. No-gi is less 'traditional', which is probably not a bad thing from the perspective of technical progression. The belt system is from gi BJJ and maybe it should stay there.","score":"-6","subreddit":"MMA"}

Il m'a expliqué qu'il existait des psychiatre qui étaient dans le \"système\" et donc faisaient en sorte de vous dégouter de la transition, quitte à vous rendre dépressif, en refusant de prescrire les hormones, ou pire, en mettant les personnes tenaces sous suppresseurs d'hormones pendant des mois, sachant que sans hormones, on souffre d'effets secondaires graves dont la dépression, ce qui faisait que des trans abandonnaient la transition. Dans le cas de ma connaissance, il avait réussi à se faire suivre par une psychiatre en dehors de ce système de connards qui se pensent savoir tout mieux que les autres, et qui au final traitent les personnes trans comme des merdes.

{"body":"The shittiest car I've ever driven was a 1971 VW Type 3 that had been left outside sitting for a while, bought cheap, and turned into a cheap racecar. By the time I got my hands on it, it had been in one collision on track (not a minor one, but not a major one, either). The transmission case, which came from a Type 1, was cracked and patched back together. That was probably the best component on the car. The motor was from a Type 2, and had 250,000 miles on it before it started racing. We did rebuild the heads at one point, but that didn't help very much. Its oil pressure rarely made it above 20 psi, and would be flat at 0 in turns. Being an air-cooled VW, it still ran like that, but that's a symptom of how poor a condition the motor was in.\n\nThe chassis itself was terrible, as well. It was badly rusted. When we'd jack up the car, we'd end up with piles of rust that looked like anthills under points on the car. Without the (new) roll cage, the car wouldn't have had any structural integrity to speak of. The floor needed reinforcing for the driver's seat to be stable enough to survive a crash. The clutch pedal literally snapped (while I was driving, and I'm not strong). You can imagine the laundry list of other issues the car had - I can't remember most of them.\n\nWhat probably frustrated me the most about this car, though, was its inability to be driven with any sort of reasonable cornering speed. It was rear-engined, rear-wheel-drive, as one would expect of a VW of that age. To get a rear-engined car around the track most effectively, certain techniques are needed which involve sliding the car, often while the drivetrain is under load (either slowing at high RPM or accelerating). The combination of crappy old suspension geometry and hubs not meant for this means the hub splines would strip if one tried to take a corner at speed. It had to slow to about 80% of its grip for the turns, instead of using 100% of it. With a chassis in that bad of shape, 100% of grip wasn't fast. That 80% of grip was nearly parked. And with a Type 2 motor that originally had 48 horsepower... but had lost most of that, it didn't exactly make up for the low cornering speed with acceleration.\n\nIt's the only car I've ever been happy to see crushed.\n\n[This is it, in its \"Bunny\" racing colors, coming in from a test session on track as its older, wiser, faster, better cousin heads out](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13627017_10155170183269152_3413631676442403238_n.jpg?oh=21374bbfb2233a1e799c50c326f22ae5\u0026amp;oe=58560451).","score":"32","subreddit":"cars"}

{"body":"Well, your coworker may be wasting money but leasing a BMW is usually one of the better ways to actually own it since BMW throws in all the maintenance with the vehicle while it's under lease and it's also under warranty during this time.  They also aggressively subsidize the leases by giving pumped up residuals and low money factors so it's often cheaper to lease a BMW instead of buying it and then reselling it when you're done with it.  Even if you do keep it for a longer period of time the maintenance costs are VERY high-actually [the HIGHEST of any brand](https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/the-most-and-least-expensive-cars-to-maintain-by-maddy-martin) so you're still likely to end up spending more than you would have per year on a lease.\n\nIf your coworker can't afford the lease he also couldn't afford to buy a BMW so the fact that he can't afford it doesn't really have to do with him choosing the lease, if anything it's preventing him from being unable to afford to properly maintain the thing and completely trashing a BMW.\n\nI don't usually lease but there's sometimes very good deals where it can be cheaper than buying the same car.  There've been some pretty crazy deals over the last year where you'd clearly be better off leasing than buying.  \nLike this deal: http://leasehackr.com/blog/2016/3/27/californians-lease-a-ford-focus-electric-for-free\nThis one: http://leasehackr.com/blog/2016/4/22/californians-lease-a-chevy-spark-ev-for-free\nThis one: http://leasehackr.com/blog/epic-leftovers-chevy-malibu-58-month\nAnd this one that I almost went for just because it was so cheap: http://leasehackr.com/blog/2015/11/25/epic-leftovers-part-2-lease-the-chevy-cruze-for-37month-0-down\n\nAt the end of the day whether something is a good deal comes down to the numbers, not whether or not it's a lease or buying.  I'm not sure why so many people think it as being buying=good and leasing=bad when you can get horribly ripped off buying and score a really great lease deal.  I think some financial \"guru\" types like to spout easily repeatable and simple to understand stuff but it's not really true.  \n\nThe BMW 5 series is actually being heavily subsidized right now by high residuals so it's a MUCH better decision to lease that than to buy it.","score":"1","subreddit":"cars"}

By saying \"Lego bricks\", you are saying \"bricks made by Lego\", thus acknowledging that \"Lego\" is a brand name, and not the actual name of the bricks themselves. If you're saying \"Legos\", you're using the word as a generic term equivalent to \"stackable plastic bricks\". The danger (for Lego, at least) is that at some point, the word \"Lego\" will become so accepted as a generic term instead of a brand name, that it will not be capable of being protected by law anymore, enabling anyone to use the word as they see fit. An example where this has happened is the word \"Jeep\". It is a trademark belonging to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, but, at least in Europe, has been so widely used for cars from any producer that it has become a generic trademark.

{"body":"I'm not a childcare expert, so I can't really comment on ways to motivate children to be more organized or more obedient, but as far as general Lego cleanliness advice goes, here are some different approaches.\n\n1.) Designate a space that is The Lego Corner. Kids can leave that corner a mess, but they can't let the mess spread beyond that corner. The only time Legos should ever leave that area is when the kids bring you something cool they built to show it off. Afterwards, they should immediately return it to that corner, unless it's *really* cool and they want to display it in the family room or something.\n\n2.) Acquire lots of storage bins. Allow the kids to control the organization scheme of these bins. I know as a child, I was often reluctant to clean up Legos because I'd sorted out a bunch of good pieces and if I dumped them in the box I wouldn't be able to easily find them again. Get big ones for mass storage, and also small ones for temporary storage of pieces sorted out to be used in an ongoing project. The more bins you give them access to, the less they will need to spread legos across the floor.\n\n3.) Have wider, flatter bins rather than taller ones. A bin like [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xblDe29VL._SX522_.jpg) is far better than one like [this](http://www.electionequipment.asia/wp-content/gallery/storage-boxes/Storage_Box_001.jpg) because small pieces naturally sift to the bottom, so with less vertical space, fewer bricks need to be moved out of the way to find the smaller pieces. The kids will just make less of a mess since they're keeping more parts in the bin, rather than moving them out of the way to get to other pieces. Get used to the scrapey sound of someone pawing through the lego bin to find a certain piece.\n\n4.) If the kids are building on a rug, there's really nothing you can do but pick them up one at a time and drop them in the bucket. It's tedious, but otherwise you'll miss the really small pieces and they'll get lost. Have the kids build on either a table with a raised edge, or a smooth floor. That way, it's *far* easier to clean up afterwards, as you can just sweep them up. Maybe even invest a kid sized broom for exactly this purpose.","score":"4","subreddit":"lego"}

I seek God!\" -- As many of those who did not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. Has he got lost? asked one. Did he lose his way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated? -- Thus they yelled and laughed.\n\nThe madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. \"Whither is God?\" he cried; \"I will tell you. We have killed him -- you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.\n\n\"How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us -- for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.\"\n\nHere the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern on the ground, and it broke into pieces and went out. \"I have come too early,\" he said then; \"my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men.

Only you can answer that question for yourself, but you need to think it through very clearly and rather deliberately based on strong amounts of self-honesty. In the interest of being accurate this is going to be a very long answer. So if you want, it might be best for you to stop right here. I won't be offended if you don't read my whole reply.\n\n--\n\nThis sometimes is where I feel Buddhist style meditation comes in. It fosters a follow-up of true contemplation and honest self-assessment. \n\nAs far as trying to decipher the amount of raw and unfettered habit that goes into online computer gaming vs. a developed and well-balanced *(and disciplined) marshaling* of your action/technique, is wholly dependent on how it's approached by you -- the person doing the act itself. No one can really say or tell you what is right or not right. It's something you must decide for yourself.   \n\nLet me put it another way *(I'm no gamer so..)* there are instances where the hand-eye-coordination that goes into video gaming is about very well practiced *balance* and it's beneficial. *BUT*, that's for the individual to ferret out for himself. Not for me to tell you. \n\nI'm a big fan of sport/fitness bicycling *(been so for years and years).* I've bicycled quite a lot -- alone, and also in good and pleasant company -- across many thousands of miles of open road -- mostly for sport, pure exercise, and as a form of often inward looking meditation, especially when facing a long ride mostly alone of thousands of miles; just me, the bike, and the road itself. I've at times gone thousands of miles *cross-country* packed to the gunnels with camping gear, food, clothing, etc. all quite alone gaining infinite positive inner-looking perspective doing it. Usually.. *(I can't think of one time when it hasn't happened)* I wind up meeting people along the way *(a few hundreds of miles out).* And, when I'm feeling inwardly ready *(for whatever reasons)* I will join up with a group, casually, for mutual rewards and any of the benefits which are to be had. Often it's just plain old good company and fun. But riding all alone can be another kind of fun too. It's really about the journey, as they say. \n\nWhen I derive positive side-effects from bike riding *(like clearer more relaxed thinking, or loss of unpleasant imposed anxiety which life can bring, better health, fitness, etc., etc.)* ..with the right amounts of practice, it's a very-very balanced and a good thing -- even if it still borders on being an obsession of sorts; it brings multiple health and mental benefits. It's *a habitual* regular activity that I can manage to do in a very *balanced* manner for my betterment and for the basic good. It's, simply said, good for me to do it -- under those specific and very positive, well-practiced, circumstances. However, on the other side of the same coin, if I do it habitually for the sheer obsession of just doing it, it's no longer balanced *(at least for me anyway).* The fun is there, but also fading fast; it becomes more like work than fun.  And I have to put it aside until I can come back to it for the greater and better overall affect; not a negative habitual *need* to do it as an obsessive partial *addiction.* \n\nAgain here is where balance comes in; \"the middle way.\" \n\nI think it's the same with anything a person can want to do, in fact I know it; even so with video games, or even with the practice of Buddhism. There is *always* a tipping point where what is good and well-balanced becomes sorely unbalanced and no longer good for you; it's then just a mere habit. \n\nNo one can delineate this for you; it's really your call only, not mine. It's a highly personal thing. \n\nRight now I'm in a temporary hold where I've had to knock off my bicycling for a while, because I was just doing it *(most recently anyway)* for obsessive reasons and not practical or balanced good ones; even though I was still deriving some amounts health benefits and joy from it. \n\nAt the back of my mind there was a general very subtle *call-out to stop* doing it at least temporarily, until I could get back to it for all the right reasons; well balanced beneficial ones -- something I clearly did before now. It's matter of me deciding for my own good what is right action, and what is not right action. The benefits of well practiced repetitious action, or a not so balanced habit; it's really balance vs. a repeated-obsession of pure habit alone. It is highly personal though!\n\nAs for gaming it can be a very good thing and it can be a very bad thing, most of that really depends on you, and how you ultimately go about doing it, and regarding whatever you garner personally from doing it that much. \n\nI hope that makes some sense to you; it's the best I can do, coming at your question from my own perspective; while trying to place myself in your shoes in the best way I can. \n\nGood can be bad, and bad can be good; depending on your motives *(right intention)* and on the practical applications *(right action).* ..Less is often more, and more can be less; although sometimes less is just less, and more is just too much. I think it was Dr. Sigmund Freud who said \"*sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.*\" :)\n\nIt's a personal thing really. You have to ask yourself if your \"habit\" is doing you good, or if it's ultimately bad for you to continue. ..No easy task; it takes lots of self directed honesty and proper discipline *(which is something else which often comes and goes, depending on your \"balance\").* Good luck, hope you find the right answer. Something tells me if you're asking the question itself, the right answer will come along for you. Often its right there at you finger tips, as the saying goes.  :)   ","score":"1","subreddit":"Buddhism"}

{"body":"Yes, there are reports of women calling a clinic for help but the nearest clinic is now too far away from them, because many others have closed. They ask the clinic staff to listen to the ingredients in their house, such as cleaning supplies, and ask what they can ingest to end the pregnancy. Women are also forced to wait longer to have abortions and in some cases, they are pushed past the legal cutoff in Texas. But yay, the number of reported abortions is down! /s\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Waiting longer for an abortion increases the likelihood of complications. In their brief for the clinics’ side, a group of doctors and gynecologists write, “The mortality rate for abortions occurring prior to 13 weeks of gestation, the period during which most abortions are performed, is no more than 0.4 per 100,000. The mortality rate increases significantly, however, throughout the second trimester.” Studies have shown that the number of second-trimester abortions have risen in Texas since the law went into effect.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy, widely considered to be the crucial deciding vote in the case, said during the arguments, “This law has increased the number of surgical procedures as opposed to medical procedures, and this may not be medically wise.”\n\nAnd\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;If clinics become more sparse, some women will likely attempt to induce their own abortions. According to a pair of studies recently released by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas, between 100,000 and 240,000 Texas women between the ages of 18 and 49 have already tried to end a pregnancy by themselves.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;“We've had women who called us and said, ‘Can you tell us how to do my own abortion with medication in my cabinet or cleaning supplies I have under my sink?’” Hagstrom Miller said. \n\n[Source](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/03/what-happens-when-the-clinics-close/471969/)","score":"7","subreddit":"texas"}

Should we not compliment people? Should we discourage compliments? Should we create an air of fear around compliments? Are compliments something that people should grow to be wary of? The answer to all of the above is no. \n\nWe should compliment others when we see something to compliment, we should encourage others to say good things about each other, compliments are intended to be *nice things* and should be taken as such, and unless there are other concerns present, a compliment is just a compliment.\n\nLong story short, people down vote for their own reasons, often their reasoning is flawed or driven by an illogical emotional response and they should just grow up!

I am working on developing an independent comic right now, and hopefully it will be out in time for me to apply to DC next year.  \n  \nThat said, I know how you feel.  \n  \nI've also been applying for TV Writing Workshops. This year, I've applied to Nickelodeon and WB. I submitted my application and spec script for Nickelodeon back in February, and had to wait until the end of July to find out if I made it into even the semi-finals of the program. As the months went on and no word came, I got more and more nervous and upset. And then June ended and I was more nervous and July came and went and nothing came in the mail from Nick. I wrote (what I felt was) [a really solid Venture Bros. spec script that I was very proud of,](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2p2ozy06h6fvxxc/The%20Venture%20Bros.-%20Crisis%20in%20Middle-Life.pdf?dl=0) and didn't get in, and it bummed me out.

I planned my life around the possibility of getting in, knowing full well that I probably wasn't going to. And now I'm here, jobless, living on savings, trying to get anything going. Over the past year, I've spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours working on developing creative projects and trying to get my career as a writer started, and the only real progress is a as-of-yet unreleased series of videos for Marvel's YouTube channel for which I am making less than minimum wage.  \n  \nBut you know what? That's okay. It's okay that[ the cartoon I was trying to develop](http://megatongirl.tumblr.com) had to go back to square one after half a year and thousands of dollars. It's okay that the comic's been going a little slower than I'd like it to be. It's okay that I signed a lease and have started paying for a car and been buying furniture for a life that was planned around getting into a program I didn't get into.

{"body":"Hey there! Let me attempt to introduce you to the wonderful world of Wally West - he's an awesome character, I'm sure you'll definitely love him if you love Spider-Man!\n\n- The best introduction to Wally is through Mark Waid's Flash series. His origin story is told in The Flash issues #62-66, collected as the classic story arc 'Born to Run.' Waid then went on to write tons of the definitive stories for Wally, and it's a lot of people's favourite runs with the character. Unfortunately there is no trade of the whole run available right now, but [one will be coming out in December.](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Mark-Waid-Book-One/dp/1401267351) \n\n- [The Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar](http://www.bookdepository.com/Flash-Mark-Millar-Grant-Morrison/9781401261023) is an absolutely bonkers and loved by fans for being ridiculously creative and nuts. Definitely recommended if you want some off-the-wall adventures!\n\n- [The Flash by Geoff Johns Book One](http://www.bookdepository.com/Flash-Book-1-Scott-Kolins-Geoff-Johns/9781401258733) and [Two](http://www.bookdepository.com/Flash-Book-2-Scott-Kolins-Geoff-Johns/9781401261016?ref=bd_recs_1). Another awesome Wally West run featuring some great adventures, a look at where Wally fits in the Flash legacy, and an exploration of his relationship with his villains. It's awesome. Book 3 will be out at some point too!\n\nAs far as modern Wally goes - essentially, there was a world-changing event known as Flashpoint which relaunched the DC universe completely, making the \"New 52\" universe. In the New 52, the Wally West of the old continuity was replaced with a different reimagining of the character who was also called Wally West, but fans didn't like this new version of Wally (New 52 Wally was kind of a weird racist stereotype). \n\nSo now, DC has started an event called \"DC Rebirth\" in which the original Wally West that everyone loves has returned and is trying to solve the mystery of how he was erased from time and how 10 years were stolen from the DC characters by some overarching evil (it's essentially a big metaphor for how the New 52 was badly received for resetting all the character development that had happened over the publisher's history). \n\nRight now, the comic featuring Wally is Titans. This is essentially a comic focusing on the now-grown-up members of the Teen Titans group that Wally was once a part of back in the day. He's basically arrived to reunite with them, rekindle their friendships, and the team is joining him on his adventure to restore everyone's memories and find out who reset time. It's been absolutely awesome and full of love so far! If you'd like to read it, the reading order goes:\n\nDC Universe Rebirth #1 one-shot (itself a good introduction to Wally, because it recaps his life story whilst bringing him back) -\u0026gt; Titans: Rebirth #1 one-shot -\u0026gt; Titans #1 -\u0026gt; new issue out monthly.\n\nIt'll be collected as a paperback in January. \n\n---\n\nPhew, okay, that's Wally West! Alternatively, if you want to get a feel for his character outside of the comic books, loads of fans know and love him from the original [Justice League and Justice League Unlimited cartoons](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275137/), and the freaking incredible cartoon series [Young Justice](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641384/).

{"body":"\u0026gt;THE CITY DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT HAS AN IDENTITY\n\nOne of the troubles that Vancouver has is that it keeps getting pulled every direction so it can't focus on anything. Love it or hate it the Olympics and Expo were two great projects that gave the city a focus. It determined where to spend money, what sort of infrastructure upgrades we need and some idea of what things will look like in 10 years. \n\n\nVancouver at the moment has no focus and is largely powerless to stop the root problems that the city is facing in terms of housing.\n\nIt's largely powerless, not because politicians are bought and paid for, or that there isn't legally anything they can do, it's more that anytime you do anything in the city, there is a such an outrage that they immediately have to backtrack and spend more time in consultation that is a very vocal tiny minority of people. \n\nPerfect example- The Arbutus Corridor- The City made a decisive action to buy the land, and remove the rails. City engineers (people who are paid to make city building decisions) decide to install a paved path along it to draw people into the space during consultation for a permanent design. Not five days after they start paving a group pops up and says \"HOW DARE YOU NOT CONSULT\"  and the city backtracks on the plan. \n\nRegional example- the mayors have a plan for transit in the region. Something that almost everyone in the region needs in one format or the other- their hands are tied by a provinicial government and we run into a Translink tax and we know how that went.\n\nDecisions like this used to be decided by professionals who are paid to make the right decisions, empowered by the elected officials that they work for. That's not happening anymore because people are sticking their noses into things that traditionally they never did. \n\nA highway like the Sea to Sky would have never been built if it was new in 2000 if it was up to the people today, yet the vast majority of people think it's a good idea that it was upgraded.\n\n What about the grandview cut for rail traffic- if it was up to people today it never would have happened and we would still have marshland to Clark drive today. \n\nWe don't have an identity because we don't let our leaders do anything and when we do, we usually vote them out for doing a good job. Say what you will about Gordon Campbell, and Glen Clark for that matter- they steered the Olympic ship to make sure it wasn't a stupid amount of money. (comparatively-speaking). Yet, all we remember about Clark is that he built a deck and ruined the bc economy, and Campbell got drunk in hawaii and tried to institute a tax that is actually better the vast majority of people in this province. \n\nSo yeah, we don't have an identity and it shows. \n\n\n","score":"15","subreddit":"vancouver"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; Davies recently told Fairfax Media he did not want a seat on the board. Stressing the push was not a personal attack on the board, insisting there were \"very good people\" in power, he expressed concern about a lack of diversity. Davies noted the board included five lawyers and two accountants, while also stressing that four directors had sat for for more than a decade.\n\n\nSo their concerns are a) the decision to appoint Hardwick was wrong, b) there are too many lawyers and accountants and not enough botanists on the board and, c) some members have held their positions for 10+ years.\n\n\nPersonally I think the board has done a good job. They reduced debt quicker than planned, have posted profits for the last few years, have record members and have consistently had some of the highest average attendances per home game, the development of punt road is fantastic, and IMO Hardwick has been incredibly successful, in taking an average list to three finals. Richmond are simply playing to their lists level this year, they over-achieved in 2013-2015.\n\n\nHardwick is the right person as coach. The club needs a review of every assistant and development coach from the top down to VFL level. They need to throw some coin around to try and recruit the best strategists and mentors for the kids and build a solid game plan around their strengths. \n","score":"25","subreddit":"AFL"}

{"body":"I think simple meals that are well executed can be just as, if not more, impressive as super complicated ones. Try to do homemade as much as possible and it will up all your things to another level. Like baking your own bread, or making tortillas for taco night. Try making hand rolled pasta and roast tomatoes for a homemade sauce. I think making things from scratch makes foods more enjoyable because you can see all the hard work that goes into it.\n\nI tend to aim for comfort foods so I'm going to go with a roasted butternut squash risotto. It's pretty simple but you've got to put time and effort into it.\n\nTime for this is hard to put into exact numbers so you've just gotta enjoy yourself while cooking and not be too impatient.\n\nFirst, you roast your squash. Cut it in half, scoop out the seeds and rub a bit of olive oil on it. Stick it in the oven at 400F for 20-30 minutes depending on the size of the squash.\n\nGet some of your favourite vegan white wine. Pour yourself a glass and fry up some onions in more olive oil. \n\nThen add arborio rice (like, 2 cups? I usually make a lot of this because I love it) and toast it, then pour in a few glugs of wine. \n\nWhile this is happening you're also warming some vegetable stock in another pot (don't boil it, just keep it hot). Add some stock a cup or so at a time and stir it pretty vigorously until it's absorbed. \n\nWhen you find a spare moment (maybe add a little extra stock and take a few minutes), blend up your roasted squash with some stock, nooch, garlic, salt and pepper (maybe a pinch of cayenne if you're feeling it).\n\nKeep adding stock until the rice is getting tender. Stir it super quickly at this point because you want to get all the starch out (that's how it gets creamy!). \n\nNow fry some sage leaves in olive oil until they're crispy but not burnt. Save the oil and the leaves for the end. \n\nWhen the rice is nearly cooked, add the butternut squash mixture. And lastly, chop up the fried sage and mix it in with the oil.\n\nNow let it sit. This is important! Like 10 minutes at least so all the flavours meld togehter.\n\nI like eating it with some marinated and roasted portobello caps or a green salad. Or, you know, just a giant bowl on its own too.","score":"3","subreddit":"vegan"}

Things like FPTP, the domination of politics by two main parties, the failure to have a proper debate in the referendum. All comes from a failure to educate people about how democracy in this country works and the difference between representative democracy and direct democracy that people don't understand and don't question. \n\n2. Government influence on the Courts - Better division between the Courts and the political state (basically we need a basic constitution that gives us very basic rights) .Always tricky because we can see what effects a 200 year old constitution can do (USA). But basically the Courts need to be less influenced by governments and more influenced by individual rights this is why I would like to see us expand ECHR to give the constitution it has more strength in the UK.

Multiple attempts at tapping the ball around an on-rushing striker only to get stuffed. Bad passing.  Still overly physical despite being the skinniest guy on the pitch.\n* Santi absolutely bossed the second half.  He had a powerful pile-driver for the best goal of the game and was a level or two above every other offensive player.\n* Theo blew hot and cold.  Overall it was the usual case of making excellent runs only to have a crap touch or bad decision making.  \n* Honorable mentions to Campbell and Iwobi\n* The Viking goalkeeper had an amazing first half and his stock undoubtedly went up after this match.\n* The Vikings substituted 9 players at half time, which is not coincidentally when we started to dominate and look more fluid.

I have had several interactions with police officers in several different communities where I was not the offender. The police asked questions, including wanting to know my date of birth, address, full name, marital status, .... I didn't understand why that was relevant to the situation. In ALL such situations where I asked why that was relevant, the response was an escalation of danger: I was accused of disobeying a police officer, and threatened with arrest if I failed to fully answer the question.\n\nI am an autistic adult. I didn't understand the situation. I was asking a seemingly simple, neutral question to understand the situation, so that I could be helpful. Threatening me with arrest for asking a question was excessive.\n\nYet, it is the standard response for some number of police departments.\n\nOne, one, police officer took the time to explain that it is standard procedure for police officers to ask for the information. As a bystander, which I was, I had no obligation to answer the officers' questions. But, in those situations, that is not what the officers told me. Effectively, the officers lied.\n\nSo, from my experience, it is believable that the police officers in Hays KS jumped to conclusions, and escalated the situation, where they could have de-escalated the situation.\n\nI don't know what training they have, or have not, had.

Do I hold the entire law enforcement community responsible for their actions? Absolutely not. The same applies to citizens. The actions of the few do not represent the actions of the whole.  \n\n\"Punish bad cops\" and \"stop breaking the law\" are not mutually exclusive ideas. I think it's sensible to say \"punish those who abuse their power or commit crimes, and stop those who want to convince society that it's *cops vs the people*\".","score":"2","subreddit":"nyc"}

The losing team played better than the winning team when scoring those 33 points, but the winning team did better overall. \n\nScot's jury vote was the most explained of any of them, with him yelling at Aubry after the Peter boot about how she and Joe were indecisive spazzes and out of the alliance. He told them that he was going to write both of their names down at the next TC and just keep crossing them off until he decided. In the finale when Michele needs to take someone off the jury, Aubry repeatedly pushes for Scot because he's the biggest locked jury vote against her. These are good signs in the edit that Scot's vote is not going to go to Aubry. \n\nAlso though every jury is bitter and the editors did a great job showing why this jury would be bitter at Tai and Aubry and not at Michele by repeatedly showing the losers as wishy washy, indecisive and dishonest, and showing Michele as a social gamer who everyone loved and who had made no enemies.","score":"-5","subreddit":"survivor"}

{"body":"Tower/Tracon. We use the STARS system with Fusion. Most STARS installations just use one radar source, but they're trying to switch to Fusion, which takes as many sources as possible (radar and ADS-B), correlates all the positions, then plots the point of the aircraft using several inputs instead of just one. So we're using our own radar, the air force base's radar (40 miles away) and I think two center radars (100 miles and 200 miles away or something like that) plus ADS-B. So where most normal radar setups, including single-input STARS installations, update the aircraft's position like every 7 seconds (center is longer intervals, like 15 seconds or something), we are updated every second. It's cutting edge 1990's tech, but it's still way better than the old submarine-looking radar scopes we had 3 years ago!","score":"15","subreddit":"aviation"}
