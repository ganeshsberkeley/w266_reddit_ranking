In the meantime nobody is outraged about much bigger threats than terrorism (e.g. the use of fossil fuels, global warming, or even obvious and direct threats such as drunk driving). Nobody is demanding drastic measures to deal with these things.\n\nAll the while, native (especially right wing extremist) crime is heavily underreported. Nobody is scared of right wing extremists although they are currently destaibilizing our nations, threatening our way of life and try to ruin our future while themselves being the most criminal groups of all (right wing extremists committing over half of all ideologically motivated crime in Germany, for example and terrorizing entire cities with mobs destroying property on a regular basis).\n\nYou heard about what the evil immigrants did in Cologne during New Year's right? Groping some women?  \n\nWell, guess what you never heard of: [Mobs of hundreds of right wing extremists terrorizing an entire city](http://www.n-tv.de/politik/OB-spricht-von-offenem-Strassenterror-article16751321.html).    \n\nOrganized criminal right wing groups regularly attacking immigrants and left wingers.\n\nHmm... weird, isn't it? The right wing nutjobs do far worse stuff than refugees all the time yet nobody seems to care. The international press heavily pushed the immigrant sexual harassment crimes... yet ignored the violent organized assault and rioting of hundreds of right wing nationalist extremists. It's almost as if you are wrong...\n\nWhy do you believe people vote for right wing extremist parties or insane psychopathic populists like Donald Trump if they aren't being brainwashed by the media? Because they are informed and reasonable people? lol\n\n\u0026gt;People are pissed because of rape and fucking tax burdens\n\nHahaha\n\nYeah right.\n\nIf people cared about economics and doing what's best for people, they would support far left politics.\n\n\u0026gt;not because of some underlying 'racism' or 'xenophobia'\n\nThat's the only actual reason to vote for right wing politics, though. People dumb enough to buy into right wing extremist propaganda. Hate, ignorance, fear. The right wing position is entirely based on emotions and lies/misrepresentations. Them giving some dumb excuses about \"tax burdens\" or trying to demonize immigrants by pointing at rape statistics won't change that fact. Especially in Germany, increased immigration is not even just an option, it's a necessity. Without increasing immigration to levels even higher than the refugees crisis, Germany's economy will collapse. No exaggeration necessary here. \n\nRight wing extremist voters are dumb and uneducated on average. They are frustrated males scared of the future and due to their ignorance they buy into the simplistic populist garbage of the right. They don't understand that what they are voting for will accomplish the opposite of what they want. They are simply too dumb or too uneducated. It's really that simple. There are no valid reasons to vote for these politics if you care about humanity and the planet.\n\n\nHere, this is the kind of person you are looking at when you look at right wingers:   \nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ps4gamedemon\n\nThis guy just wrote me death threats per private message and is worshipping mass murderers like Breivik. \n\nHe is making terroristic threats and advocates genocide against liberals and Muslims. He is fully aware of how violent and aggressive right wingers are and is looking forward to times when he can murder Muslims. You should read some of the messages he keeps sending me. He isn't the only one, either. These are the real beliefs of right wingers.\n\nThis is the only kind of person who would seriously support shit like UKIP or the AfD or Trump. Everyone else who supports this nonsense is just a brainwashed idiot who doesn't understand the shit s/he votes for.\n\n\u0026gt;when fuckwits like you start carpet bombing the conversation with buzzwords you've already lost\n\nWhat buzzwords?

{"body":"It's worse than that: total paralysis would be in *incredibly good* outcome from this procedure.  Not by Canavero's predictions, but by basically everyone else's.\n\nIn general, severing the spinal cord is lethal over a fairly short period, even with medical care.  Total paralysis usually comes from something less than full severing, because that destroys all kinds of autonomic functions that keep your non-heart organs working right.  So everything from endocrine function to digestive and respiratory functions fall apart with full breakage of the spinal cord.\n\nBeyond that, this is a hugely dangerous surgery in other terms - removing and reattaching a head requires flawlessly reconnecting major blood vessels and a lot of other things that are far from simple.  Necks are *important*, transplant rejection is a huge risk, and there are a ton of unsolved problems that make this surgery look incredibly dangerous aside from neurological issues.\n\nIf this treatment could get people with lethal body ailments 'upgraded' to full paralysis, that would actually be pretty useful.  Among other things, paralysis will probably be treatable way sooner than death.\n\nBut right now, I think the consensus is that \"fully paralyzed\" would be a huge success, and this will almost certainly be a very expensive way to kill the patient.","score":"15","subreddit":"worldnews"}

{"body":"The processor is the librarian that brings books from the shelves to the desk and then reads them.\n\nThe more storage you have, the more books you can have on the shelves. The faster the storage, the closer they are to the desk, and the easier they are for the librarian to access.\n\nThe more memory you have, the bigger desk you have, and therefore the more books the librarian can read simultaneously.\n\nThe faster and better architected processor you have, the more adept that librarian is at retrieving the books from the shelves to the desk, and the faster she can read them and understand the info she read.\n\nAll three are super important components, but core differences in how multitasking works in Android versus iOS set different priorities for each. iOS reserves the ability to continuously run in the background only for certain types of apps. The others get cached to storage when you close them, and have to be reloaded when you open them again. Android allows apps to run in the background for a period of time, and so if you reopen them within that time window they don't reload. They stay in memory.\n\nUnfortunately, Android won't make full use of 6GB of memory unless you're running super heavy apps simultaneously, so it's a bit pointless, but 3GB on the iP7 is also pointless except for image processing. The rest of the time it will have little impact.\n\nIt makes sense for both devices the way they've been upgraded though. Because memory management is the way it is on iOS, and because of how rocking fast the storage already is, the naturally most impactful place to upgrade would be the processor. And because memory has traditionally been a big choking point for Android, it makes sense for OnePlus to stuff the 3 with memory and faster storage.\n\nReally, though, Apple wins on performance because their hardware is designed cohesively as a package and their software is written bespoke to the hardware. In contrast, every Android OEM is forced to piece together their devices from components not designed together, and then either customize Android to their device, or use a near stock version and pray for the best.","score":"42","subreddit":"apple"}

There's definitely things I can suggest for guys to approach women, but it's more in a bar/club scenario. Dating is just sort of a.... well, kettle of fish. After splitting up with my ex, our friendship groups shattered into people not interested in them romantically, and people not interested in me romantically, but we're all good friends. Dating is annoying as fuck, tbh. \n\nReddit is wrong. You may not know that you want to date a girl right away. She may be gorgeous, but she may be dumb as bricks. She may also be a bran muffin, but may be great with talking and hilarious as fuck. Some of the best couples I know aren't super attractive, but they've been together for the longest. \n\nIt's a shame that women are so frequently frightened off from seeking initiative, similarly with men. Men don't want to seem 'creepy' and women think 'oh guys don't like it'. \n\nGirls risk the harsh rejection every time too, and you've said that women who try taking initiative are rejected. It's not exactly that different. I suppose the dating culture is different, but being rejected for taking initiative is commonplace for both genders. Men shouldn't be aggressive, but there's no harm in approaching a girl as long as she's giving the right cues, same with guys. I'd never approach a guy who's mid conversation with his buddies, but guys tend to invade our space and earn an eye-roll. \n\nI'd suggest looking up some tips on body language to be honest! Clothing doth not an available girl make. Also, it really does not hurt to approach a girl's friends beforehand to ask if she's available, as it strikes up conversation and allows her friends to vet you. \n\nSide note: The amount of guys that will disappear when a girl's friend says 'hey I need to speak to you' and the girl tells you to wait is... extraordinary. Most of the time, they're going to go and talk about you, and the pros/cons. The guys that ditch girls who go to the bathroom/bar/with their friends are usually the impatient, tail-chasing ones.

When I used to be a server at a decently upscale restaurant, I worked with this dishwasher (I'll call him Rick), who was in his late 40's, and had clearly had some issues with hard drugs and alcohol in his past. The guy was just a little off. \n\nAs a little backstory, a week before his meltdown one of the female servers accidentally brushed against him in the kitchen which really pissed him off for some reason. He complained to the GM that the server had grabbed his ass, winked at him, and said \"do something about it\" (definitely didn't happen). \n\nOne day about a week later, he shows up to work wasted, and whacked out on pills, with blood all over his face and a busted nose (I can only assume he got his ass kicked at a bar before his shift started). He came in through the front door of the restaurant, and was wandering around the dining room bleeding and ranting about how he was \"Sexually harassed\" by his coworkers and that the restaurant was a \"shit hole with shit managers.\" \n\nWhile the shift manager is running around apologizing and comping peoples' meals, the GM grabs Rick and herds him into the kitchen where he starts yelling at him, and tells him to get the fuck out of the restaurant. Rick predictably refuses to leave, so the GM literally wrestles him out the back door and shuts it. Rick starts trying to open it again and like three people were holding the door shut. \n\nThen he stops trying to open the door, and we all realize he's gonna run around to the front again. We beat him there and lock the door, but he's hammering on the glass and yelling \"I'm gonna kill you all!\"\nPolice are called, and the GM goes outside to try and calm him down, but they end up sort of wrestling around again. To this day, seeing a fancy restaurant's general manager wrestle an insane dishwasher to the ground in front of a dozen customers is by far the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. \n\nRick ended up running away before the police got there, but he still called the restaurant and made vague threats for like a week after.

And that's why you let someone type in their gender on a web form in addition to making the two most common options available at just a click (and then you make sure you're handling the input securely because you're a clever person and don't want someone who puts their gender as \"Attack_Helicopter');DROP TABLE Customers;--\" to screw up your website).","score":"92","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

My now husband and I had been broken up and were just getting back together, things were tumultuous and my health insurance hadn't kicked in yet so I had to go to the only free clinic in town that took pregnant women and that just happened to be clear across town in a very hard to get to location.  On top of this - because I was new at work - I couldn't tell anyone I was pregnant and I couldn't take much time off work and this free clinic was so busy if you were more than THREE MINUTES late you had to reschedule, no exceptions.\n\nWell, I got lost.  Between the panic and the hormones I was a blithering mess, a complete hysterical disaster when this elderly man with a black dog approached me and I asked them for directions.  After explaining my situation to the man he said \"Forget it, you don't have time for this.  I'll just take you there.\"  and he got in his car and led me in my car all the way there.  I got there with about 30 seconds to spare.  They almost denied me but I was so hysterical they let it slide.\n\nThe man left me his phone number so I contacted him several days later and met him for coffee and surprised him with a box of gift certificates and some glass ornaments my husband made for him.  My husband is a glass artist who works for a museum and we were able to get him and his wife museum memberships, a free $200 dinner at the Space Needle, $50 for the gift shop, $100 on uber, and Cody made some cute glass ornaments of his dog.

My mother, always a kind \u0026amp; loving soul, decided after hearing him mention all the laundry he needed to do that she would go to his house and do his laundry for him. \n\nShe let herself in, and discovered enough laundry to completely fill her Isuzu trooper... twice. But, steadfast and determined to help her oldest child, she powered through.\n\nMy brother arrived home from work, tired and absent minded, and made it all the way to the bedroom before noticing that something was amiss. At first he though he had been robbed (his comforter was missing) but he quickly noticed the things missing were his 4' tall piles of dirty clothes. \n\nNow, my brother has... odd tastes. He had, at least at one point in the past, explored a few unusual kinks, and collected some interesting accessories. Accessories which had been unearthed in the process of cleaning out his two SUV-loads of laundry. My mother being in a cleaning mode at the time, did what all mothers do: she tidied and organized. \n\nThus did my brother come home to find all his various floggers and paddles hung carefully from hooks in the closet, and numerous restraints gathered into pairs, nested, and placed in drawers. All his various... toys were arranged and tied, Martha-Stewart-like in discrete places in his home. \n\nNaturally, when he told me the story, I nearly died laughing. He said \"you wouldn't think it was funny if it happened to you\", to which I replied \"yeah, but it **didn't!**\" Because that's how little brothers are. ","score":"217","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"First: Congratulations! My first acceptance is going to be greeted with much personal rejoicing, so enjoy it as hard as you can.\n\nSecond: from another short story writer (most people here seem to be writing fantasy novels), a bit of advice moving forward, especially if you, like me, are looking to break into the professional litmag market. Don't rely on stories you bash out in one afternoon/night. To create work of high quality usually requires somewhere between a couple of redrafts and a bazillion redrafts. Everyone's process is different, but it's safe to say most professionally-published short fiction was in progress from inception to completion, for weeks. And: don't assume from one rejection that a piece isn't good enough. If I read you right, you sent out each story exactly once. In the real world, you can send a story out a dozen times to different magazines. One rejection does not mean, objectively, a story is unpublishable; every editor and magazine has different tastes, and even blind luck is a part of the process. There are stories in *Best American Short Stories* every year whose authors say in the notes in the back that they sent it out north of forty times before it found a place.\n\nOne publication is not the cure for your disease -- but that's good news. Keep writing, and learn to edit and revise, and keep sending out relentlessly. The rejections sting, but you grow a thicker skin eventually, and it's all part of the path toward successful publications in more and better places. But before you push toward that, take a moment to celebrate this moment. I'm sure it's sweet.","score":"49","subreddit":"writing"}

The major reason for this rapid growth is the infusion of $13.3 billion in investment to move 3.3 million units of vehicle capacity from Japan, Germany, and S. Korea to Mexico rather than the movement of U.S. and Canadian capacity.  This report highlights North American vehicle production trends, and demonstrates that while automakers and suppliers are attracted by Mexico’s low labor rates, there are many other factors behind Mexico’s growing role in the North American automotive industry. Combined with lower labor costs, Mexico’s unique free trade position with 40 countries and access to 47 percent of the world’s automotive market provides a significant competitive edge to attract automotive investment that the United States and Canada do not have.  Growth in Mexican production volumes, however, can still result in new business for U.S. and Canadian suppliers. Due to well-integrated North American supply chains, vehicles produced in Mexico may be comprised of up to 40 percent U.S. content. In fact, U.S. exports of parts and components to Mexico more than doubled between 2005 and 2014 to a level of $18.4 billion.\n\n.\n \ntl;dr: \n\n* You only save about $800 in cost per vehicle by producing in Mexico, rather than the U.S.. \n\n* Cheap small cars are almost impossible to produce at a profit, regardless of the manufacturer in question. That $800 can swing a small car from losing money on every unit to a very slight profit. This is largely because U.S. consumers refuse to buy small cars (exception: coastal urban areas).\n\n* You save close to $3,000 by shipping from Mexico to Europe, rather than from the U.S., however, due to all the Free Trade Agreements Mexico has. \n\n* The cost differential of producing in Mexico rather than in Germany or Japan is dramatically larger than the U.S./Mexico reduction, hence all the European and Asian companies setting up shop there.\n\n* Small cars sell pretty well outside the U.S., so you'll want to produce them for global markets, and build them where you have tariff-free access to the destination markets. **Especially** if you're trying to sell in Europe.","score":"19","subreddit":"news"}

But let me just throw this out there . . .\n    \nMy take on this is that you have a picture in your head of the kind of girlfriend you *want* to be, but that's not really what you are.  What I'm seeing is someone who claims to be almost solely about her partner's pleasure, but really is in it for the way picturing herself that way makes her feel about herself and the pleasure *she* gets from that.\n  \nSounds kind of harsh, right?  I don't mean it that way though.  It's *really* common.  And people get there unknowingly and by having the best of intentions.\n   \nThe deal is . . . *you're* keeping all the control here.  YOU please HIM.  Because he's the one getting off, you can think that you're the \"servant\" here, but really he gets off when and how you approve.  Reddit is riddled with people having issues with understanding what their partner wants because *they* (not their partners) have some major hang up about thinking they *know* what their partner *should* want.  Invariably, what these people think their partners *should* want lines up almost perfectly (what a coincidence!) with that person's own insecurities - heavier girls think their boyfriend can't want them because they're curvy, skinny girls know for certain that their men *need* a woman with more curves and bigger breasts, every man ever thinks his woman wants someone with a larger penis, bald men think their wives yearn for a man with a thick, lush head of hair, you name it, the list goes on and on and on.  But the point is, these people have total blinders on to what their partners are usually telling them *directly to their faces* that they like or want.  \n   \nI'll tell you from personal experience, in my 43 years on this planet, I've never met *anyone* who innately or intuitively just *knows* what I want or like better than *I* do.\n   \nHe's literally telling you that he wants to do this.  Repeatedly.  *Why on earth* are you **choosing** not to believe him?  Why do you have it in your head that this is something that he wouldn't or shouldn't enjoy?  Where's that coming from?  Body shame?  Something someone told you about \"what men like\" once?  Maybe not knowing how to act while he's doing it?  There's a reason you think he's *lying* to you here - what is it?\n   \nBecause, bottom line, yes.  There are tons of men who would happily spend all damned day with the woman they love planted firmly on their faces.  Your boyfriend certainly appears to be one of them.\n   \nQuit thinking you know what he likes (or \"should\" like) better than he does and learn how to relax and *enjoy* yourself.

The BU will create a common currency within five years that can be used side by side with their own currency if they wish.\n\nRuters has confirmed multiple countrys are in direct talks with Great Britain now on future membership. Several of those country's have already asked to join and others will hold enter and/or exit elections by the end of next year. \n\nThe confirmed and rumored list of countrys joining or negotiating to join now includes: \n\nThe three EEA country's; (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). \n\nNon affiliated (Switzerland). \n\nEU member the (Netherlands) and also the three immigration hot spot EU countrys; (Hungary, Greece and Italy).\n\nTurkey.\n\nThe deligation from Catalonia was denied immediate BU consideration for now until their succession plan from Spain is legally voted on. The British have promised to aggressively push Spain to allow a binding vote on succession by 2019. \n\nSaid British officials: Scotland's succession vote should be the democratic template for not only Catolania but any minority areas in Europe who wish to separate and break away from their parent country and join the BU if they wish. Severely escalating economic sanctions and trade embargos will be used by the BU until those countrys realize its democratic obligations.\n\nLondon will be the new hub of an expected (US)/ $7-$9 trillion common economy.\n\n-Winston Churchill reporting, back from the dead. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApproximate GDP in US dollars:\n\nGreat Britain: 3 trillion.\nIceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (EEA country's): 700 billion.\nSwitzerland: 800b ( neither EEA or EU but still allowed in single market).\nNetherlands: 1trillion.\nHungary, Italy, and Greece: 2.5t (EU members with emigration hot zones).\nTurkey: 750b.\n\n(British Economic Union Total GDP ~U.S. 8 trillion).\n\n(EU GDP before British Exit: US/$18.5 trillion) \n(EU GDP after British Economic Union : US/$10-12.5 trillion).\n\nOftentimes the best defense is a good offense.

He's headed straight for the [nirvana fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/134/Nirvana-Fallacy)\n\nTo start, nobody is saying trade (or even free trade) is inherently bad. The point being made is the established rules of trading we're talking about are heavily weighted against the average individual. OP is asserting that there are clearly improvements that can be made for the common man, and that current systems don't serve residents of Canada like they originally claimed to, they were misrepresented and abused and loopholed to death. \n\nTo present the idea that trade deals made by people Canadians elected could be more fair for the average Canadian is not saying \"Abolish all trade\", like /u/biskelion seems to be trying to imply. Note that he avoids commenting on the issues at hand (free trade unfairness, corporations taking advantage, resources being stripped and sold with little value returned, jobs being outsourced to other countries/temp foreign workers) and tries to turn it into his own debate, which was never the original point of the post. \n\nNobody ever said \"Trading should cease forever\" but he's implying that's what OP is saying, while ignoring all pertinent points OP made. Much like a politician, he's trying to disenfranchise OP without even acknowledging the original points being made, those have been completely ignored and glossed over in favor of starting up a totally new, irrational \"discussion\" of his choice. So not only is the reader distracted, they also subconsciously see /u/biskelion as reasonable (\"Trade is a good thing, what he's saying makes sense\") and /u/RCAvict0r as unreasonable (\"Why does /u/RCAvict0r think ALL trade should stop? Why does he think we should build everything in our homes\"?) all while making you forget the original discussion entirely (are so-called free trade agreements really all that fair for the average person?) AND perhaps not recognize the fact that /u/RCAvict0r never once said any of those irrational things /u/biskelion is implying he did. \n\nOften an effective tactic when used in front of, say, a town hall full of Trump supporters. Not so much here, where you just come off as ridiculous and people like me are just chomping at the bit to put your style of worthless bullshit under the microscope so that reasonable discussions might continue to occur. \n\nBut anyways, biskelion, go ahead and finish your \"black or white only\" comparison despite the sea of grey those two little islands rest in.

When we look at crime statistics, we can very clearly see that \"assault rifles\" play a negligible role in gun crime.\n\nEven the department of Justice, in an analysis of the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, stated that \"Should it be renewed, the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,\"\n\nNow I'm of the opinion that we do need to revise certain gun laws, but it's important that we take measure we can reasonably believe to have an effect.

There are times where my 9 iron and my 5 iron go the same distance, as it isn't uncommon for me to line-drive my 9 way more than I should, and to not get enough air under my 5-iron for it to carry very well.\n\nThis is all in addition to the huge variability regarding topping the ball, crazy slices, etc., that plague my game. The following is my typical thought process for choosing a club for each shot:\n\n**1)** Am I on the tee on a par 4 or 5? Use the driver, unless I've sliced my driver into the woods on the past 2-3 holes, in which case I will just give up with it and use a low iron.\n\n**2)** Am I still really far away, but on the fairway? Use my 3 wood. But only once per day. Then I remember that I suck with my 3 wood, and that I should never use it.\n\n**3)** After I have used up my one 3-wood hit of the day, I use a low iron (at random) or my 5 hybrid when I am still far away from the hole. This works decently about 60% of the time. The other 40% of the time I am looking for my ball in the woods or just dropping near where I lost it to speed up the game. Still 60% better than the 3 wood.\n\n**4)** As I get closer, it becomes a crap-shoot. Under 100 yards? Then use a PW. 100-150, use a 9 iron. 150-180, use either an 8 or a 7, depending on which club I feel like yelling at. Above 180? I use a 6 or a 5, again just whichever I feel like blaming my bad shot on.\n\n**5)** Par 3s --\u0026gt; Windy? 7 iron. Not windy? 8 iron. Super short? 9 iron. Done.\n\n**6)** Chipping?

In the long run - decades - maybe it could establish itself as it, with the leagues or worlds best players playing in a FIFA style World Cup format. But right now hockey and the Winter Olympics need each other and they need the NHL to be there every year. It's been this way for 20 years now and in that time the game of hockey has grown exponentially in the US and overseas. \n\nThe NHL needs to be consistent. It's players want to be there. The fans want them to be there. We all know the risks of breaking up the season for the Olympics, and what it does to star players participating and the massive costs of insurance, but not being in Korea as a precursor to China in 2022 would be a massive mistake for the league to grow the sport of Hockey in Asia.\n\nAnd I think we as hockey fans want the games best players playing their hearts out in a best on best - country vs. country - format for the world to see. Hockey deserves that sort of recognition and despite the cost for the NHL, so does the league.","score":"23","subreddit":"hockey"}

Basically he's been racing for 10-11 years whereas his peers like Kmag and Stoffel have been racing for around 18-19 years, as they started racing when they were 6-7 years old.

There's even a video on \"how to argue better.\"\n\nI think this advice will be good for you because from what you've written I don't think you guys really do know why you're arguing.

{"body":"The Haka is the last thing the ABs do before they play, and frankly it's all the other things that are done *before* the game that makes up 90% of your victory. \n\nNo one is born with a rugby ball in their hand, and so natural talent can be disregarded to some degree. I don't think NZers have any genetic advantage over the rest of the world.\n\nTactics change as the game evolves, and NZ has consistently displayed an ability to evolve its game plan.\n\nFrom toddler to test, NZ has the best player development system in the world. Partly, that's a product of culture - everyone is a rugby expert in NZ (or thinks they are, because they care about the game). But I think the main reason NZ dominates is because of the way the NZRU has structured the domestic game. A singular brand and vehicle to raise resources and create a culture focussed on the success of the national team (hence the recent change to other representative sides becoming an 'All Blacks' - 7s, Maori) The centralized model of rugby governance has meant that NZ evenly distributes its rugby resources both horizontally (e.g. across each region) and vertically (through each tier of competition).\n\n- Everything is configured towards strengthening the national team. \n\n- NZRU has several major competitions to draw talent from (Schoolboy*, Club, NPC and Super Rugby) - as well as age-group representative sides that are used to test natural talents. Not only does this provide opportunities for players to develop skills, but also for coaching and support staff. Think how many coaches NZhave exported. Super Rugby and NPC teams all have their own unique style of play informed by a collection of brilliant rugby minds in the coaching teams. These domestic competitions allow for ingenuity and development of tactics and coaching techniques. \n\n- The NZRU doesn't have to argue with Super Rugby franchises over players being released for camp - because they own the franchises. \n\n- Centralised development systems mean huge numbers of players are churned out regularly and this gives NZ the depth to not only field the best XV in the world, but to have 8 other guys who're close to the best in their positions on the bench. And then have another 20 guys waiting in camp who could slot in. This means injuries, player leakage and attrition have minimal impact. And it also means that on top of excellent fitness, NZ can throw fresh legs on in the last 20 minutes who are highly skilled, impact players and not 'second-bests'. \n\n*Think for a minute about the importance of testing players as young as 15 or 16 in high-pressure environments - Dan Carter says that his High School grudge match was the most intense scrutiny he'd felt in a rugby game. The fierceness of domestic competitions forces coaches and players to learn to deal with pressure and innovate.","score":"70","subreddit":"rugbyunion"}

{"body":"Rule of thumb is that chemicals comprised of small-ish fat soluble molecules penetrate the skin more easily when applied with a fat-based medium, like cremes and pastes. The more water soluble a substance is, the larger the molecule is and the less fat based the medium is (either water based or solid/dry/powdery), the less likely it is to actually penetrate the skin, enter the blood stream and act throughout the entire blood system. The larger the skin surface you rub it in the more will penetrate, and the more damaged the skin is (wounds, inflammation, infection for example) the more will penetrate, the thinner the skin is (skin at the back vs skin on the scalp) the more will penetrate. That being said, we're still talking about trace amounts entering the central blood stream in either case, as the skin doesn't actively resorb substances, instead substances have to diffuse throughout the skin into the blood stream. Rubbing a large surface of your entire body with progesterone cream (progesterone being entirely fat soluble and a small enough molecule; the body doesn't need much overall progesterone at all) is a different story than putting a bit of dry make-up on a couple of select few surfaces on your face. The main component in bleach based hair dying products, hydrogen peroxide, is constantly produced and metabolized in the body in trace amounts already, and the miniscule amount added by resorbing through the skin (which can lead to skin irritation and chemical burn) is metabolized before it can even hit the blood stream in meaningful quantities. Additionally, in some legislations cosmetic products have legal limitations in how deep their main components are allowed to be able to penetrate the skin.","score":"16","subreddit":"askscience"}

I'd also like to point out that for Mariners fans, this series was a weekday series that only truly gained playoff implications last week after our winning streak. Not that it really excuses the low turnout, but it is what it is.\n\nI'm a Mariners fan so obviously I'm disappointed with both our low fan turnout and our mediocre product on the field, but I hate all the animosity I'm seeing in this thread from both sides.

It was the kind of place you could take your side-piece or your wife to get some privacy away from LA.\n\nIn the 1950s, there was a salad diet craze in LA. Big names were bringing women who were refusing to eat tri-tip and beans at every meal. Ranch Dressing was invented so the Hidden Valley Dude Ranch could offer a vaguely \"Western\" salad. \n\nIt was so popular, guests would ask for bottles to bring home. It became the \"hip\" thing in Hollywood to put on salad or offer as a dip with appetizers.  Restaurants started making approximations.  By 1960, recipes were appearing in women's magazines and the family shut down the ranch to so they could make Ranch full time. \n\nThe original Hidden Valley Ranch is now a retreat for at-risk youth and church groups.  Hidden Valley left Santa Barbara to make a bigger facility in Colorado. ","score":"35","subreddit":"nfl"}

A huge amount of misinformation came out that was never corrected (including that the Patriots filmed other teams' practices/walkthroughs which never happened, that the team was doing this for years when really it spanned two quarters of one game, that Goodell privately destroyed the tapes to protect the Patriots' image when in reality he showed them to the media to prove how mundane and pointless the footage was, etc).\n4.

If the value was much lower, people wouldn't open that many boxes (which would then make the desirable cards harder to find, pushing their price up, making the average box value... about $100 again, usually.)\n\nSo... now we've got these extra-mythic cards, they're going to be expensive on the secondary market, which contributes to the average-value-per-box (even if most boxes don't have one)... since the Masterpieces are contributing to that, the rest of the cards will be worth less to maintain that equilibrium.","score":"61","subreddit":"magicTCG"}

Fans played their arena PvP at Blizzcon before D3 release and thought it was awesome, but Blizz said it wasn't properly balanced and refused to put out something unfinished. Blizz says it's just too difficult to balance D3 as a PvE and PvP game - they did not want to ruin the PvE experience in order to accommodate PvP. It is more likely that we one day see a form of PvEvP rather than PvP - in other words, players competing against each other to kill monsters, rather than to kill each other.

I now know years later that in his replies he was using reasoning straight from Dawkins against her creationist argument, and he asked if either of us had ever read Dawkins (neither of us had, at that point).\n\nHe asked the sister if she considered herself \"open-minded\" - she confidently replied: \"yes I would\". He then asked her a simple question which visibly irritated the pioneer sister: \"What evidence would it take to change your mind about there being a creator?\" From there, the sister didn't really have a good answer for that - basically along the lines of: \"I'm so convinced by the bible, I can't imagine what sort of evidence it would take\" indicating really in fact she was pretty closed-minded about the matter.\n\nI was already having my doubts at that time, but that conversation stuck in my mind enough (as it still does) as somewhat of a catalyst for myself actually starting to look for evidence about what I was supposed to be believing in.","score":"14","subreddit":"exjw"}

I work for one of the departments that is not with the Pay Centre,  I repeat,  I do not work at the Pay Centre (sorry but I did an AMA a while ago and there was a lot of confusion toward that) ANYWAY,  what I came here to say is that yes,  there was a serious lack of training - 4 days of a broad overview of the system...but that's not what the problem is.  The problem is Phoenix.  As much as they want to make you believe it's not,  it is. Things are not working they way they are supposed to.  The system is programmed to do certain things but it just doesn't.  You do x number of the same transactions for 10 employees,  6 work and 4 don't.  But all the information is entered the exact same for all and it's correct.  So that's not the administrative error with the input,  that's something wrong with the system.  I want to say though that I find the biggest issue now is that the darn thing is just down,  A LOT.. Because we have figured out how to do a lot of things on our own,  by trial and error but for days it will be either so slow that you get timed out before you can finish what you are doing or it just doesn't work at all.  So when I spend 2 days trying to get my work done but I can't because the system is not working,  that's not a lack of training.  That's Phoenix.  The compensation community is working their asses off,  not just at the pay centre,  to get things working properly.  But how are we expected to do our work and get things back to normal when we can't even have a system that runs properly.  I guess that's what makes my blood boil the most.  We are all working like absolute dogs to fix this insane mess of theirs and when they can't hit that deadline (because it was so ridiculous and unrealistic in the first place) the blame will be placed squarely on us.

{"body":"I think the things Twain said about her work were very, very funny, but unlike other work he criticized, his witticisms about Austen are never specific about what she does poorly. \n\nThe article in the OP quotes the entirety of Twain's unfinished essay about Austen where he jokes that he is examining only the first third of one book because that's all he could stand, and proceeds to quote and reference parts of the end of that same book. His criticisms of her characters are mostly just accurate summations of them, down to infuriating superficiality which is pretty obviously intentional and crucial to the themes she is creating.\n\nIt's funny to me that the article in OP does not really support the title of the reddit post. At best, the author of the article is uncertain that he really disliked Austen, offering that he secretly saw a great deal of common ground between what they each attempted to accomplish through their writing.\n\nI read that evidence and take the position that it is simply one of Twain's most elaborate gags; He expresses distaste for Austen at the slightest provocation that is extreme and seemingly unjustified but always seems to allude to repeated readings and familiarity with the whole body of her work. He basically makes himself a character that doesn't \"get\" Jane Austen in a way that many (even today) seem to not \"get\" Mark Twain.\n\nI think that view is better-supported than the idea that he genuinely thought she was terrible.","score":"171","subreddit":"todayilearned"}

{"body":"i have done a few hikes that are also set up by touring companies, Tour du mont blanc, sections of the JMT, etc. i see the difference in the experiences though and don't think that what they provide is a waste of money. i personally don't think i need most touring services because i am well experienced in hiking and camping but many are not.  so although a guide to hiking in Patagonia seems like a great and useful thing, disavowing the outdoor touring service completely seems like too much.\n\nHere are some things that i think tour guides provide that may not be worth the money to you, but to others it may be worth it\n\n- Logistics! planning big trips can be a nightmare for most people, and depending on your job, time is money, sometimes a lot!\n\n- Safety. As experienced of a hiker you may be, maybe a new territory brings new challenges. I am sure you have heard of stories about people getting injured and dying due to not being ready for the dangers.. this kinda thing is typically avoided by touring groups. Here is a gif of what looks like experienced people saving the lives of less experienced people in the andes: http://i.imgur.com/pcQ8sWz.gifv i may have even died to that, never seen anything like that.\n\n- Food. Usually the food touring groups provide is way better than what i am bringing.. mountain houses and ramens. \n\n- Labor: Spending time to cook and set up group areas seems included in the price, maybe pack animals to carry things in? some people don't like much of the physical labor that some of us love, or maybe they are not physically capable due to injury. \n\n- Supporting locals: some touring groups are run by locals and that is how they make their living. we come in as rich travelers but we want to pinch every penny, when a penny means a lot more to them.\n\n- Gear. Sometimes they provide some, which is not some trivial amount of money, especially if your alternative is buying.\n\n- Lodging and transportation. this is the biggest factor, lodging and transit has the biggest variable cost. yes sleeping in a crappy tent and finding the cheapest buses or hitching is the cheapest thing, but that is part of the experience, and people decide whether or not that is for them. i've slept many nights under the stars and can still appreciate a beautiful warm meal and shower at a mountain refuge.\n\nanyway, yes some tour agencies still seem to mark up their prices a lot for what they give you, but i think it is worth while reinforcing what they provide compared to what i would do planning it myself.","score":"20","subreddit":"CampingandHiking"}

{"body":"I love this type of question because I love the business of live shows.  From what I can tell there are four parties here involved and the big three are.  \n\nYGE\n\nScooter Braun \n\nSiva Group Ent \n\n\nOf the three who fuck with concerts on this scale from most to least: SGE - \u0026gt; SB -\u0026gt; YGE.  Let's be real -- when was the last time YGE threw small time things that weren't gimmicky, one time things.  That's not their game.  SB is the guy who likely pushed CL to Corden and Corden put a blip on the map for Lifted which is likely the springboard here.\n\nThe real focus here is SGE.  My understanding is that the artist gets X amount of money regardless of who shows, it's likely in their rider and SGE runs the show pays other expenses and nets the profit.  This is pretty standard in the industry and Scooter Braun likely defends his artists well otherwise they would've found new management.  If by SGE's calculation they can sell all their tix for the prices they've set, then they win.  I just don't know many people -- myself included -- who would pay $95 - $300 + whatever fees to go see CL for 90 mins.  So the reach really is on them to try and push a CL solo tour state side in 2000-7000 people venues. I actually think it'll be fine.\n\nKEEP IN MIND -- this is the same group that did the Epik High, Taeyang (not sure about this one), and DEAN US tours and those worked pretty well.\n\nAlso the frame of mind here is very Korean (aren't tours for artists that have...?) and thus flawed because this is a NA tour.  Think of all the unsigned US artists (esp. hip hop) who have limited discographies (pushing mixtapes) doing these type of tours in NA/Aus.  Very common.  Look at Travis Scott for ASAP Rocky in 2014 and you get the same sense.\n\nThere is no loss here for CL/YGE and even SB -- she can't take a real L here stateside but she really doesn't have much to lose -- what she's gonna lose at most promo wise stateside? that Corden flame?  This is the next logical move anyway -- anyone pushing a mixtape goes and tours these small shows - usually in higher frequency and hitting small markets too.  And they're likely doing a lot of covers and on a limited discography too.  She also likely has, in her rider, some level of control over what goes on stage and how she's presented -- won't take a L in performing for whoever shows cause YGE/SB doesn't fuck around there.  Plus history looks pretty good for SGE on pushing YG artists stateside in these venues.  DEAN has like jack for a discography compared to CL + 2NE1 and he did well.\n\nedit: so some bg: in college all of my internships were in the music industry and so I got see how it worked.  I hated being paid shit and not being able to afford tix for shows I was working on (still got to \"see\" them because I was working - shouts to anyone who remembers people at the merch booths at the map the soul tour) so I became a mgmt consultant instead.\n\n","score":"32","subreddit":"kpop"}

{"body":"Here's my take on it. I believe each of the dragons' weaknesses are directly connected to their greatest strengths. I see a lot of people complain that Mordremoth's weakness being his mind doesn't make sense, but I think it works perfectly. The mind is his main strength and method of attack, but attacking with his mind leaves an opening that can be exploited. It's not that Mordremoth's mind is especially weak, it's his weakness because through his mental attacks, he opens the door and leaves himself vulnerable mentally. \n\nLikewise, look at Zhaitan. His strength seems to lie in his minions. Not only does he have a massive army, but it actually grows with every battle, because he raises his fallen enemies. But I think his minions, or more accurately his *reliance* on his minions, is his weakness. Think about how we defeated him: yes we shot him with a big laser, but before that we severely weakened him by eliminating key minions; the Mouth and Eyes. \n\nThe only other dragon I can speculate on is Kralkatorrik, because we've already seen a plan that could have killed him. According to Glint, the spear was capable of killing Kralkatorrik because it was made from his body. What if *that* is Kralkatorrik's strength, and his weakness, his body? It makes sense, being the dragon of crystal and earth and stuff like that, that his body would be physically tough, with powerful spines and scales nearly impossible to pierce. But that could also be a weakness: his body is *so* tough, and his spines are *so* sharp, even he can't withstand a blow from a weapon made from a part of himself.","score":"60","subreddit":"Guildwars2"}

{"body":"*^doot ^doot*\n\n\"... No... Please god no I didn't hear it, just the imagination of tired hunger, the wind, maybe its the fear getting to me --that must be it-- just go back to sleep.\"\n\nI tried to force my eyes closed, to think about being in a comfortable house, clouds and sheep and fairy floss and all manner of calming songs raced through my mind, trying to hold back the flood of fear racing up my spine. But raced too fast, too fast to be calming, I was just working myself up at that point. I unzipped the sleeping bag and sat up, it looked to be a former church maybe, now just a semi-organised collection of old bricks, none reaching higher than my shoulder, a good campsite, the former walls permitted me a fire that dark night, for which I was thankful.\n\nThe coals of the fire were still warm if I got real close, so I did just that. Slipping on my boots I felt the greeting of the cold, crawling to the former fire I felt the moisture on my hands and knees, and then the warmth of the fire seeping through my tired muscles; All sensations of the past, lost to me now. I was contemplating finishing the cashew packet that formed the last of my morsels when I heard it again.\n\n...*^doot doot*\n\nI felt fear grip every part of my body at that moment; not only had my earlier fears been confirmed, but I had ignored the first blast, and now they were closer. I debated my options then, I had but two; I could flee across the open field, eastward into the forest, where my fear was that they would see me and run me down. Or I could stay where I was and hide in the ruin, my fear being that if they found me, I was likely to be immediately surrounded, and with empty field around me, they would see and undo any attempt at escape unless I run now.\n\nI decided to stay. That ~~mistake~~ decision was to be the last one of my flesh life. \n\nI doused the fire with dirt and a little water, laid on my stomach, and peeked around the former outer wall of the church, only to hear the skeletal ones take a new quarry. Too dark to see anything more than maybe twenty metres, but it sounded like a girl. The screams lasted a few minutes, what they did to their victims, I could only guess up until later that night. The poor girls last moments of terror provided me with help however, for I now knew the direction of the horde.\n\nAs I moved my belongings toward the wall facing their direction, (so as to be entirely hidden from them), I realised I was getting closer to the altar at the back of this small former house of religion, it somehow comforted me, even though I'd never seen myself as religious among my fellow men. And so there I sat, huddled up against the ruins of the old world's \"house of salvation\", whilst outside the hordes of the undead, roved and mutilated, unchecked against humanity's very will to stay alive. I almost laughed at the utter pessimism and bleakness of the situation, when I heard that dreadful noise again.\n\n*doot doot*\n\nThey'd gotten closer --much closer-- since they found the girl a few minutes ago. I knew I was in trouble when I heard the rattling; the rattling of the unliving horde, like a million chattering teeth, like a multitude of wind-chimes in an angry storm. And they were only getting closer. As I debated the option of running in my mind, I felt the dark, cold hand of utterly hopeless fear clutch my very heart and squeeze tight. I'll never forget the sensations of that night.\n\nI'd passed into a state of near catatonia by the time they were all around the church, eyes wide with terror, shaking uncontrollably while huddled in the corner. But they were passing by like a wave around a rock. It was unbelievable that they hadn't seen me yet, like the church was proving to be too consecrated for the armies of darknes. I hoped that was the case... With everything I had, I tried to hold onto hope. I saw some get as much as maybe ten metres past the churches low walls, by the time one walked inside the church... Just one, he simply strolled inside as if there were nothing out of place, as if it were any normal day, as if he hadn't just crushed all my hopes of survival and brought to life my greatest fear at that very moment with those few steps. He walked toward the back of the church where I sat, then he looked at me.\n\nAnd that was it for my flesh life.\n\nI remember flashes of what transpired next, a scramble as perhaps I tried to escape. Being held down on the altar of the church and staring up at the cracked cross of the old world. The mind-melting rage as I cursed the false god and the skeletal demons. **The house of salvation didn't do a thing to save me that night. Not as the bloodied horde approached. Not as they entered the hallowed ground and pinned me to the altar. Not as they tore off my clothes with their hands. NOT AS THEY GATHERED TO WATCH LIKE IT WAS A GAME. NOT AS THEY TOOK OUT THEIR KNIVES. NOT AS THEY CUT INTO MY FLESH WITH THEIR BLADES. NOT AS THEY OPENED AND GUTTED ME ON THE ALTAR OF THE SAVIOR. NOT AS THEY TORE AWAY THE MEAT THAT MADE ME THE CREATURE I WAS**\n\n...Not as I stayed awake and lucid, begging for death at the hands of the so called merciful lord, long after my tongue was taken and tossed aside...\n\n...Not as he, the most vile and unholy, Lord of the skeletons walked into the room and began the ritual chant as the others played their twisted instruments.\n\nNot as I arose again, spirit broken, body carved, mind twisted and soul bound to his will.\n\nI don't know why I sit here writing this. Perhaps because I am regretful of how my old life ended, perhaps because it's the only way I can communicate now without the infernal instruments, perhaps because I was just surprised to discover the ability to write still lay within these hands, perhaps because I was fearful no human part of me remained in this skeleton. Whatever my reasoning, I'm one of them now, the infernal skeletons, part of his horde, following his commands, listening, waiting for the sound to hunt.\n\nAs much as it brings me pain to write, as much as I despise myself for thinking so, especially after all I've done in this form.\n\nI'm thankful not to be dead. That my soul still lingers on. Even in this horrible horrible form.\n\nIf I could still shed tears of hatred, I would. If I could scream in agony, I would. But thanks to him I'm alive, thanks to him I needn't step over the precipice of oblivion.\n\nI hate everything that I am, but am too much of a coward to want anything else.\n\nThank mr Skeltal.","score":"26","subreddit":"worldbuilding"}

So when the day is slow but they won't let you leave, you just sit there stewing in your own seething frustration that you're not doing shit, can't study, and know they if you could be let go, you could go to where studying is possible and have some free time at the end of the day. \n\nHowever, seeing something IRL to then see it in a Qbank or vice versa I think REALLY hammers the information. Unfortunately that doesn't always happen.\n\nFurthermore, there's just a whole bunch of idiosyncrasies of medicine/your hospital/the service that you need to learn because I know that if I studied purely from books and not seeing patients third year, I may be able to crush concepts, but I'd get bogged down in all the other shit. \n\nMaybe that's where a half day and then home to study could compromise with both ends of the spectrum?

Samsung though I just can't see them being the 4th best team at this tournament.  I would put them at a somewhat distant 5th.  I think they hit a hotstreak in the gauntlet and CoreJJ played the series of his life.  I just see them as another NJWS.  Honestly after ROX I see a huge gap, then EDG, then a decent gap to SKT and TSM, then another pretty big gap to Samsung and RNG.  \n\nI don't even think TSM has done anything special in the last couple months.  It's just that I'm seeing red flags from RNG, SKT, and Samsung. Before all the playoffs and regionals happened, I would've said TSM was the 6th best team, after ROX, KT, EDG, SKT, and RNG.  Now they could almost be 3rd by default.\n\nAlso really down on RNG atm.  They looked pretty ass in playoffs, and their interview made it seem like they have no confidence in themselves. Still when it comes down to it they can overpower a lot of teams in standard lanes.\n\nG2's stock is also rising by the week for me.  Their team has really great players, and I think the bootcamp will help them tremendously.  C9 is the same story with them improving week-to-week leading up to Worlds.\n\nOutside of ROX and EDG, maybe SKT if they pull it together, and TSM if they keep progressing, everyone is so ridiculously beatable in the group stage and no one can coast into the knockout stage.  I'm expecting a pretty crazy group stage with at least one Korean team going out and maybe 2 Chinese teams.\n\nI would go\n\n1. ROX\n2. EDG\n3. SKT\n4. TSM\n5. Samsung\n6. RNG\n7. G2\n8.

That all said, Rodeo is much more varied, a lot of BITTSM sounds like songs a lot of artists could make (Beibs in the Trap, Outside), I don't think anyone could pull of Rodeo except Travis. I do love BITTSM and I love Rodeo, but they are very different in my opinion, Rodeo is a Travis Scott album, it is a story, and has personal meanings.

{"body":"Well let’s start at the beginning. Early in high school, I wore big black rocker T-shirts, destroyed old vans, and crusty jeans. I had long greasy hair and a pencil thin white boy mustache and the most awkward, shy personality ever. [This was me then](http://i.imgur.com/tqKx82m.jpg). This look does not attract many girls. I decided I needed to make a life change and improve my overall appearance, and in doing so, improve my overall confidence.\n\nI first replaced my shoes with nice (yet cheap) dress shoes and people noticed. This one girl I had never spoken to said she liked my shoes in passing in the hallway. That felt pretty nice. I started wearing button-ups, and nicely fitting clothing, and I cut my hair. I also started exercising a lot. By the end of my transformation I looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Pl5ygfP.jpg) and working out left me looking like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/Tqv2jI9.jpg)\n\nWearing good fitting, stylish clothes not only make you more physically attractive, but also boost your confidence A LOT. The two most important things is how you look and your confidence. (A good personality helps too, but realistically no one will care about that if you’re ugly and shy.) \n\nEventually, I was comfortable with myself to the point where girls would approach me. That made things a lot easier. That girl who had told me she liked my shoes ended up becoming one of my romantic interests later in the year and she apparently had no prior recollection of me or that event at all before I improved myself and made myself memorable.\n\nIt takes such an immense amount of effort to transform yourself, but the payoff is amazing. People respect you and take you seriously.\n\nOne specific example I can use is my senior year girlfriend. One of my friends told me her friend thought I was cute, so I met her. She was pretty shy but honestly it was kind of sweet. It was literally that simple. All I had to do was ask to hang out and that was it. When you are confident and comfortable with yourself, other people pick up on that. If you listen to any dating advice ever, people will tell you if you're confident, you're good. That is apparently the most attractive quality a man can have. [Here is us at a winter Formal event.](http://i.imgur.com/v4RcwB7.jpg) You can even see in my posture that I'm comfortable and confident. If you slouch a lot and drag your feet, you're almost guaranteed to feel less confident. (Fun Fact: this girl had actually won Thailand's Got Talent and later was on that ABC show Rising Star) \n\nYou can do exactly what I did. Obviously I wasn't blessed with ideal genes but I worked so hard to get to where I am, and if I can do it, anyone can. Most people think the key to being attractive is only how they look or talk, but how they feel is truly the most important.\n\nIf you can just spend time on yourself and make yourself what you want to be, people will take notice.\n\nThe three major keys:\n\n-CONFIDENCE\n\n-STYLISH, WELL FITTING CLOTHES\n\n-WORK ETHIC\n\nHow to achieve the three major keys:\n\n-Get a nice haircut\n\n-Work out\n\n-Dress well\n\nThat is literally it.\n\nNow I know this may not be exactly what you're looking for because you want to talk to girls NOW. The truth is, the work is cut out for you if you just focus on YOURSELF then others.\n\nI know I was extremely repetitive but that's just because it's important.\n\nTL;DR: Become who you want to be and girls will probably just like that person by default.\n\nThis takes time and an immense amount of effort but eventually pays off.\n\n[This is basically me now by the way.](http://i.imgur.com/tXvqZhm.jpg)","score":"40","subreddit":"teenagers"}

Overall, it's not a bad place to be. \n\nYou have easy access to buses that go straight to New York and to Journal Square.\n\nYou'd definitely find a decent apartment in the $1,500 - $1,000 range in that area. Two bedrooms go for $1,500 in The Heights, you'd definitely find a decent 1 bedroom at that price.\n\nNewport, The Village, and Paulus Hook get kind of pricey. If you're looking for just 1.6k, keep those out of the question. If you do manage to find a place at 1.5k near Newport, it probably isn't that great.\n\nWest Side and Bergen/Lafayette also isn't very *safe* either. Maybe not as bad as Greenville, but if safety is a priority to you, just keep it as a last resort. You'll definitely find a decent place at 1.5k/month in that area. \n\nTd;Lr (*although you should read*) The Heights is definitely where you should look.","score":"17","subreddit":"jerseycity"}

I learned to shuck clams and oysters. I did basic prep in those years, like breading fish and shrimp. I also had to scrub down the back parking lot, clean the prep area, take out the garbage, etc.\n\nThen I worked two years in a fry shack (it was a high-volume place and was basically trial by fire). \u0026gt;1000 covers a night at peak season on a four-man line. They had NY strips, so I learned to cook temps. One guy just shucked oysters and clams all night, sometimes it was me.\n\nThen I solo cooked breakfast for a few summers, which also helped my speed on the line and expediting skills. I worked as a line cook in winter at a 5 star hotel for the same couple of years. basically an upscale version of the fry shack. \n\nMoved up to the main kitchen at my winter gig in the third year. Worked sauté - introduced my own specials. My summer job changed to a fine-dining mom \u0026amp; pop place, where I learned a lot more about kitchen management. I worked the sauté and grill stations. Worked as a breakfast cook simultaneously part-time for extra money. \n´\nThen I got a job as assistant chef at a place when the assistant chef walked out. Chef was a drunk German guy who got fired, took his place. Ran the kitchen with a young guy who was hired as dishwasher. Good reviews, worked two summers there.\n\nWinter gig was going well too, but I started to realize that nobody in the business had a normal social life or good relationships and most were high-functioning drunks or worse.\n\nDecided to go back to University. Worked summers and 5 years after until I got my current job in my field. Married with kids and glad I don't have to clean behind the grill or make someone clean behind the grill anymore, but I also miss it - it was a real adventure.\n\n","score":"20","subreddit":"Chefit"}

There's not much to say, except perhaps that the calendar is your friend, and before you know it, you'll be looking back at her death from a month, a year, five years....   You'll integrate the grief more than get over it.  \n\nShe'll be part of every day.   One day, you'll be able to talk about her and remember her realistically, and no kidding, she is part of you now.  (I am a rabid atheist, but accept that our loved ones live in our memories.  They touched us at one point, made us who we are just like our parents and our teachers and the water and food we consumed, and all the things we learned.... they are part of US as humans.  We carry them, share their experiences and lessons and values and that's their immortality.  We keep them going.)\n\nThe thing is... death is a gift of sorts to those of us who escape it briefly.  Ours will be here soon enough, but losing someone close makes us aware of how short and unpredictable our time here is, and can be the basis for the daily consciousness of that fact.   It can help us to become better at living on many levels, and I feel sometimes that it's a role I owe my late wife.  She'd want to be happy and she'd want me to be happy, too, and to lead as good a life as I can.\n\nRight now, for you it's all raw nerve.  The weight of the planet.  Crushing.  Nothing to be done but endure in the short term.    In the long term, you will smile and love again.  You'll think of her and smile, not cry, and perhaps like me you'll wake up 5 or 10 years down the road and wonder where she is and how you got to wherever you are.  And while it's confusing, the dreams sometimes are so real it's like touching her and being in her presence and it's a gift of unpredictable joy.  \n\nI got a lot of comfort reading C.S.

He smiled revealing row of impeccably sharp teeth. \n\n\"You know the big 'M' on the clock tower stands for 'monster' right?\" The oaf bellowed at a volume obviously inappropriate for a personal conversation.\n\n\"I'm aware,\" I said smugly, looking down at my food while watching the chlorine bleached Ugg boot out of my peripheral vision. \n\n\"And just,\" He leaned in closer and allowed his surprisingly minty breath to waft over me, \"What is a sad sack of mince meat like you capable of anyways?\"\n\nBy then the whole school had gathered round. I knew that they all had been wondering the same thing. I don't blame them. My small soft body and unimpressive limbs were an insult to every creature that walked the halls of this place.\n\n\"You see, I've done my research,\" I stated with a slow confident cadence. \"You are all capable of doing horrible things. I've seen the videos of goats and cows being ripped apart. I've seen you fight lions and bears.\"\n\nMultiple \"yeah's\" and \"that's right's\" sounded off in crowd.\n\nI stood up and began to point into the mob, \"But if I asked you to turn on your own, would you do it? If I asked you to kill your friends; your own blood, would you have the guts?\"\n\nEddy slammed chia pet fist into the table. \"Don't be ridiculous. We have enough to deal with, why would we kill each other?\"\n\n\"Because, that's what we humans consider a monster,\" I glared into his eyes, \"Our history books are filled to the brim with the blood of our own and continue to be filled to this day.\" I looked out into the crowd. The jeering had grown to nervous whispers.\n\n\"You all have survived by working together, using your claws and teeth to fight the elements and forces that oppose you. We humans,\" I paused, \"we have built kingdoms on the backs of our own kind. We have walls lined with bones of the slaves that built them. We have graves of full men and women who were killed simply because they didn't fit a standard. To this day, we constantly trade oil for blood.\" \n\nSilence gripped the audience. Eddy retreated from the table and stood with the rest.\n\nI picked up my tray and scanned the crowd once again. In a serious, stoic tone I explained, \"In my opinion, you're not monsters. I've studied your history. I've read your doctrines. And I've found that you are more \"human\" than we can ever hope to be.\" \n\nWith that, I turned and walked out of the cafeteria leaving behind a room of curious murmurs. It wasn't long until the double doors burst open behind me with monsters pouring out and shouting questions at the new kid in town.\n\n\n\n","score":"79","subreddit":"WritingPrompts"}
{"body":"From the moment the sudden pain bolts its way through your chest, you know something is terribly wrong, more so than your other internal injuries caused by the beating you have been taking at the hands of your opponent.\n\nYou watch as the level of your gaze drifts towards the mat, the expression on your opponents face, as well as that of the nearby referee, becoming confused as they see you fall towards your knees, a motion that seems to take an eternity for you as the lights all around you seem to blur into a singular, blinding spotlight.\n\n“Is this…”\n\nFeeling beads of sweat turn ice cold against your bruised skin, your body feels eerily relaxed as your eyelids grow heavy and mind begins to fade.\n\n“… Is this my limit..?”\n\nYou quietly mutter to yourself as you resign your fate to that of an unconscious heap on the ground, your beaten form seen by thousands, a suitable visual metaphor for what your career shall be after this bout. But then, a voice.\n\n“I’d like to think not.”\n\nYour eyes open wide, pupils dilating to pinpricks as you suddenly finds yourself looking to a figure ahead of you, their face obscured by the encroaching darkness that threatens to blot out the little light that remain around you.\n\n“Wh… Who are you?”\n\nThe figure lowers their head slightly, a smile now visible as they motion a hand towards you.\n\n“Merely someone who is invested in your success.”\n\n“I-In… … my… success?”\n\nAs you try to comprehend exactly what is going on, it seems that the form before you is growing somewhat impatient. Suddenly, you feel a tight grip on your shoulder as they continue to speak.\n\n“I’ve watched you train up to this point. Fight through sweat, tears, pain, and the pessimistic critics… against all odds, all to get to here… This moment, YOUR moment.”\n\nTaking a second to think, images of the past month begin to flash to your mind, every second that you spent training and readying yourself for your final shot at the world title, to cement your name in the history books. Go for it all, or lose it all trying.\n\nThe voice continues.\n\n“No one could be blamed for stopping here. You’re in pain, you’re tired, and one man’s body can only take so much stress and punishment before it falters. But tell me this.”\n\nManaging to lift your head, you look up to the face that is now much closer to yours but always seems just out of focus enough for you to never get an accurate image of their appearance. With a tight squeeze of your shoulder, they ask.\n\n“Is this how you want to be remembered?”\n\nIn a surge of emotion, you gasp sharply, colour and light rushing back into view all around you as you stop yourself from dropping to your knees an inch before the canvas. Stumbling backward, you see the referee follow you as you fall back into the ropes to catch your breath.\n\n“Hey! Are you okay?”\n\n“… H… huh?”\n\nSlowly bringing yourself back to reality, you see that the referee is speaking but you can’t really hear their words except for the few that matter.\n\n“Do you want to continue?”\n\nGripping your fists tightly, ignoring the aching in your muscles, you feel the stabbing pains in your chest subside and your confidence rushing back into you. With a step forward, you raise yourself back up to your feet and hold your fists up in a ready stance.\n\n“… Absolutely.”\n\nStepping forward, you hear the roar of the crowd as your opponent, thinking they had won, contorts their face into an expression of disbelief as your throw yourself into the fray. \n\nSo you can be remembered the way you always wanted to be.\n\nA champion.","score":"14","subreddit":"WritingPrompts"}

{"body":"General \"Maddog\" Mattis watched through the lens of a drone as an ad-hoc unit of Waffen SS and Israeli Shayetet-13 commandos sliced through an unending horde of imps and hell hounds. At first he incorporated members of the two units together as a joke and as a lesson in humility, however they immediately surprised him in their willingness to kill a common enemy. That was it, all war-fighters need is an enemy, and what greater enemy than sin materialized itself? He was proud his little ad-hoc experiment was working so well. The thought of incorporating some Carthaginians with some Roman legionnaires popped into his head, but he felt the Carthos were already salty enough and the Romans really worked well under their own leadership....in most cases atleast. He had already relieved Varus after the Legatus refused to give him back his legions, and they were doing much better under the leadership of Scipio Africanus. Maddog's radio cracked with static and a voice came through the ether...\"Maddog 1-1 this is \"white feather\" over... \"Maddog 1-1 to white feather, copy, go for message over...\"Sir, I have positive india delta on Lucifer... permission to engage...over.\" \"Maddog 1-1 to white feather you are cleared to engage over...\" Mattis was surprised when he got to hell, the devil was not just one creature but seven distinct identities. Hathcock had spotted Lucifer....known for his pride, he was apparently leading his army from the front, a foolish mistake. With confirmation of the kill Mattis crossed one of the remaining 2 names off of his 7 name list. Only  Satan was left to kill. Mattis thought about his other trophies... Mammon was killed after being lured into a trap by Chesty Puller, all they had to do was lay out a pile of gold and the bastard came sniffing. Chesty killed him with a bayonet....attached to a flame thrower. Asmodeus was killed while in his Harem, Lyudmilla Pavelchenko rolled an rgd-5 right into the middle of one of his oh so famous Thai lady-boy orgies. Mattis laughed at the thought....Asmodeus was a choir boy compared to him A CHOIR BOY!!!!! that mother fucker should have seen what Angeles city in the Philippines looked like in the late 80's. That lazy queef Belphegor was caught surfing reddit on the toilet, Mattis actually felt a little bad for him. Ghenghis had somehow found a way to melt plague and poured it on the poor fucker while his face was stuck in the internets. Beelzbub was the easiest, they just sent a veggie omellete MRE to his abode...he died of constipation 7 days later. Leviathan envious of the power Mattis had been gaining tried to attack him full force, but all he got was a face full of BRRRT. Just one more kill to make, then Mattis could claim his rightful throne. Then the real challenge would begin, finding a way up to heaven. Mattis wasn't too worried, all they would have to do is kick St. Peter in the nuts, open the gate and stroll on in. He already had men on the inside....they might be POG's and never have fought in combat....but the streets in heaven are guarded by Marines, and he knew where their loyalty would lie.","score":"81","subreddit":"WritingPrompts"}

{"body":"\"Art is the ultimate expression of life.\"\n\nThat is what King always answered when asked why he valued it so highly. The life of an immortal is bound to be filled with extraordinary events, regardless of how much the individual avoids it, since no matter how long a period of tranquillity lasts, it will never be eternal. Everything in this universe is impermanent, even peace. \n\nKing learned this lesson through a lifetime of hardship. Losing all of his riches in one century, only to gain even more wealth further down the road. The cyclical nature of history becomes incredibly obvious when you can't die. Empires rise and fall, only to emerge from its ashes once again stronger than before. Just like King's wealth, King's faith in humanity, and King's sense of purpose in the universe.\n\nIt's because of this cyclical nature that King enjoys museums and visits them whenever he has the chance. Sometimes, he would run into relics he had owned before or that belonged to people he knew. It gave him a chance to relive memories he had long forgotten, things he would not have remembered otherwise. \n\nArt museums in particular were a surreal experience to him. They weren't trying to preserve history, they preserved cultures unique to their period. They didn't catalog specific events, they tried to record a snapshot of what life *felt* like back then. Viewing the ideas these people valued back then allowed humans to admire with hindsight what was important back then, and what might be lacking right now. \n\nThis is why, when King saw the newest art exhibition in his city, he almost fell to the ground. His knees started shaking and a cold sweat overpowered him, forcing him to sit on the nearest bench available. It was *him* inside the painting, throwing away a sword with one arm and cradling a fallen comrade with the other. The space he took up wasn't considerable, the painting represented a much bigger scene of chaos, but the level of detail was enough for him to see it was him.\n\nA young woman with a red scarf then approached him and said:\n\n\"Breath-taking isn't it?  *The Fall of Gaia* is our newest addition to the museum. It represents a coup in-\"\n\n\"The empire Gaia, five hundred years ago\" said King. \"One of the bloddiest conflicts of human history to ever take place, resulting in the loss of over a million lives.\"\n\n\"Ahh, you're familiar with that time period? That's very rare to see these days, considering how much was lost during that war. This piece in particular has me infatuated with that era. The viceral nature of the violence depicted, the anguish shown in each of the characters, it just oozes atmosphere, drawing you into the scene like you are there.\"\n\nKing chuckled and said:\n\n\"No, trust me. This doesn't even come close to how horrible it was. You can't hear the screams everywhere or smell the stench of burning flesh. Any person that survived that would wish they died back then, just to get rid of the memories.\" He stood up. \"It's a beautiful painting, though.\" He walked up to the painting. \"You can clearly tell the person who did it was there.\"\n\n\"Yes, the artist was Maxwell Ethyris. He was the emperor's personal artist. Still, it's strange on his part.\"\n\nKing raised his eyebrow before he said:\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"Even though the artist was clearly against the rebels, he still depicted the insurgents in a very herioc light. They look like noble warriors. Graceful and strong, even if they were, technically speaking, the bad guys.\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" King's eyes teared up. \"That's because they *were* heroes.\"\n\n--------------------------------\n\u0026gt;[I already wrote a story about King if you want to read more about him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdEmoKidStories/comments/506cd1/wp_an_immortal_and_a_person_who_reincarnates_with/) Anyway, if you enjoyed this, you can check out more of my stories over at /r/WeirdEmoKidStories!","score":"31","subreddit":"WritingPrompts"}

When you don't fit into the strict confines of \"normal\", women are made to feel like they've failed. Gaining too much? Too little? BP is what, exactly? You're not sleeping well?

I apologized, said I had forgotten it was there, and told them I had flown with it in my bag that morning without incident. I'm curious if my departure airport got a call. They were actually very professional and helpful. They confiscated the ammunition, but allowed me to mail the magazine back to myself. There was a service at that airport for people to mail things that they couldn't fly with and they directed me to them. I was pretty impressed with TSA that day.

{"body":"1. A lot of young people speak english here, so a lot of call center jobs have popped up for companies such as HP, Amazon, and others. Also, there are a lot of online casinos and sportsbooks based here, so also a lot of people are employed by them. Obviously salaries are higher than working in coffee and banana plantations. Intel had a big plant here but they are moving out.\n2. A lot of birds, cows, horses...  I mean, if you go out in the jungle there are tapirs, Dantas (don't know in english), leopards, jags, mountain lions, etc. Lots of iguanas, lizards, etc as well. \n3. In rainy season (march-november kind of) yes. It rains a LOT. Although, i used to rememeber it raining a LOT more often about 10 years ago. I believe (personally) climate change has something to do with this. It can still pour down, but it has gone down. \n4. Usually with gallo pinto you will have tortillas. You can also have a \"gallo\" of something, which is just a tortilla with something inside (a piece of chorizo, beef, chicken, or basically anything you can think of. \n5.

I don;t know these days that much though (im 30 btw)\n6. Uff yes. Everyone basically speaks english for business purposes. \n7. Those holidays are pretty common. Christmas and vday are celebrated like in the USA basically. No day of the dead, halloween is celebrated but not a lot, mostly just costume parties instead of trick or treat.\n8. Heck no, we don't even have an army (nice trivia fact)\n9. Ahh..  i mean, like in every country, tastes abound. Me and my circle of friends have always listened to music in english (classic rock to metal to grunge) Although this band i think is good, they are 100% costa rican but sing in english *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NYXu-LJIxk*   in spanish we have https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6oiho9YJvY  but i don't personally like them, it was just a big hit here years ago. \n10. Corrupt as hell. We don't have an army, but our public schools suck, our roads are terrible, cost of living is sky high (check it, im not kidding).

I feel like its rather necessarry for me to do. From too much stress of the frequent travels to just not enjoying the game as I used to. I hope the break will clear up some things for me, motivate me and hopefully allow me to be a better player when i do come back. Right now i do not have a certain idea how long it will last. I just want to wait til I feel i really want to play and win again.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Of course my decision comes with a certain risk. I feel very sad that it leads to me leaving my teammates in Liquid even though I really enjoy playing with them and im very appreciative of the chances I have gotten in that team. \n\u0026gt; Moreover, im not sure how things are going to be when I decide to engage in competitive play again - Will I be able to find a team that I enjoy playing with, a team that becomes sucessful? But sometimes such risks have to be taken.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; I also just want to say thanks for everything all the guys in Liquid have done for me.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; My teammates Kuro, Matu, Jerax and MC, it was a pleasure to play with you, thanks for constantly trying to improve and moving this team forward. Thanks for all the good times we had together and fighting through the hard times.\n\u0026gt; From a random stack who barely knew eachother, from communication issues to nervousity issues playing on a big stage for the first time, I think we can say we have grown a lot.\n\u0026gt; Thanks for the great leadership Kuro. Thank you for bringing us together, making us a team and not giving up on us when things looked grim.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Also thanks to blitz for helping us in our hard times, sorting our problems out and just being there for us when we needed it.\n\u0026gt; And of course our manager Mo boss.He put so much work into the team, work that is often not even recognised.

{"body":"Just a word of caution when shopping on Amazon for name brands. If the price wayyyy under MSRP, then it may be a knock off. Stay away from Chinese sellers as they usually sell knock off items. If one seller has the same item at 70% off the price of everyone else, then look into the seller before purchasing. This isn't just limited to clothes and shoes. I know for a fact it's a huge issue with other catagories like popular toys and kitchenware.\n\n\nThis is why so many reviews are mixed. Usually it's not the item itself, but one or two bad sellers you should avoid. Unfortunatly most Amazon reviewers don't name the seller in their review so you are left guessing who they bought from. The \"Buy Box\" is almost always occupyed by the seller selling at cheapest price. If unsure if you want to buy from that seller you can always check if other sellers with better seller ratings have the item at a similar price.  \n\n\nA buffer is sticking with Amazon Prime items if you have a subsription so you can take advantage of their returns if you need it.\n\n\nI hope this helps anyone who is unsure if they should buy more expensive items on Amazon and asking themselves if the deal is really too good to be true.","score":"38","subreddit":"femalefashionadvice"}

{"body":"If you read the stuff at the very end Socrates talks pretty clearly about why he doesn't fear death. Quoting from [here](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html):\n\n\u0026gt;Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great reason to hope that death is a good, for one of two things: - either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another. Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by the sight of dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king, will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death is like this, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead are, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again. I, too, shall have a wonderful interest in a place where I can converse with Palamedes, and Ajax the son of Telamon, and other heroes of old, who have suffered death through an unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I think, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs. Above all, I shall be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in that; I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to examine the leader of the great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus or Sisyphus, or numberless others, men and women too! What infinite delight would there be in conversing with them and asking them questions! For in that world they do not put a man to death for this; certainly not. For besides being happier in that world than in this, they will be immortal, if what is said is true. \n\n\u0026gt;Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know this of a truth - that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death. He and his are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own approaching end happened by mere chance. But I see clearly that to die and be released was better for me; and therefore the oracle gave no sign. For which reason also, I am not angry with my accusers, or my condemners; they have done me no harm, although neither of them meant to do me any good; and for this I may gently blame them. \n","score":"18","subreddit":"askphilosophy"}

{"body":"In the case of steam, there are really 3 steam tables you will come across, one of which is obsolete. The obsolete one is the original IFC-67 (created in 1967) often called the \"ASME 1967\" tables. You will probably see this used in older references, which tend to abound in the steam industry. \n\nIn 1997, the IAPWS updated the formulation and created a new steam table, IAPWS-97 which is now the current standard. There is an alternate version of this as well, the IAPWS-IF97, which is the industrial formulation. This version sacrifices a little bit of accuracy, primarily in the region near the critical point and some other less common regions of non-linearity and relative instability. The plus side is that it is a simplified formulation which produces much quicker results and is especially useful in things like performance calculations (CFD for example) where the steam properties may need to be referenced or computed many many times. If you are in the steam industry, IAPWS-IF97 will likely be the standard used.\n\nBut that's specific to the steam industry. Generally speaking there is no 'Bible\" for gas properties. Many of the sources you are looking at probably vary in whether the properties they provide are derived from ideal gas theory, various other equations of state (i.e. Redlich-Kwong) or experimentally measured values. Even for air you can find many different references which make different assumptions (exact chemical composition, relative humidity, etc.) which can give you slightly different values for the same temperature and pressure.\n\nNIST in the US maintains a very large database of properties for many different fluids which is publicly available. This is a good basis to use since it is available to everyone and is regularly maintained. But it's a reference and not standardized in any industry as far as I know.","score":"36","subreddit":"AskEngineers"}

{"body":"Much like Kanye West, Feminism isn't content being *a* social movement, it demands to be **the** social movement.\n\nIt's one part egotism, one part misandry. Some feminists truly and legitimately want to exclude men from even discussing the notion of equality. Others are incensed by the notion that the in-group they're a part of isn't at the top of the pyramid. \n\n\"Intersectional Feminism\", for example, just seems to be a 3rd wave late realization that women's problems had mostly been addressed but race was becoming a hot issue again, so let's keep the name alive and pretend we're egalitarian while wearing the pink crap we already bought. \n\nThe proof is in the pudding. Why else would you actively exclude men from talking about issues that affect them while toting the banner of \"equality\"? Modern Feminism is the embodiment of selective priorities. Men kill themselves at five times the rate women do, infant genital mutilation is still legal (and common!) for males in the West, there are *clear* sentencing biases against men for the same crimes as women... But if you try to talk about any of these issues, you're a \"Men's Rights Activist\" *like it's a bad thing*.\n\nHow is \"BLM\" related to Intersectional Feminism but \"Intactivism\" is not? It's simple, the intent is to exclude men.\n\nEquality is not a zero sum game; raising someone up doesn't lower someone else, but a lot of modern feminists seem to think otherwise and often celebrate when men are emotionally or physically abused. It's disgusting.\n\nPeople like that don't want Egalitarianism. They want reparations, and true equality goes against those goals.","score":"17","subreddit":"Egalitarianism"}

Not only did his party bomb public buildings, killing innocent civilians (he pled guilty to 156 independent acts of public violence), and murder political rivals (often brutally, by burning them alive with gasoline-filled tires around the neck), but Mandela also sought support from brutal regimes like Cuba, Libya, North Korea and Iran. The country has also descended into a social and economic dystopia since his presidency (one-in-three South African women will be raped before the age of eighteen; 37% of South African men admit to having raped someone; rape of infants is a popular practice as a \"cure for AIDS\"; average income of all South Africans has dropped by 40% since 1995; South Africa has fallen 38 places in the HDI since 1994; etc. etc.). Mandela *never* renounced political violence, and he never condemned his terrorist past - Amnesty International refused to identify him as a prisoner of conscience while he was incarcerated. Nelson Mandela's second wife, Winnie, was convicted of the torture and murder of a fourteen year old boy. Nelson Mandela was an absolutely awful human being who committed absolutely unjustifiable atrocities and replaced an unjust regime with an arguably even worse one.\n\n***\n\nIt is perhaps justifiable to resist an unjust regime (I understand an unjust regime to be one which does not even aim in principle to secure the fundamental rights of all of its subjects). But resistance to tyranny doesn't license literally anything: burning children alive or blowing up a church full of innocent civilians is never acceptable, even if you think it can bully or intimidate a population into adopting the \"right\" policies.","score":"-10","subreddit":"PoliticalDiscussion"}

Maine has a long history of supporting third-party and independent candidates, as well as those outside of the mainstream; they're a regular feature of the state's elections. It was one of the states where Perot came in second place in 1992, and one which Al Gore would win in 2000 by a margin of just 5 percent due to the Nader vote. One of their Senators, Angus King, is an independent. Luckily, they're working on this problem: Question 5 on the ballot this year gives the opportunity to support ranked-choice voting.\n\nIt's not an iffy poll, either. SurveyUSA has an excellent track record; Clinton is just doing substantially worse in Maine because she's not the kind of candidate who would do well there, given the state's politics (non-college-educated whites in the 2nd district are probably dragging her down). There isn't a head-to-head, but I suspect it's also because she's losing many voters to the third-party candidates.

He was a two-time Olympian in 1992 and 1996[3] and a gold, silver, and bronze medalist at the Pan American Games in 1995.[6] As a powerlifter, he was WDFPF World Champion (1995)[7] and a two-time U.S. National Champion (1995[8] and 1997[7]) as well as an all-time raw world record holder in the squat and deadlift.[1] ***Currently, he still holds the WDFPF world records in the squat, deadlift and total***[17][18] and the USAPL American record in the deadlift[19][20][21] ***since 1995***. He is credited for ***the biggest raw squat and raw powerlifting total ever performed by a drug tested athlete***, regardless of weight class,[22] as well as the greatest raw deadlift by an American citizen.[19]\n\nEmphasis added, because that's a heck of a long time for a record to stand - 21years!!!\n\n\u0026gt; In weightlifting, Henry was a three-time U.S. National Weightlifting Champion (1993, 1994, 1996),[10] an American Open winner (1992),[13] a two-time U.S. Olympic Festival Champion (1993 and 1994)[1] and a NACAC champion (1996).[6] He holds all three Senior US American weightlifting records of 1993–1997.[23] \n\nYou might be thinking of this:\n\n\u0026gt; In 2002 he won the first annual Arnold Strongman Classic.[6]","score":"16","subreddit":"SquaredCircle"}

Smaller amounts were added to our coffee/bbq/party fund.  If the employee even reported finding it at all, that is.  \n\nI can tell you exactly how this happens, though.  For starters, my coworkers weren't exactly rocket scientists.  My knowledge was pedestrian at best, and they were amazed I knew so much about handbags, antiques, European ceramics, brand name clothes, kitchenware, tools, jewelry, electronics, more- you learn this through life.  Then the management pushes those minimum-wage paid workers to produce- more, hurry, faster, now- through threats, taunts and intimidation.  With that pace, we forgo the little things, like cleaning items, making sure they work, going through stuff and opening every little Altoids tin.  I was yelled at for taking too much time cleaning housewares, while another manager swore at me about how \"fucking filthy\" my stuff was.    And none of them had any real CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, honestly.  How to expedite the process, organize better, use their staff more appropriately with a given day's workload- these concepts were beyond the store level management, who were just tickled to death that now they could walk around all day and threaten to write people up too, and they were just high school drop outs themselves.  My store in particular spent FAR too much time/effort/staffing on clothes, when the extra step of WASHING THEM would do more for them than just being faster and putting more out with higher prices, especially in this day of eBay clothing lots for $.01 and brand new, cheap clothes from Walmart.  And it's in danger of being closed because it's losing money.  Well, bag/lot those casual clothes, focus more on home, furnishing and specialty items, CLEAN THINGS BETTER and make sure your electronics work.  Educate and develop your clueless employees.  My coworkers laughed at me for the little pile of things that I wasted time at home looking up on the computer while they didn't even have internet access.  We weren't allowed the time on shift to look stuff up, you see.  I laughed back as I walked out of that place after buying MAC makeup brushes, brand new high end cosmetics (Philosophy, Clarins, LA MER!!!!), Kindles, Joe's jeans and Keurig machines that were priced ridiculously low because they had no idea of their value. Just yesterday I found AGAIN a brand new Land's End ski coat that retails for $149, priced at $7.99, same as the old, ripped, pleather jacket next to it - it's a women's extra-small, and it's been there ALL SUMMER in this area where it doesn't even snow.  No employee priced that low to buy themselves later. Antique swords and musical instruments get priced  the same as knock-offs and replicas.   Half the store is taken up with clothes like single Charter Club tops which go for $7.99, when I can get tops for $5 on Amazon, and they're pricing used, scratched, dented Contigo travel mugs at $5.99 while I buy them new for the same price at Ross.

We took the message to heart.

And lots of people are just in bad shape, and doing \"2-3 movements max\" before heavy squats isn't going to cut it.\n\nThe issue for me is really that these guys' entire mode of being, their apparent only method of communication, is telling people that they're doing it wrong and that they can fix it.

Bottlenecking is occuring somewhere that was previously optimized pre bm updates. Customization is something that would be loaded into RAM, yet we have multiple times more being loaded (if that's the case) than we did at launch and even then there were scenarios where sub 60Fps would happen. So if you're already at the limits to where 60Fps still occasionally dips, what happens when you add even more assets to be loaded and processed? Like I said, just a theory.

{"body":"I wonder, I'm thinking how they rationalise entirely cold blooded murder, and I've come up with a scenario.\n\nIf they absolutely believe in the afterlife, and the here and now existence of Allah, I imagine it makes sense to kill someone who isn't your precise faith. They're pissing off Allah by not follow the true religion that you follow (Salaft versus other sects). You're \"just sending them to their maker\" in order for him to stop their sinning which they do every day they are the wrong faith, and perhaps put them on the right track in the afterlife.\n\nAt the very least, you've stopped a person insulting Allah and who refuses to renounce their wrong religion, and be a part of your right one. Therefore reducing Allah rage a little, and possibly gaining his favour.\n\nI can see someone who has complete faith, who believes without any doubt, being able to kill someone then. It's not an end, it's a change of matter, a cessation of evil doing, of stopping  heresy.\n\nThey **don't see life and death as separate**.... they see **life and afterlife**... a continuation. They don't see life as a unique and amazing never to happen thing for a person with the intense tragedy of it ending - it's a muddy existence, full of corruption and tests of faith. The afterlife is infinitely better.\n\nThat's why suicide bombers exist.

{"body":"Because ranking favors team plays, rather than individual skill. \n\nOf course you can be extremely good to the point where you can carry a team by taking out enough people,  but in general, a coordinated push with ults will win most every time against a less coordinated team. \n\nI have a friend that used to play competitive CS with his friends, and now they just run a premade 6 man team for competitive Overwatch every time. Even though they don't play much , they are high diamond, simply because they coordinate way more than the enemy team every time. But if you watch their gameplay, they are not like Seagul level skill. They miss plenty of shots, can't really jump in and get multi kills often.  But they move rather slowly as a team and as a result end up dominating quite a bit. \n\nFor example, hereas a team with random players may do stuff like zaria ult followed by pharah which may kill like 3 people, they will take it a level deeper and wait it out.  They will say \"OK, focus rein shield or DVA or zen\", and when those are out, then they will coordinate the zaria ult and end up getting team kills way more.  \n\nThey also do stuff like force the enemy team to trickle in, by hardcore targeting one or two players pushing forward, then pulling back instead of going for more kills. As a result, team fights often result in less players on enemy team fighting while the rest run back. \n\nThey will also switch up comps depending on the team they are playing against, and have strats for every map that they know work well. For example, something that they do on defense that I haven't seen in solo q once is that they will have a winston that will jump back to the first point  to deal with the tracer or genji, while the rest of the team stays at choke. What happens in solo q is that couple of people will fall back to try to stop tracer or genji, which leads to the enemy team gaining a foothold at the choke. \n\nThey will also do shit like coordinate a bastion setup on attack where you have a DVA and Rein that let the bastion deploy without getting fucked and that bastion will melt enough people to let them gain the momentum to take the point or advance the payload. \n\nA lot of the 6 premades that they play against are people that just add each other as friends on Overwatch, and even though there is more coordination there than randos, its much different when you all know each other and know what your strengths are and know before hand what strat you are going to use. \n\nTLDR; Teamwork is OP.

DoMMike didn't like seeing me going 100+-~10 on his server -- he used the Punkbuster drive update excuse to ban me.

{"body":"I'm in the bubble boat but probably have a different experience to others. I came to the conclusion that there's a property bubble in Australia when I moved here 5 years ago. \n\nThe reason I believe that is largely due to analagous conditions I saw in the US leading up to the GFC. Likewise, there's a certain hubris here about the property bubble- for instance, I love to use the fellow at my work who is so confident that property *always* goes up, but shuts his ears when you explain that that's only true in the long run.\n\nI've also met a number of people who's retirement funds lie in real estate or derivative stocks, ETFs, etc.\n\nSo far, my observations only reinforce my idea that a bubble here. If you don't care about the evidence I see, you can skip ahead: \n\n* The emerging glut in apartments in Melbourne (and from what I understand, other capital cities). I don't believe that apartments are a separate market to freestanding houses. For a home buyer, dirt cheap apartments are an alternative to a house and lower prices will, therefore, have some affect on detached house prices. I've seen the general sentiment go from \"All property is a good investment\" to \"Well, detached houses are safe\". No, they're the same market.\n\n* A wilful ignorance that something is amiss- Kinda goes back to my last sentence. People keep coming up with reasons why they're special. First it was \"Australia's different\"- well, not really. Yes, arguments from analogies are imperfect, but we use them because we can't recreate a property bubble in a lab. Plus, being different can be an issue. I recall the argument that people can't walk away from property like they can in the US. Well, if people can't walk away they end up in severe mortgage stress with no way out (including voluntary BK). In a crisis (or at the beginnings of a crisis) that can make problems worse. \n\n* Lost of negative buzz around the finances and economy as it relates to the average person: Employment is down (yes, UE is down as a whole but those are PT and casual jobs decreasing the UE rate. Not sustainable jobs like Aussies are used to), consumer confidence seems to be wavering, interest rates are at record lows (with no correlating change to spending), rental vacancies are up (in apartments) with more blocks in the pipeline.\n\n* Auction rates are sliding, but people say \"Well, that's because we're coming off of a boom that will never be seen again\". Um, two years ago the same people were banging the \"safe as houses\" drum. Also, after every booms usually precede a bust. \n\n* Anecdotally, people seem to forget that a property is only worth what people will pay for it. *Not necessarily* the appraisal value. For instance, there is a house in my neighbourhood that is advertised as a fixer-upper. The expected price? $1.1 million (I'll be interested to see what it goes for).I recall very similar situations in the US, in highly desirable areas that turned out to be duds.\n\nUlitmately, yes I believe Australia (or at the very least, Melbourne and Sydney) are in bubbles. I had the suspicion, and there was no single occurrence that led me to say \"Yep, we're in a bubble\". Likewise, though I see more and more evidence pointing to a bubble and there won't be a single point in time where I say \"Well, I guess there was no bubble\". However, if all (or some) of the things I've listed start to reverse trend then I'll obviously change my tune. But there won't be a single catalyst.\n\nWith all of that, I'll also say that we'll only *know* that a bubble has occurred if it bursts. Now the big question, is how bad do I think a burst would be? I think it would be a blood bath for those heavily leveraged into property (especially those with a number of apartments). For the average person who bought a home to live in? I reckon they can weather the storm but will have to come to grips with the fact that they're locked into an underwater mortgage and that it will take a number of years to recover their losses. As for those who bought to \"get on the ladder\"? Well, I think they'll be waiting for a bit longer than anticipated if they're looking for that upgrade.\n\nTl:dr - I think there's a bubble because prices and sentiment don't marry up with common sense. No one instance led me to believe in a bubble and it's ludicrous to think a single instance will shake that belief. However, evidence can weigh strongly in one way or the other.","score":"33","subreddit":"AusFinance"}

I absolutely love picking up loot. Opening crates and picking up loot are some of my favorite parts of this game. Warframe is a game I can play and complete (for the most part). I loved Diablo and every other dungeon crawler/loot based game. I like farming. I like feeling like the loot matters because I can grab it with my hands(you get what I mean). I used carrier to level it and then set it aside. It took the farm out of a game made for farming. Anyway, I'm not saying your opinion is wrong. As others in this thread have said(who also promptly got down voted...), you do not speak for everyone. You can say it benefits everyone and you see no valid argument against that. I'm proving you wrong. I don't want universal loot simply because it's a big part of why I love this game. If that was gone I would most likely get bored and quit.

{"body":"So in continuation of this, where are Pink Diamond's shards now?\n\n**CRAZY CRACKPOT THEORY PART DOS:**\n\nI do not think Rose Quartz was evil, but she certainly did some questionable things.  When she saw Bismuth was crazy, Rose sealed her away without telling anyone.  Bismuth would exist without knowing the passage of time, so this is an easy way to get rid of Bismuth without imprisoning her, and also without destroying morale for the Crystal Gems.  It wasn't perhaps the right thing to do, but it was the best thing to do.\n\nWe also know that Rose was one to perhaps 'experiment' with life on Earth.  She tended the moss, which bloomed with quartz-like centers.  She managed to actually have/become Steven through Greg.\n\nWhere am I going with this?  What seemingly important character do we see running around, who is attached to Rose and yet whose origins are mysterious?  Who seems to have some intelligence and loyalty to Steven/Rose, but otherwise doesn't care about the affairs on Earth or even the other Crystal Gems?  Who does things their own way until convinced otherwise, but even then, in an almost petulant manner?  Who is pink, has wild hair, and who seems to have some incredible powers that not even other powerful Gems seem to be able to replicate?\n\nI think Lion is the essence of Pink Diamond.  I don't think Lion is necessarily a Gem, but I think he is a kind of Gem without the gem, if that makes sense (unless his Gem is hidden in his mane somewhere).  I think Rose used the shards and essence of Pink Diamond to create Lion, in a way to alleviate her guilt over shattering Pink Diamond - and also as an experiment to see if a Gem/Earthling hybrid would be possible.\n\nWatch Lion's teleportation scene.  The inner portal is diamond-shaped, and while there's blue in it, there's also a lot of pink as well.  Lion's able to drop them off precisely in the Moon Base – but how would Lion know how to get there if he was created by Rose after the war?  It certainly didn't seem like Rose or any of the Crystal Gems had been back there since.  \n\nOne last piece of evidence for this crazy theory...listen to the [Yellow Diamond](http://steven-universe.wikia.com/wiki/Yellow_Diamond_\\(soundtrack\\)) or [Blue Diamond](http://steven-universe.wikia.com/wiki/Blue_Diamond_\\(soundtrack\\)) themes.  Then listen to the *original* [Lion's Mane](http://steven-universe.wikia.com/wiki/Lion%27s_Mane) demo by Jeff Liu.  I don't think Lion was originally meant to be Pink Diamond, but by the time they were making music for \"Lion 3: Straight to Video\", I find it odd that the original demo resembled the Diamond theme so much.  Maybe that's why they changed it.  Or maybe they thought it might be too obvious?\n\nHmm, I don't know!  You can take your tinfoil hats off now, though.

Healthy food options, clean and welcoming spaces, and spacious, green campuses all contribute to the mental and physical wellbeing of students, which is crucial to academic success as well as retention. A depressed student is more likely to withdraw (revenue loss) and perform poorly academically (hurts school prestige and competitiveness in recruitment). \n\nFurthermore, many colleges run conference operations during the summer months, renting out their facilities to interns, academic organizations, sports camps, and professional organizations. The nicer the facilities, the better this mini-business can do, and this serves as a cash-cow profit generator to help defray tuition costs. \n\nNot *every* school operates this way; some definitely make poor investments in campus facilities, and don't leverage them properly. But many schools invest in campus beautification and high quality food because it improves the student experience and allows them to run a for-profit conferencing business in the summer.

{"body":"Hey, thanks for reading.\n\nLet's talk about the 18 y/o thing for a minute.  So, that's the first time I've done that, actually.  In fact, all 3 of the women I mention here are the youngest I've ever slept with.  My ex is 26 if that gives you perspective.  \n\nSo, I've thought a lot about the age limits in the past few weeks, especially when prompted to pick an age range on Tinder.  I'm aware of the half your age plus seven rule, and that seems like a decent guide.  But at the end of the day, it's a pretty arbitrary rule.  The reason it exists is for balance, safety and appropriate behavior between couples.  I think there are definitely instances where sleeping with a much younger girl is unethical and difficult to defend morally.  I'm not trolling for young women at bars or campuses, and I'm not taking advantage of them by getting them drunk or anything like that.  What happens must be very clearly consented to.  Before we had sex, she asked me to fuck her.  I interpret that as she was willing and interested.  \n\nAfter I say what I have to say, if you feel that what I did is unethical, that's your right and I respect that.  But here's my line of thinking…\n\nIn this particular case, we matched.  Meaning, we both \"expressed\" mutual attraction for each other.  I swiped right, and then at some point, she also swiped right.  She then initiated the conversation by reaching out to me.  She is the first, and, so far, only girl who I've hooked up with on Tinder who has reached out first.  Usually I initiate contact.  I took her out to a nice restaurant, we made small talk and got along pretty well.  We both established that we were mature and consenting adults and just went from there.  If I'm honest, she was one of the more mature girls I've dated in the past few weeks, which surprised me actually.  Having said that, there were plenty of areas where it was clear we are fairly far apart age-wise.  I didn't know most of the music she talked about, and she didn't know mine.  We were friendly, but there's no dating material there — too many differences.  I think we're both aware of that.  Neither of us has reached out to each other after that night, but it ended well and we both had fun.  \n\nI always strive to be a gentleman when I take women out.  I also try to be really clear about what I'm after.  Before we met up, I asked her what she wanted out of Tinder and I told her what I wanted and so I gave her an opportunity to let me know if she wasn't into casual sex.  \n\nFrom where I'm standing, yes, she was young.  But, we were both mature about it and we both had a great time.  If you want to arbitrarily pick ages and limit yourself that way, that's fine and I respect that.  After all, it comes down to how much you trust yourself to not take advantage of another person.  I don't think either of us feels like she was taken advantage of.  If she does feel that way, I'll gladly back off.  I'm not sure if I'll contact her again anyway, but we'll see what happens.  \n\nI also do want to point out that I think the age gap thing is a subject that people evolve on over time, especially as they get older.  It's not uncommon for my younger sister to be dating guys in their mid-30's or even older.  I'm not sure why she's attracted to them, but she is, and it's her right to explore her life however she sees fit.  So long as she is smart and not harming herself, I hope she finds what she's looking for.  I think that should be said for everyone, male or female.\n\nI know it's a sensitive subject, and rightly so, but you really just have to use good judgement when interacting with people, sexually or not.  I'm not here to defend myself, because I don't think it's anybody's business except mine and hers, but I did post publicly, so I welcome all thoughts, criticisms, constructive or otherwise.  I think it's a worthwhile conversation to have.  \n\nI just think life is not so black and white, and there is nuance in it.  If you think you might be taking advantage of someone, *don't do it.*  It's never worth hurting another person for temporary satisfaction.\n\nHope that helps a little (thanks for reading my novel) and good luck with your matches!","score":"18","subreddit":"Tinder"}

{"body":"It depends what you mean by \"look happy\". If an animal appears to be smiling, then it's probably not actually happy, because (with a few exceptions) humans are really the only animals who use smiling to indicate happiness (in other primates, a toothy smile usually indicates fear/anxiety). \n\nIf you're referring to exhibiting other animal behaviors that are known to represent positive emotions (like a dog wagging its tail), then you get into the whole complicated discussion of [animal emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_in_animals).

Only a tiny bit of Brown's dna was present but a great deal of dna from a convicted rapist and long time felon was found on the victim. Police said the men acted together. However, no connection between the men was found. \n\nKevin Brown denied having any part in the murder. Until 2014 when Brown was accused, he had never been in trouble and was a happily married man living a middle class existence. His attorney argued that cross contamination was responsible for the dna found on the victims vaginal swab. \n\nThis was well within the realm of possibilities because all of the male employees had brought semen samples for running test experiments to work. The station where the semen samples were processed was directly next to the station where Claire Hough's evidence was processed. Both of these were also directly adjacent to Kevin Brown's work station. All of that occured back in 1984. \n\nKevin Brown committed suicide because of the accusations. His widow is currently suing the city. I firmly believe the dna evidence was incorrect and was the result of contamination in the early days of handling such items.
