The king said fuck it and chugged it down and in a matter of seconds blew up into a million pieces. The wizard commits full on regicide out of nowhere. A few weeks later and after the group talked their way out of being killed on the spot we find ourselves at a border to the other faction.  We threw a grappling hook up into a window of a monstrous border wall and the wizard decides to go first. When he gets through the window he meets a woman who doesn't instantly shriek and call for guards, she tells him that if he goes through her door he will be in for great trouble and if he goes back out the window we'll all most likely be caught and killed. He fails at persuading her for more help and decides that it's time that she died and casts hold person on her and dumps a VERY large paralyzing potion down her throat putting her into full rigomortis-death. Before she dies she lets out a shriek and a guard calls out \"is everything alright, your highness?\".

It doesn't need to ruin the fun of the game.\n\nThis is even more true in this case, as OP's DM presumably didn't even know what RAW was. He was unsure about the RAW and made a call. That's basically the DM's job.\n\nI'm not saying the DM was 100% right and didn't make a mistake.

It's annoying how animations still look like they are from 2001.  Animations are so stiff looking especially online, look at how players die in TF2 vs BF1.  In BF if grenade goes off by players feet, they get fkn sent high into the air flailing limbs- what happens in TF2?  They immediately fall to ground like a stiff sack of potatoes.\n\nCampaign is cool but nothing amazing, AI kinda dumb.  Online is more of the same CoD or tf1 which isn't surprising.  Love the customization and progression are the main reasons I'll come back to this.  Maps are kinda lame but have to be to incorporate the titans.\n\nEverything is improved but seems bleh, I guess as long as CoD and TF1 still use that super old super modified game engine from early 2000 I'll never completely enjoy the game.\n\nThere is nothing that matches the Battlefield One atmosphere, graphics, maps, animations, etc.\n\nI feel like TF2 has same appeal as the first one to me.

Allied + RM'd Castile and Burgundy, picked a couple of Irish minors to diplovassalize along with Navarra because I'm greedy. Forced PU on France via the Maine event. Burgundy wouldn't come but Castile would (and they didn't want land!) so that was easy. \n\nAfter that, Castile was lacking in an heir and was rivalled / same dynasty to Aragon, so when their elderly leader finally died at 65 a succession war fired with me as the defender. I love those, as they involve zero AE. To compensate for the lack of AE, I decided to take all of Aragon that I could handle.\n\nAround this time I noticed Burgundy had a young ruler (~25) with a 1 year old heir with weak claim, so I disinherited 3-4 generations of Yorks and waited heirless, angrily cursing my luck as my ruler lived to be like 68, hoping to get the Burgundian dynasty as heir when he died.\n\nBurgundy calls me into a war with Austria, and then 6 months later my geriatric 68 year old Henry VII finally dies (seriously, all three PUs took so long; I'm pretty sure every leader I needed to die lived to 65+). I'm at war with Austria and let France / Castile do the fighting, then just as Burgundy might be tipping the war I do the honorable thing, break alliance at wartime as soon as their dynasty gets on my throne, and white peace when the war score lets me. This keeps Burgundy at war for another 4 years, draining them for my PU war and also preventing them from finding allies during the 5 year truce caused by my breaking alliance.\n\nI force the PU on Burgundy, which was really annoying due to the AI's tendency to abandon sieges at stage 10 to go save a 1 stack fighting a 3 stack. At this point, Portugal had a 50 year old female ruler and no heir, so I waited until she turned 60 (seriously wtf) and broke alliance and waited. Eventually she croaked, and I got my dynasty as their ruler, and forced PU.\n\nAlong the way I diplovassalized East Frisia because I'm greedy and conquered all of Ireland / Scotland. I took the Norwegian islands and Iceland for colonizing range.\n\nUnfortunately, Castile's elderly 1/1/2 ruler lasted until 65 or so, so they never had enough points to get to the exploration idea. They went religious and diplomatic instead, which is disappointing. However I'm optimistic Portugal can make up for it.\n\nI'm not really sure where to go from here, other than rapidly colonizing and going down Ivory Coast. I could go for Emperor, but I don't have the diplo slots (lol diplo slots) and there are already some big Protestant HRE nations. I'd like to get admin before trying to invade India, because taking 4 years to core a province is killer. I'd also like expansion for maximum colonizing.

That is done with issues that do not include sex directly. In this situation you have made your GF feel uncomfortable with how you want to have sex with her and have triggered her past sexual abuse.

It has been done for years. Walk out of any building and throw a rock and you will probably hit a Carrier VVT system.\n\nEven without a bypass damper, a simple static pressure/discharge temperature system can be installed to override zoning dampers to ensure the primary system is adequately protected.

{"body":"Some men do learn to have multiple orgasms - but many of them learn to have orgasms (high intensity pleasure and pelvic floor contractions) without ejaculating. The first step is strengthening your pelvic floor. Read this too: http://www.nateliason.com/multiple-orgasms-men/ It’s not perfect, but it’s a start…\nAnd this is from my book [The New Sex Bible](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NTF8SMU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;btkr=1): Dry Orgasms\n\nWhile most orgasms are accompanied by ejaculation in men, it is not the sensation of fluid expulsion via spinal reflex that produces the wave of pleasure and release of sexual tension associated with orgasm. These gratifying sensations can actually be enjoyed without ejaculation in an experience often referred to as a dry orgasm. \n\nDry orgasms are sometimes stumbled upon by chance, but some men actually train themselves to enjoy orgasms without ejaculation, as they describe the experience as more intense and they are able to skip the refractory period and experience multiple orgasms in succession. \n\nAs you recall, when male orgasm occurs in conjunction with ejaculation, two set of contractions occur. The first prepares the seminal fluid for expulsion by moving it into the urethral bulb and the second expels the fluid through the urethral opening. After the first set of contractions, most men reach a point of ejaculator inevitability, as the external sphincter opens and the internal one remains close to disallow the release of urine and the flow of semen into the bladder. However, dry orgasms can occur between these two sets of orgasmic contractions resulting in retrograde ejaculation in which semen is redirected into the bladder instead of being ejected through the penis. \n\nAnecdotal reports suggest that not all dry orgasms include retrograde ejaculation, but when they do, your urine may appear more cloudy after sex due to the absorption of semen. For men who learn to have dry orgasms at will, experts have not identified any negative side effects. However, certain medications, surgeries and nerve damage can result in urethral sphincter malfunctioning that leads to non-voluntary retrograde ejaculation. \n\nIf you’d like to explore the possibility of having dry orgasms, the first step is to tone your PC muscle. As this area becomes stronger, you can experiment with several approaches to dry orgasm using your PC muscle:\n\nSqueeze tightly and flex for a few seconds when you feel orgasm is impending. When you release, you may still experience the wave of orgasmic pleasure and involuntary contractions.\n\nWait until you reach the point of ejaculatory inevitability to flex your PC muscle and hold it while breathing deeply until the inclination to ejaculate subsides.\n\nAnother option to experiment with dry orgasms involves a slow technique called Edging. Edging refers to bringing yourself right to the brink of orgasm several times without allowing yourself to go over the edge. Stimulate yourself however you please and stop as soon as you feel as though you are about to climax. Breathe slowly and deeply as you retreat to a less stimulating technique or area until the urge to ejaculate subsides. Repeat this process several times. With practice, some men find that they eventually experience orgasmic sensations without ejaculation during the retreat period.\n\nFrom the book of Gregory, 54.\n\n“For me it’s not really about the dry orgasm. It’s really about the process. By learning to control when and how I come, I actually learned a lot about my own body as a full sexual machine. Now I have sexual and even orgasmic feelings in parts of my body that I never would have dreamed of as sexual. I never thought I’d say this, but it’s actually not all about my cock. Don’t get me wrong, it’s obviously still a central feature, but it’s not the only part that matters.”","score":"642","subreddit":"IAmA"}

However, we do have those emotional centers in our brains just like everyone else, and they can be accessed and used with practice. If you give up and say 'I am unable to perform empathy' without rigorous exercise in emotional connection, then it's like being child learning arithmetic and saying \"I can't do fractions\" and then never trying again. The unfortunate reality of our educational system (in the US) is that no one ever pressures you to work the empathy and sympathy center of your brain, but they will make sure you know how to do arithmetic.","score":"15","subreddit":"INTP"}

But the sites *should* inform their users prior to sharing that the article's information is potentially misleading.  Just some sort of gentle prod to get them to dig deeper, perhaps even - god forbid - read the actual article they're mindlessly sharing.\n\nHell, even just a simple prompt that shows users the article's time stamp and forces them to acknowledge it before sharing would likely cut down on the inundation of old news that gets passed off as current these days.  That one thing alone would do wonders to improving what gets seen on social media, and totally avoids concerns of partisanship altogether.\n\n[edit] Another way to use prompting: have a bot that scans the article for a potential source link.  Way too often, I've seen incendiary doomsday articles written up as a reaction to a more reasonable, down-to-earth piece of reporting from another site.  They invariably have a link to the source article within, and the prompt could say \"would you like to use the source article this one is based on?\" with a direct link that source.","score":"41","subreddit":"tech"}

{"body":"**WARNING: SPOILERS - same level of spoilers as the review itself; my comment mentions the names and mechanics of certain enemy types encountered in the Dark Souls 3: Ashes of Ariandel DLC.**\n\n\nFound myself agreeing with basically every point, especially about the lack of content, over-reliance on giant health pools, mob fights and ambushes, and the bloodborne-like enemies feeling like a symptom of running out of ideas. Though I really liked the visual and mechanical design of the wolves, the crow warriors and Friede herself, they definitely felt like they fit more into Bloodborne's world than Souls. Their mobbing, long combo chains and quick dashes made me feel slow in comparison, and made them feel out of place. \n\n\nThe difficulty is another point; I didn't find most of the parts 'challenging' as much as 'tedious', which is how I felt with some parts of DS2. A lot of the encounters feel more like From throwing everything and the kitchen sink at us in an attempt to 'challenge' us or deprive us of some estus, instead of cleverly or smartly designed encounters that bring something new to the table. The biggest difference is that a lot of these encounters are more about patience than mastery. \n\n\nObviously, it's too much to expect consistent, repeated genius and novelty with a series that's essentially on its 5th iteration. For what it's worth, AoA has a lot going for it. The visuals were incredible, Friede is clearly a fan-favorite and very deserving of it. The fight is atmospheric, mechanically challenging, and audiovisually gorgeous. At the end of it though, once the excitement is over, it's difficult not to get the 'that's it?' feeling. It's not even about getting my money's worth, more a comparison to my expectations that the series has set up so far, especially with Artorias and Old Hunters. \n\n\nIn the end, I'm still happy with the purchase, and I'm not sure if it was 'kept back' to be sold separately, or is 'blatantly disrespecting' the fanbase; while this is certainly a possibility, it would probably be the most cynical way of looking at it. I tend to lean on thinking of it as, like I said before, a sign that From is beginning to run out of new ideas, and/or that Miyazaki is ready to move on from the series - which is something he's been hinting at pretty consistently for a while now.

{"body":"There's a lot of shorter, demo-like experiences for VR, but the reputation that VR in general seems to get about not having any fleshed-out games isn't true, imo.\n\nCheck out games already out like Chronos, Edge of Nowhere, Blazerush, Lucky's Tale, The Assembly, Damaged Core, Eve: Valkyrie, Feral Rites, Dragon Front, Fated: A Silent Oath, Onward, or Vanishing Realms.\n\nBigger-budget games coming out in the next few months include Arktika.1, Lone Echo, Landfall, Dead and Buried, Robo Recall, and Superhot.\n\nPlus, something big that's often overlooked, is the fact that there are a bunch of high-quality, pre-existing games out there that have gotten quality VR support. Games like Minecraft, Euro \u0026amp;amp; American Truck Simulator, Project Cars, Dirt: Rally, Assetto Corsa, Elite Dangerous, War Thunder, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Subnautica, Adr1ft, Obduction, and supposedly Fallout 4 down the road among others.  I'd personally argue that some of these games are killer apps in themselves.  Especially for the cockpit games — there's absolutely no going back to 2D once you've driven or piloted in VR.\n\nTo add on to that, emulators like Dolphin have been modded to work very well with VR.  Ever wonder what it's like it play Wind Waker in VR, or play some multiplayer SSB in a VR LAN party?\n\nThe Rift and Vive have been out for all of 7 months.  That's a pretty good library by my measure, compared with your average new console or handheld launch. \n\nYes, there are plenty of tech demos, and sure, there isn't a plethora of AAA \"killer apps\" made natively for VR yet.

In every single match, every player has access to all the same weapons, champions and such and it's a matter of which team plays better.\n\nAlso, unlike in many other games where gambling is the only way to obtain some virtual items, in CS:GO/DOTA/TF2 you can choose to buy them from the Steam Marketplace for a listed price instead.\n\nIf anything, I think Valve is setting a good example for highly profitable, yet fair micro-transaction model. This is how it should work in every game.\n\nGames like Rocket League *sort of* get there, but the lack of proper in-game marketplace or steam marketplace integration makes it a hassle that's prone to scamming if someone desires to buy items directly (e.g. buy keys, wait for a week, look for someone trading the item you want online for an acceptable price - instead of just searching on market and clicking buy)\n\nI don't care if they sell StatTrak slippers for $10K, but selling any kind of temporary or permanent advantage over other players is the recipe to make any multiplayer game hot garbage.","score":"18","subreddit":"Games"}

At one time, I think it would have been extremely well received. If it came out ten years ago it probably would be considered a classic along with shows like FLCL, but given today's audience and industry, it doesn't really fit into the mold of the shows that are generally well received, which is a shame. Even among shows that have come out in recent years with similar out-of-the-box aesthetics and levels of batshit crazy (like Kill la Kill, for example), Flip Flappers is in on a completely different level. I love weird shit like FLCL and Kill la Kill, but I've never seen anything quite like this. I completely passed it by for the first week or two until someone here told me it was kinda like FLCL, one of my favorite shows, otherwise I would have missed it too.

So anyways I am trying to use this pass as much as I can, staying in all sorts of weird places and I end up seeing a flyer for a town called Hida, and decide to go on a whim. Its a beautiful town, and I go to a cafe where I meet a woman who has a niece starting school in the fall at the same college as me, mind you I go to a tiny ass school in the US, and this person LIVES in a town so small that the station actually combines the names of the two closest towns Hida-Furukawa. \n\nAnyways two months later I go to see Kimi no Na Ha in theaters and things start looking really familiar, until I see the ACTUAL STATION THAT I GOT OFF AT! It was pretty crazy realizing that as I was watching the movie.\n\nAnyways the place is magical but if I remember correctly in the film Hida ended up being less important that either Takayama or Tateyama (can't really remember) but they are all beautiful places.

(I've never attended an actual draw so wouldn't know if this is exactly how it goes, but the skaters themselves draw their numbers.) For the free program, the skating order is usually reverse placements, or randomized within warm-up groups.\n* Warm-up, for those who have maybe not watched real skating: in competitions, skaters are divided into warm-up groups of six or fewer skaters. Every group has a warm-up time of six minutes on ice, then they leave the ice, and take their turns skating. Rinse and repeat for other groups, usually with an ice surfacing break every two groups.\n* Minami and his \"Axel of three million GOE\": Grade of Execution, a value from -3 to 3 given to every element based on how well it was executed.\n* Yes, skaters do occasionally skate (or jump...) into the boards, even in competition.

And when you get into the lack of oversight for Sheriffs, it is truly terrifying.  Because they control the information that voters are able to have in order to elect a Sheriff.  They have no other check on their power.  So if their department rates suck, or if they botched up an investigation, they just have to hide that from the public. And they can do that by not closing a case even when an arrest is made because the public/journalists cannot get the files of open cases.  \n\nSo ultimately it depends on where you live and if you are lucky enough to live in an area with a decent police.  Because there is no unified system of tracking bad police departments and no governmental oversight into who is failing.  \n\nSorry for the rant, I just finished listening to the [Into The Dark podcast](http://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark) (highly recommend, it is about much more than the original crime) which goes into detail the helplessness the average citizen has if they just happened to live with shitty police.

There is just no good reason an infinity stone should overrule the physics of *another dimension*. A personal nitpick, but I also hate the concept of something being \"beyond time\". If they are affected by causality, like Dormammu obviously was, if for nothing else than his previous interactions with this universe, he should have a complete understanding of time.\n\nLastly, the humor was probably the most forced of all of Marvel's movies so far, and all of it fell flat.\n\n*edited out a spoiler","score":"94","subreddit":"movies"}

The entire movie portrayed them as incoherent, screaming beasts. If they were to have used the actual book and made the infected more like vampires that were trying to create a society, then the alternate ending would make so much more sense.

Dr. Strange had zero parallels to Christianity except for a \"good vs evil\" storyline, which isn't even a Christian thing. It predates Christianity and it predates monotheism. \n\nMaybe the idea of an eternal realm (like heaven or hell) got people to think they were talking \"deeper\" with a religious tone. I didn't get that at all. Especially because we see a multiverse (which isnt monotheism or any religion we westerners practice) and we see the \"dark dimension\" which is this lifeless place where a giant face dwells. Lol. Okay. That has nothing to do with any religion. The ONLY \"philosophical\" argument they had in the movie was when Strange was arguing with the Elder Sorceress about the natural world vs the spirit world. Kinda a knock at the whole science vs faith/belief debate that seems to only be held in the States.\n\nSo, maybe to cultural Christians the movie had a extremely short and tiny debate about science vs faith, but to everyone else who saw the movie, it was really just a typical comic book/fantasy-style storyline.

{"body":"It was quite odd growing up in that environment. I spent most of my life in Qatar (which although a *hell* of a lot more liberal than most, is still under Sharia Law) and honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal.\n\nFirstly, there are a *lot* of gay Muslims and Arabs, go figure. However, there are also a lot that simply participate in 'gay activities.' That's a weird sentence, but you get a very clear 'nature vs nurture' vibe in that environment.\n\nGay people are obviously born gay, but at the same time, these young boys are ostracized from girls, not even being able to see or speak to them a lot. Go to all boy schools, not allowed interaction with anyone that isn't a boy. Funnily enough, when they reach puberty, they start experimenting, and when there aren't any girls around? You get the idea.\n\nThat makes it odd because they all know and are aware that it exists quite commonly in their own culture, but... I don't know, refuse to admit it? It's like the 'not my son, my son would *never* misbehave' parents. There's a great deal of denial.\n\nIn my experience, I never saw the outright danger of it (but those gay people I knew weren't dumb enough to flirt with the dangers, in fairness), but I did see the general blase attitude of people not really thinking about it much, as the guy above mentioned.\n\nIt's not a big deal until it is a big deal, is kind of the situation I experienced. Nobody cares until A - they are expected to care, or B - get angry with the person. 'Yeah well what does his opinion matter, he's just a gayboy,' is the sort of thing you might here in passing. Only when there is significant attention do people start going 'hey, you're bad and wrong and I hate you!'\n\nI as certainly around the more tolerant in the country, though. Some of my closest friends there were openly gay, one person I went to school with was a stereotypical gay (the voice, the walk, the clothes) and even he wasn't really harassed. I genuinely get the whole 'oh shit, the Big Guy Upstairs might be watching, time to put on my piety cap!' vibe. Earns them a couple heaven points to bash homosexuality when people are looking, then return to not caring the rest of the time.","score":"15","subreddit":"soccer"}

{"body":"Jag är väldigt sparsam av mig men när det kommer till livsmedel så är det i det stora hela ICA och City Gross som gäller, med undantag från vissa rabatter hos övriga butiker, t ex om det är billiga apelsiner på Willys. Anledningen är att jag bryr mig om helhetskänslan i butiken vad gäller t ex atmosfär och kundbemötande, som jag upplever är nämnvärt bättre på ICA, samt att ICAs egna varor och ICA Basic slår Coops egna sortiment med hästlängder. City Gross Favorit och Budget har vissa produkter som är okej, men mycket är ren skit. Sen när jag har ICA-kort så blir det att jag väljer en ICA-butik för att få pengar tillbaka på allt jag handlar, även om jag inser att det inte alltid lönar sig. Jag har inte upplevt att Coop Forum är billigare i helhet än ICA Maxi. Däremot har jag erfarenhet av att få slänga nyinköpta produkter från Coops egna sortiment för att de inte går att äta ens för en allätare som jag. Som yrkesperson har jag också fått uppfattningen under mitt senaste år som livsmedelsdistributör att personal på ICA är mycket trevligare och hjälpsam än personalen på Coop. Coops personal är mer benägen att stå med händerna i fickorna och se på när jag lossar deras jävla gods för att sedan klaga när man ställt det \"fel\" i kylen. Medan ICA närmast alltid sträcker fram en hand. Men det skiljer sig naturligtvis från butik till butik och vissa områden är värre än andra.\n\nDet är bara min erfarenhet och min åsikt. ICA står så vitt jag förstått för halva marknaden, och stora bolag får alltid folk emot sig. Det är ju bra att det finns olika butiker så att andra kan välja Coop/Willys/Lidl/Hemköp.","score":"15","subreddit":"sweden"}

Vården och skolan lider av systematiska problem utöver invandringen. Brottslighet hade funnits utan invandring. Polisen hade lidit av illa hanterade omstruktureringar och personalbrist även utan invandring. Det är helt möjligt att alla dessa problem har förvärrats av invandring, men att låtsas som att precis alla samhällets skavanker enbart är på grund av MENA-invandrare är bara att grovt förenkla situationen.\n\n\u0026gt;Även om SD fick 100% egen majoritet att styra och ställa precis de ville tror jag de skulle misslyckas kapitalt med att lösa några av de problem sverige står inför. Man hade fumlat med populistiska handvändningar och förbud som orsakat tumult och problem, kanske lyckats stoppa den omedelbara asylinvandringen och anhöriginvandringen, men sen bara gjort existerande integration värre.\nPartiet består av antingen ideologiska rasister (fornlämningar från BSS-rörelsen) eller inkompetenta karriärpolitiker.

He was not content with being one of the most powerful beings in the galaxy, but he needed even more admiration as well. His foil, Dorn, asked for none, and this is what I find admirable. And guess what? Perturabo is still the one better off, since he is a Daemon Prince, whereas Dorn has a half-dead father that he tried so hard to protect, and is probably dead himself. So why I should be piting him?\nMagnus got screwed hard by the hateful Rout at the onset of Heresy, but he had a choice hitherto. And he got a warning, before he maneuvered himself into a dead end.\nLorgar, Mortarion and Alpharius(\u0026amp;Omegon) all rebelled willingly.\n\nIt seems it is easy to forget that loyalist Primarchs suffered great losses themselves. Sanguinius and Ferrus Manus died for the Imperium, Vulkan went mad from Curze's 'hospitality', and all of them had their own sons slaughtered in a massive civil war (Corax' legion almost went extinct on the start of the Heresy) and ended up in much weaker position (either dead, in coma or missing) than surviving traitors. I find more interest and respect for those who while great by themselves, recognized that are not the center of the universe and chose to make sacrifices for the sake of humanity, rather than for personal vanity. Some Primarchs had no real choice in betrayal (which I enumerated at the beginning), but I do not empathise with the rest.\n\nLastly: why is there so much slander about The Lion? The one Primarch that never wavered in loyalty, and who was the most opposed to Chaos, to be equaled with guys that spread solely murder, care only for the glory, or are just psychopathic? Seriously. He was not a great guy to be around, but not everybody is a smooth-talking extrovert. It is a miracle in itself that he learned how to be a social person at all, after ten years he spent alone in the nightmarish forests of Caliban. The Fallen are the traitors, whereas Lion fought his foster father - the champion of Chaos - destroyed his tainted homeworld, and almost got killed over it. And he is the \"most vile\".

Buy back shares\n\n...all with the goal of increasing EPS, whether it is long-term or short-term -- organically or \"artificially\" (through buybacks, though people will debate on this). Public companies need to use dry powder or their capacity of dry powder for something if it is feasible, or else they're not doing their job. It's certainly not fraud, and almost certainly not a bubble. \n\nThis is good for a student's opinion piece but you seem extraordinarily confident in your views. You are correct that firms want to do whatever they can with leverage now due to the opportunity cost of waiting until the future when rates will be rising, but that isn't necessarily the main reason for the DJIA not being an accurate indication of economic performance.

You do not learn fundamentals that you should know if you want to even just be competent.\n\n* With a math degree, you don't just have a solid mentality to tackle programming, you also have options if you find out you do not enjoy programming. This makes you useful/valuable for an employer... a lot more than just being like one of those copy/paste code monkeys in /r/programming.\n\n* By self-studying, you'll learn one of the most important skills -- How to learn on your own. You never stop learning when you are a programmer. As \"ideological\" as it sounds, it's more of a way of life.  This is something a lot of people seem to not understand, until their skills are deprecated and they aren't hirable anymore. \n\n* After you have the basics down, find out that you're interested in X field and Y field, build your toolbox around that. Always learn some sysAdmin skills (bash or shell, depending on whether you expect to be working with *nix or Windows).\n\nAnd that's really all I'm willing to put out there. Good luck with your goals, friend. Hopefully, this isn't going to tilt someone off the face of the earth as it usually does when I criticize anything popular.

Other characters got their arcs advanced as well, such as the implication that Wally will become a huge hero in the future, and Beast Boy being able to be disarmed by Tim Drake's image, though i AM a bit worried that missing Tim will be his only character trait. The only part of the issue that I didn't like was when the Titans thought Damien had left them behind, because that felt like a needless moment of \"tension\" in a book called \"Teen Titans\". \n\nOverall I really wish this was bi-monthly, seeing as how it's the only place to see Beast Boy and Starfire since Raven has her own series and Wally and Damien are showing up in the Flash and Superman respectively.

{"body":"There is a very long and (surprisingly mild) debate going on about this over on Oro Jackson.\n\nIt boils down to this (and it's kind of long):\n\nLots of people are hyped about Smoothie and her bounty. And just 'her' in general. Lots of assumptions are being made about her, and while many of them are probably true (being very strong, having great haki, etc), it's becoming a matter of \"we really don't know anything\".\n\nWe don't know her personality. We don't know if she's susceptible to hypnosis or manipulation. She could be lacking in intelligence, or a brilliant strategist. She could depend on her Devil Fruit, or she might be a swordsman on Zoro's calibre. She might even be extremely lazy.\n\nLikewise, we don't even know what Brook can do. He might unlock Haki this arc. He's done nothing but one-shot New World generals of unknown strength/power, and freak out over Kinemon's \"ghost\". And rescue other Straw Hats. We've seen next to nothing of his capabilities.\n\nWhat we do know, is that Brook is a master manipulator. Even when he's not playing his music, he exploited Jora's weakness (her hubris over art) and cut her at her weakest point. Then when he plays music, he can make people hallucinate, fall asleep and God knows what else. Seeing he promised a 'concert', I imagine what he has in mind involves music when entering the treasury room.\n\nI would not discount Brook from being able to hold his own against an opponent even as daunting as Smoothie. With our limited knowledge now, I don't see him winning a fight with her--short of him getting close enough to Yahazu Giri her weakest point. But that tactic likely won't work on someone with advanced CoO, or a Yonko commander's level of expertise.\n\nThere's not enough data.

But it's not too late for the rest of our public lands.\n\nFirst step is for people to actually grasp the difference between management agencies. I've heard people describe this as selling off a state park or a national park, or forest, or any combination of terms. Words have meaning, and each of those agencies have different goals. We need to be clear if we're going to get anywhere.\n\nNational Forest mandates mixed use, and has to set management plans that balance recreation, wildlife/habitat conservation, and commercial use (timber, mushrooms, etc). \n\nState Forest is a timber reserve. That's it. So if federal land gets shifted to state control, things will be wildly different. Trail heads and roads will not be maintained or the public, harvest will be aggressive, and it'll still probably get sold off to private, multinational companies who will gate everything and prohibit or charge for access. We need to make this super, super clear for people and defend federal lands aggressively.\n\nThis is where the hikers, birdwatchers, hunters, yuppies, hippies, and rednecks all need to come together. I'm not sure people fully appreciate how good we have it with federal public land right now. \n\nSide note, I also think we shouldn't get up in arms every time the USFS proposes any type of timber cutting (looking at you, Portland). Some thinning can be beneficial in certain areas, especially fuels reduction for preventing catastrophic wildfires. And a certain amount of sustainable harvest keeps a few rural jobs and can take some of the wind out of the pro-transfer side's sails.

{"body":"**The Big Short (2015)**\n\nWho knew that Adam McKay could direct a movie this well? After movies like Anchorman, Step Brothers, etc. most people (myself included) had written him off as someone who can competently direct comedies but that was about it. This movie proved me wrong. The editing in this movie is incredible and fits the story so well. It is like a character. McKay managed to condense an incredibly complex economic crash into a entertaining and emotional movie that remains one of the better films of last year. 9/10\n\n**Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition (2016)**\n\nI was someone who really did not like the theatrical version of BvS. I hated it actually. After seeing this version I have to wonder why they did not release this in theaters instead of the shitty theatrical cut. The plot makes a lot more sense in the ultimate edition as we are given enough time to understand why certain things happen. We learn how Lex Luther framed Superman for the killings in the desert, why people were being murdered in prison over the bat brand, gave some more time to Clark's investigation into the Batman, etc. Also many dialogue scenes were extended, allowing the characters to be fleshed out more. The movie also feels much less awkward and the editing between scenes is not atrocious anymore. However, all these improvements are not enough to save the film. Lex Luther still acts like a hyperactive cartoon, Lois is still a walking plot device, Batman and Superman are both hypocrites for hating each other for doing the exact same thing they do, there is still a bunch of awkwardly written scenes with horrible dialogue at times, \"save Martha\" is still a thing and the third act still includes a ninja turtle on meth destroying the city with really bad CGI. The movie has so many deep and philosophical ideas, great performances from Affleck and Cavil, and some great action set-pieces, but it is all undercut. The film has so many great ideas but because of mediocre execution the ultimate edition of BvS only comes off as half-baked, though better than the theatrical. 5/10, theatrical cut gets a 3/10.\n\n**Arrival (2016)** \n\nDenis Villeneuve is one of my favorite working directors (having previously done Prisoners, Enemy and Sicario), and this is my new favorite film of his. Arrival is what Interstellar wanted to be. Subtle, philosophical, and incredibly emotional towards the end, this easily takes the top spot on my best of the year list. It moves along at a slow pace, but Denis' phenomenal direction, some jaw-dropping beautiful shots, a creepy and tense soundtrack and Denis' trademark sense of tension keep the film engaging until the third act when things start happening quicker and all the puzzle pieces start falling into place. Every actor here is on the top of their game, but I think this might be the best performance of Amy Adams career. The end message of this film, though I won't spoil it, was surprisingly heartwarming given how cynical Villeneuve's last few films were. I immediately wanted to see this again, and I plan on going again later today. Any more discussion of this movie would result in spoilers so I leave this with my highest possible recommendations, it is the years best and one of the decades best. 10/10. \n\n**The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)**\nThis is a re-watch of one of my all-time favorite movies, and Wes Anderson's best film in my opinion. Each character has their own quirky characteristics which are meticulously planned out and planted throughout the entire film, and each actor does an incredible job, especially Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, and Gwyneth Paltrow. As per usual with Anderson's films, it is visually gorgeous and also subtly hilarious. What I think sets this apart from the rest of Anderson's work is that I think this is his film with the greatest emotional payoff. The Needle in the Hay scene is heartbreaking to watch every single time, and the slow buildup to Ben Stiller saying \"We've had a hard year dad\" never loses its impact. In fact, it makes me tear up every time I see it. This is a film about family and forgiveness, and if you have not seen it I can't recommend it enough. 10/10.","score":"20","subreddit":"TrueFilm"}

We'll go based on last season's production (which is favorable to Bryant because he has never achieved that level of production before, while Trout has shown he is capable replicating the type of season he had in 2016). Trout was worth 2.9 more rWAR than Bryant last season. 2.9x$7.5M=$21.75M. Trout will make $20,083,000 next year. It's a good bet he'll be more valuable than Bryant next year. \n\nHis salary jumps to $34M for the remainder of his contract after that. Bryant's will go up an unknown amount in arb as well. He may very well provide more per dollar value than Trout for his first year of arbitration. The second year could go either way. For his final year, it's highly unlikely, based on their current production and Donaldson's arb figures which you mentioned ($17M for his final year), that Bryant is worth more. Also, Trout's salary is locked in. The amount awarded in arbitration is continually rising and Bryant will be a former league MVP going through the process.\n\nAnd again, this is all predicated on each player maintaining their current production. Trout has proven that is not an unreasonable expectation for him. We don't know how consistent Bryant will be.\n\nSo the Cubs would absolutely not refuse a straight up trade.","score":"-5","subreddit":"baseball"}

{"body":"The Bayern board not wanting to spend money is going to screw Bayern over in the future. They need to understand that transfers are changing, so in order to bring world class players to the club, we're going to have to spend some money.\n\nFor example, we had the opportunity to bring De Bruyne here, but instead of paying what Wolfsburg wanted the board said no and now he's at city, and is one of the best playmakers in the world. Another example is Sané, I think its was pretty obvious the board wanted him at Bayern, but instead of buying him this summer we were going to wait a whole year to activate his release clause so he could be a little bit cheaper, and now he's at city. We're letting these good players, go to these good teams because the board doesn't want to spend the necessary amount to get them. Now there a bunch of rumors that we're going after Serge Gnabry next summer, and while he has had a good start to the season he's not someone that could solve problems now. Gnabry is still young, and we need a world class player that could change the game when asked upon. I also saw rumors that we're interested in Julian Brandt but instead of buying him next summer, the board is going to wait for the summer of 2019 because apparently that is when his release clause activates. Who knows if he's still going to be at Leverkusen in 2019.\n\nThe board would rather get a lesser player for cheap, rather than the world class option. Thats not always a bad decision, but if we have the opportunity then we need to go for the more expensive route. I'm not saying we need to brake the transfer record every summer, but looking for the cheap option, the release clause, or the player who's going to run down their contract isn't going to work anymore.\n\nThis past summer we made horrible transfers. While I think Renato is one of the best young players in the world, he wasn't necessary. The board should have bought a backup striker, cb, and rb. Its shocking to me that we would go into this season with all these injury prone players and not buy backups. Lewandowski hasn't been that good recently, but we cant bench him because there's no one to replace him.","score":"17","subreddit":"fcbayern"}

{"body":"Disclaimer: I'm no fan of Trump, and won't be supporting him next week. However, I feel that the implication of this headline and article is not totally fair to Trump and will likely be misinterpreted and/or blown out of proportion by /r/politics. I don't expect this to be upvoted like the anti-Trump comments on this post, but oh well.\n\nTrump quotes on LiButti from the article. First from 2016:\n\n\u0026gt; During the years I very successfully ran the casino business, I knew many high rollers. I assume Mr. LiButti was one of them, but I don't recognize the name.\n\nand another from _1991_, long before this election:\n\n\u0026gt; I have heard [LiButti] is a high roller, but if he was standing here in front of me, I wouldn't know what he looked like.\n\nI think these Trump quotes are relevant. The video shows Trump and LiButti standing by their adjacent seats at a Wrestlemania event. It's not like it's a video of them having dinner or a business meeting together.\n\nFrom the limited evidence presented, I think it's unfair to say \"Trump definitely knew this guy well and this video proves he's lying.\" It's totally plausible that Trump was aware of LiButti's existence (as the above quotes suggest) but didn't have any meaningful relationship with the guy. The fact that they had adjacent, prominent seats at a public event isn't particularly damning. That logic suggests that every pair of celebrities and/or rich people you see sitting next to each other courtside at NBA games and similar events know each other well, which is obviously not remotely true.\n\nIf I had to guess, Trump knew this guy and is downplaying their relationship. But I'm not convinced he is outright lying, and I don't think this new video really means anything. Of course the optics are not good, but I don't think that's what people should be focusing on.\n\n**Edit:** I've gotten some tremendous feedback on my comment above, and I feel it's important to add more detail. To sum up the above, I think it's unfair that the article ran with the video evidence as the focus of the story, because I don't think the video proves very much, regardless of whatever other evidence exists. I think it's an unfair attention-grabber, and I fear that is why it's the top post on /r/politics. _However_, I do think the article contains some useful information, most notably that LiButti's daugher alleges that her family were Trump's guests at the Wrestlemania event; that is, he invited them and thus knew them. I think _that_ should have been the focus of this article and _that_ should have been the headline, something like \"Daughter of mob-connected LiButti claims Trump knew him\" (I'm no headline writer). Maybe that story would get fewer clicks, but it's more fair and relevant to the story. The video should have been mentioned in the article (oh by the way here's some footage that at least shows they were at the same event) but it should not have been the focus. To be honest, I think part of the reason that the video is the focus is because of the 30-second ad that plays before it. That makes the website more money than banner ads.\n","score":"113","subreddit":"politics"}

{"body":"When I was a private contractor, I usually would spend several thousand dollars a year on professional 'stuff' - computers for labs, legal copies of software, training...  it was all part of how I made a living - just a cost of doing business.  If someone was going to be paying me $40,000 a year to integrate a feet of Macs with their Active Directory, I'm sure as shit going to have a Mac or two lying around to learn on.\n\nThese days I spend much less.  I work full time for an organization for a slightly below what I would make in the private sector.  However, part of the deal is I expense everything.  Buy a used firewall or router for a lab?  Expense it.  Buy VIRL to practice for a CCNP recert?  Expense it.  Buy a CBT subscription?  Expense it.  The only thing I pay for out of my own pocket these days is a personal laptop, just to keep work and my own life separate.\n\nIf I was a bit further back in my career, or if I had to start at someplace new for some reason, I wouldn't feel at all put out to buy some of that for myself.  Sure, I might be stuck at a shitty MSP that wants a bazillion billable hours each month, and won't pay for any training, and hooks my pager up to a live feed to the SQL server that crashes every Monday morning at 3:00am but I'm not going to be able to land anything better if I don't keep up my skills, or learn something new.\n\nI think the biggest expense I forked out for was my masters degree.  That was about $17,000.  It was a personal goal to get that, and I had a great opportunity at my university.  Sadly, it doesn't directly translate into my job, but I figure it will always look pretty on my resume if I ever have to go anywhere...\n\n/u/crankysysadmin has a nice post in here today with some thoughts for junior SAs, the first being what you should reasonably spend your own resources working on.  Give that a read.\n\nThere is also quite a lot of free stuff out there.  Microsoft has some great labs you can work on, all of which are free.  There are great YouTube series' out there, and some free ebooks for different certs.  Spend time learning the details of whatever you want to master (eg: the default refresh time for group policy in an AD environment; per port spanning tree values in your switch; how packet queueing in your firewall works).  Over time this will make you a valuable resource for your department - you can be the go-to person for a particular technology.\n\nIf you have some money to spend, look at buying some stuff for a home lab for whatever technology you want to master.  Get a big PC that can run VMWare / Hyper-V and run a simulation of something (eg: Configuration Manager).  Get a subscription to MSDN so you can download all the software, or run simulations in Azure.  Cisco has a similar service if you want to become a CallManager nerd.  There's lots of very cool stuff out there you can buy for not a lot of money.  Bonus points if you can get yourself an academic email address somewhere and get the student discount.  \n\nAt the end of the day, humans learn best by doing.  You can read all the books in the world about Configuration Manager, but if you've never set the damn thing up from scratch, you're probably missing some of the pieces.  Install it, set it up, break it, figure out how to fix it, and then break it again.  Back it up, blow away your VMs and restore it.  About to deploy a new component of it for a client?  Do it up in your lab, even if you aren't the engineer deploying the feature.  When you get the call on the helpdesk, you'll know what logs to look at, and how long certain features take to get propagated to the end stations.\n\nAnyway, not sure if that directly answers your question, but there you go.  Practice lots on your own time so you can become a valuable resource at work.  Even if you only practice on the free labs, or just use some old kit at work.  After a while you might find that you start to get paid to do this.  We need to set up a greenfield Config Manager 2016 environment?

Beyond the obvious embarrassment of being a moron, I had to spend the rest of the trip to D.C. holding the window shut. Sleeping became much more complicated as well. Oh, and as I was holding that big, stupid window shut, freezing my head off from the cool night breeze, I got a front row seat to my crush and some cool guy flirting for the remainder of the drive. \n\nTL;DR: Opened a bus window that shouldn't have been opened; was an imbecile.

{"body":"A little background...\n\nThis happened in February of 2015 with a girl that was in my \"best friend\" category. I was in a relationship with my current girlfriend and she knew that. I was 21 and in college. \n\nSo...\n\nIt was about 2/2:15am and I was inviting people over to my apartment for an after party (closing time was 2 in my county) and this girl was the only one coming over. \n\nAt the time my girlfriend had moved out of state for work so it was a little off that it would be just a girl and myself in my apartment while I was already hammered, but, like I said, she was one of my really good friends and I was drunk so I didn't see much wrong. \n\nShe had said something about 6 months before that about liking me, but we had chalked it up as a crush that fizzled out. \n\nShe drove over to my place where I continued to drink and she had one for herself as well. We were just chilling in the living room and watching a movie since no one else showed up and then she was just kissing me. I have made my feelings to her clear before that I wasn't interested in her, but it was like I couldn't control my actions. It was an out of body experience that was fuzzy and disconnected at best the next morning. \n\nThe worst part is feeling like it's your fault the next morning. Y'all read everything above, I put myself in the situation, how could I not think it was my fault? I thought that it was just a drunken night and the only thing I wanted to do was forget it. \n\nThe first person I told was my other really good friend and also a mutual friend between me and the girl. That's when shit hit the fan...\n\nI was being told that the girl remembered absolutely everything and was making advancements on me, later I found out that she actually was making a backstory to make it seem like my fault. She said I was feeding her drinks and I was the one coming on to her. It was a really depressing experience. \n\nPoint is, if it ever happens to you, feeling guilty is normal and the best thing to do is let some friends know and let them help you. It still affects me today, but I was lucky that it wasn't violent in anyway and that I had friends to help. \n\nSorry this was so disorganized, it was a littler hard to write.

When I say \"a bit,\" I mean \"off the deep end.\"  For context, this was the mid-80's.\n\nSuddenly, cartoons were evil.  I couldn't watch He-Man, Voltron, Richie Rich, Tom \u0026amp; Jerry.  Nothing!  She could see evil in anything. Smurfs taught homosexuality. He-Man taught witchcraft. Richie Rich taught greed.  And so on...  Magazines were evil too. I was at the age where driving was in sight, so I had various car magazines coming to the house. Not anymore!  Why?  Because the sexy bikini-laden car models taught \"hyper sexuality\" and it would turn me into a rapist. Don't even get me started on video games either. I was only allowed to play religious video games and watch religious cartoons. Also, no TV in my room anymore because if I was left alone with a TV, I'd end up being influenced into being a gay, murdering, Satan-worshipping warlock!\n\nMy dad and step-dad hated each other, but looking back, they both looked out for my best interests. They both thought my mother's religious stuff was a bit nuts, too. So, they had some common ground. As a side note, my step father must have a special place reserved in Heaven for him because he stuck with her through a decade of absolute hard-core religious fanaticism. She's much more reserved now. \n\nAnyway, on weekends, i'd see my dad. When I'd get there, he'd have a couple VHS tapes ready for me. All my favorite cartoons!  He and I would spend half a day binge watching all that animated evil!  And my car magazines were now being delivered to his house, so I got those too. \n\nMy dad bought me a small tv for my room. It was a 13 inch camping TV. It was about the size of a milk crate. My room had a lot of angles in the walls and ceiling, so I had some good hiding spots. My mom went on a retreat and came back all gung-ho thinking I was on drugs because the evangelist said that any child who wasn't as interested in church as their parents is a child who's being influenced by the devil and most likely is on drugs. My step-dad said he'd search my room for the drugs. She and I stood and watched. He ended up finding the TV (which was in a box in a hidey-hole behind my bed), but he didn't tell her. He found my stash of Mad Magazines too (to her, those were \"100% filth!\"). He didn't tell her about those either. After saying my room was \"clean,\" she left. He walked out with a wink. \n\nWhen I came back from school the next day, my step dad had moved my bed and built me a \"fort\" in the hidey-hole that had a little entertainment center built into the backside of my headboard. He also added two brand new gaming systems. It was cramped, but whenever my mom was off, he and I would gather around my tiny TV in the hidey-hole and play video games.  Why hide?  Because he wasn't allowed to play video games either and he didn't want to get caught either. Whenever she'd come in, we'd pull the cord on the entertainment center which dumped legos out and covered the tv and video game consoles. We'd tell her we were playing legos. She'd ask why we were in the tiny hidey-hole and he'd just be like, \"Forts are awesome, babe!\"  She thought we were nuts, but we got away with it. \n\nCheers to all the dads who helped us get away with shit!","score":"2600","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"My son got his cherry popped when he was 14. Yeesh. Way too early in my opinion. \n\nI was divorced from his mom and recently remarried. His step mom was freaking out harder. She'd signed up for a cute kid not some sexed up teenager.\n\nWe have always had a close relationship and been really honest. So he told me about a situation where a girl he'd fucked had a thug boyfriend but she didn't tell him and now dude wanted to kick his ass. So he was asking for advice. So I'm like \"you're having sex??\" and he says \"oh. Uh, yea. Is that okay?\"\n\nSo I'm lecturing him when wifey walks in. I didn't realize and she heard a lot.\n\nSo she kind of freaked out. She says \"how many?\" and he says \"I don't know. A lot? Well not a lot. I guess like. Hang on. Uh. Seven. Well, I guess seven. You mean like real sex, right? Or are you talking about other stuff?\"\n\nPoor wifey is going nuts. And I don't know what came over her but the next question she blurts out is \"what are you doing with these girls?\"\n\nNow. I know the woman. And what she meant was, do you call them the next day. Are you kind to them. Why are they not coming to the house for dinner and in proper girlfriend situations. And so on.\n\nBut my poor son. He's 14. So he's thick. But bless his heart. He's honest.\n\nSo he kind of stares open mouthed then says \"uuuhhh ... I mean .. sometimes they want ... like ... different things?\"\n\nWifey goes \"AAAHHHHH!!\" and covers her ears.\n\nWhich was hilarious to me.\n\nI used that as an opportunity to pivot. I told him that his body is sacred. That sex is special. That it's a very big deal. That sharing yourself should be reserved for people who deserve it. Essentially, not to be a slut.\n\nI was a sort-of-not-really-but-sort-of big shot club/rave DJ at the time. So I used the example of drunk coked up club girls that hit on me. I could've gotten my dick wet every night from a bevy of girls before I met his step mom and even after some girls were like \"she's not here now, right?\"\n\nBut I didn't do that shit. Because my body is important to me and that kind of intimacy is special. So I tried to get into his head not to just trip and fall into every open pair of thighs he sees.\n\nOf course, I made sure he was using protection. He got condoms at school from the guidance counselor. Fair enough. He said he was scared of getting a girl pregnant, that it happened to a popular boy at school and dude was fucked up. And he spoke about my own ugly divorce. Obviously I regret nothing but he recognizes how fucked up child support can be and wanted nothing to do with that. Plus he said condoms numb the dick so he can go longer. Meaning he gets to rock her world and get a reputation. Which is true. Smart kid.\n\nSo he's not getting anyone pregnant. \n\nAs far as the thug I told him to confront him directly and honestly. To tell him he had no idea, and to be very sorry about it all. That was the approach he took and it all turned out fine.\n\n***\nHe's 19 now.\n\nYeesh.\n\nTeenagers are rough.","score":"53","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

Oh the fucking humanity!\n\nThose greedy climate scientists who lie to us on purpose and who want to rip us off!\n\nAnd it's not like things like coal energy and severe traffic don't have any effect _beside_ climate change. Just ask [China.](http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-579301-breitwandaufmacher-vkpp-579301.jpg)\n\n\u0026gt;But if the deniers are wrong, and the people urging for better environmental protection are right? And we don't do anything? we all fucking die.\n\nOh no, you see: some poor guys in third world countries will actually die. There will be famines and natural disasters. Island states in the south pacific will disappear. While many industrial nations who caused this wreck will feel relatively little. Sure, there might be some additional natural disasters. There might be new mosquito species arriving in countries where they haven't been yet. Wildlife and plants might suffer. Some things might get more expensive. But for the most part you can still live in first world countries. When it becomes worse you might have to abandon some cities at the coastline though. But other countries will have been as good as disappeared by then.\n\nSome will even profit by climate change. The Northwest Passage will be passable for container ships longer and longer due to retreating ice. As ironic and cynic it is to say, there will be losers and winners of climate change.\n\nThe Pentagon is already making plans about what happens when climate change hits us. Old conditions aren't true anymore. Deserts will develop. Countries will wage war for water. China is controlling Tibet and where do you think large parts of Indias water come from? It's the area where China wants to build more hydro-electric power plants. There possibly might be millions of refugees in many areas of the world.\n\nI can recommend the book [\"Spielball Erde\"](https://www.amazon.de/Spielball-Erde-Machtk%C3%A4mpfe-im-Klimawandel/dp/3570101347) - Toy Earth by the german journalist Claus Kleber who was travelling around the earth to document the signs of climate change. And the political, social, economic and military consequences. I hope there already is an english version of it.\n\nEdit: Links about the Pentagons climate change plans: \n\n\u0026gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/military-experts-climate-change-significant-security-risk \n\n\u0026gt;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/7/pentagon-orders-commanders-to-prioritize-climate-c/\n\n\u0026gt;http://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/612710\n\n\u0026gt;http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/06/republicans-trying-to-stop-pentagon-climate-plan-000149\n\n\u0026gt;DOD officials have been warning for years that climate change could have dire consequences on U.S. national security. Increased refugee flows, which are already straining Europe, are likely to accelerate as the climate heats up and have the potential to destabilize large swaths of the world, including the Middle East and South Pacific. The “oil wars” of the 20th century could give way to “water wars,” with countries competing for scarce natural resources. Higher energy costs may further strain the military’s budget and rising water levels could force the DOD to adjust locations of critical infrastructure facilities like ports.\n\n\u0026gt;Republicans say the directive is a distraction from the real threats the Pentagon should be focused on, particularly terrorist groups in the Middle East. “The military, the intelligence community [and] the domestic national security agencies should be focused on ISIS and not on climate change,” said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), who sponsored the amendment to block the funding. **“The fact that the president wants to push a radical green energy agenda should not diminish our ability to counter terrorism.”** Buck dismissed the idea that the military should focus on climate change as a threat: **“The president has talked about an increase in the climate temperature on the planet,” he said. “It is a fraction of a degree every year. How that is a current threat to us is beyond me.”**\n\nJESUS. CHRIST. \n\n\u0026gt;Dakota Wood, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who spent two decades in the Marine Corps, argued that the directive will require additional resources to implement, a costly effort in a time of tight budgets. “You’re just overloading the military with yet more tasks,” he said.\n\n\u0026gt;But experts who have spent years working on climate and defense issues say the directive would save money in the long run by ensuring the Defense Department accounts for climate change in its planning process. It also doesn’t require much in the way of new resources, said Sherri Goodman, a former deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security and a fellow at the Wilson Center. “We already have meteorologists in the military,” she said. “We already have biologists. We already have military construction analysts.”\n\n\u0026gt;Titley said that it could also put a “chilling effect” on other DOD officials as they implement measures to adapt for climate change. The department is capable of fighting the Islamic State and preparing for climate change at the same time, he added, arguing that Buck’s position represented “almost a cartoonish or stereotype of the military’s job, that it is [only] to kill people or break things. OK. But when you are running an adult organization of $600 plus billion, you have a lot of people and you need to consider a lot of things.” \n\n\u0026gt;The military’s warnings about climate change date back to a 2008 National Intelligence Assessment issued during the Bush Administration which stated that climate change could cause disputes over natural resources as well as mass migrations, both of which could lead to further political instability.\n","score":"67","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"As a celibate gay (female) Christian, it's extremely relieving and amazing to have non-religious friends who accept your lifestyle, even if they don't agree with it. Asking us to reconsider is probably the most unhelpful thing you could do. This is never a decision someone comes to lightly, especially once they've been living it for a few years (and all the demons of insecurity and pain have had time to exorcise themselves.)\n\n\nI have gay friends who have my same convictions, I have gay friends who are religious and theologically affirming of gay marriage, I have gay friends who hate religion and do whatever they want. I can't preach to them, they can't preach to me. (one of the main theological points of Christianity is depravity that only the Holy Spirit can stir and convict... I can live my life, I can talk to them about it, but I can't force them to believe something. That's not up to me. ;) )\n\n\nI think it seems like a ridiculous decision to people because why would you put yourself in such a frustrating and negative scenario willingly? But it's important to know that the Christian view of marriage/gender isn't reduced to condemnations. You can't live a life of \"no.\" To borrow a phrase from one of my favorite writers on this topic, Wesley Hill, \"it's a small divine 'no' in the midst of a large divine 'yes.'\" Yes, we get to be saved by Jesus, and redeemed, and loved deeply by him, but part of that Christian relationship (or any relationship) is sacrifice. Some people across the world sacrifice their freedom or lives for the name of the Gospel. \n\n\nIs this worth it? Me sitting here at my desk, gay as ever, letting go of the chance to love and marry another woman? I think so. I truly do. And it's important to note that my belief in Christ and my belief in my lifestyle are intertwined- I couldn't do one without the other. \n\n\nI know, I know, it sounds crazy. Akin to chopping your legs off because the Flying Spaghetti Monster said so. And it seems especially insane because mutual, consensual, legal love (in the mainstream world) has never had this ethical boundary put on it. It seems so trivial to say no just because of your beloved's gender. But the big theological hug of Christianity has a large view of gender, marriage, relationships, sacrifice, suffering, and devotion- and all of those come into play here.\n\n\nI also personally think the Western world has an idolatry of romantic relationships. The larger context of Christianity is one full of love within the church (why the church is called a family so often,) platonic relationships that are deep and fulfilling, incorporation of single people into existing families. \n\n\nDoes this substitute for a romantic relationship? No. I still have lingering aches for what I can't have. And I let myself feel it. Emotional suppression is never healthy, and some days this feels like a wound that will never heal, but you have to lean into that grief. So I'm living and healing and thriving, all at the same time. Anyone who tries to have empathy for this scenario is an A+ friend, in my book.","score":"32","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

The 90s had absolutely no tolerance for anyone even accused of any child related sex crime. It turned into a witch hunt and kangaroo court for people accused.\n\nYes, people who commit those crimes need to be isolated away from children  and typically need professional counseling because it's a disorder. If they commit crimes they need to be imprisoned, but they should not be ostracized for seeking help in controlling their desires if they haven't acted on them.\n\nThe list should only contain violent, repeating, or especially heinous crimes. If not, then the list should not be available to the public. Another alternative would be to require an additional vote after the verdict that requires a higher majority or unanimous vote in order to put someone on the list, similar to the death penalty. \n\n\nThat way if someone is arrested for indecent exposure they could still be convicted without being put on the list. While someone who flashes people/children would be registered. On the same vein a teacher who has sex with their student could be registered without ruining a high-schooler's life because he slept with his girlfriend.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the rant, like I said I have strong views on the subject.\n\nTL;DR the sex offender list system is broken, I have ideas to fix it.","score":"22","subreddit":"TumblrPls"}

So for now, you can't use that plugin at all, unless it is offered by Wordpress.com default plugin selection.\n\nThis is a major source of confusion on Wordpress topics, and I wish they would do more to educate people about the difference, perhaps change the name of one of the services. Shopify or Wix is likely more up your alley if you don't want to mess with code, and you don't want a blog.

They had rich and vast cultural histories, and highly developed trade networks. \n\nThat's not to say it was all peaches and cream, you've pointed out the difference between white blindfold and black armband interpretations of Australian history quite well there. The problem is that you've done it by being on the white blindfold side. The problem is that the issue is more complex than that. Most issues between modern Australia and Indigenous societies have ultimately boiled down to the paternalistic nature in which they have been viewed, there is always an attitude of us needing to \"fix them\", the problem being that in doing so what we ultimately did was dismantle these societies and entrench centuries of disadvantage that we're still struggling to deal with in any meaningful way. \n\nMoving forward the one thing we can really hope is that we've learned something from the past, but the problem is that, much as Australia has done for the last 2 centuries, policies that are being enacted are still, at their very core, paternalistic in nature.

Dorian makes it clear that Tevinter isn't homophobic, but there is an ideal that nobles are meant to live up to and Dorian wasn't having any of it. I felt like it would be no different than if he was a straight man who loved a commoner or peasant. It's not him being gay, its about him being true to himself.\n\nVivianne's quest is perhaps the most boring of them. Fetch the thing, quest complete, spend five seconds to see that she had a lover she cared deeply towards; quest over. But I'm really not sure how much they could really do with her character. She's not touchy-feely and guards herself closely. Not sure how that could really develop without feeling forced.\n\nI liked Iron Bull's quest, up until the point where the decision whether or not to sacrifice the Chargers was left to the Inquisitors. I just thought it felt forced into the story.\n\nThe one I loved the most was Cole's quest, because I actually enjoyed wrestling with my decision on what to do with him. Until Trespasser, the decision was difficult. They both had merits. As a human, Cole slowly is able to relate to more people and he is able to become a part of the world and not just existing around it, trying to heal the pain. And as a Spirit, he accepts himself for what he originally was. He can help more people that way and he is happy to do so without anyone remembering to give him their gratitude, which lives up to him as a Spirit of compassion.

People here say it's unfair to judge him on that, since he basically hasn't played all season and a 20-something minute cameo doesn't reflect his real skill set, but rewatch the game and focus on him specifically.\n\nHis effort after coming on is pathetic. He brings some energy to the team (as you would expect from any fast winger coming off the bench), but he looks disinterested and lazy out of possession. Looks like he isn't bothered. Loses the ball and can't be arsed to chase after it.\n\nAll the people in here say how he needs playing time to find his feet - yet during the time he's been given in the Fenerbahce game, Rooney worked harder on and off the ball despite playing from the first whistle. I was surprised to still see people make excuses for him after a disastrous appearance like that. If anything, Mkhitaryan should be trying harder than anyone else to prove his worth and get into the first 11.\n\nAnd to all the people saying he's not been treated well by Mourinho with all his comments - these people are professional footballers. They play for Manchester United. Manchester United. No player deserves to start because of their talent alone. They have to work for it. No player should think they've made it because they've signed for us. So if the manager says he's not putting enough effort in, he's not putting enough effort in. Quite frankly, I trust the boss who's lucky enough to see these players day in day out in training.

Ghettoization is a real risk, and develops over decades, not mere years.  The experience of the race riots in the 60s are conspicuously absent from this articles retrospective, it is far easier to attack someone as \"other\" if you don't know them personally.\n\nOn CP itself, I think it has more to do with how citizens conduct their private lives than anything a government can tinker with.  You can't force an employer to hire, nor an individual landlord to rent, nor a waiter to provide service with a smile, or go the extra mile.  Simply by being in the majority, we enjoy some of these subtle dignities.  In my opinion, as our civil society develops, the intellectuals and elites will do more, and the government can do less.","score":"15","subreddit":"singapore"}

And i disagree in most of your points.\n\n\"one does not need to worry about a single thing, she can just dash into the battlefield without a single care, deploy her shield and she is good to go.\" Ok this is completly wrong, do you really believe that tone can just rush down in front whitout cover? she will get obliterated if not using the correct amount of cover, dashes, or teammates.\n\n\" I do believe that killing Pilots should be Tone's forte \"\nSo you basically want to Tone be underpowered and not being able to do anything against a Titan? \n\n\"I would like to think Scorch is best to deny areas \"\nHe is, in a narrow corridors he deny entry outnumberes, Tone cant do that outnumbered, his shield isnt that op.\n\n\"Ronin's Sword core not only pushes back targets but he himself has to get right into the enemy's face. Northstar's core is just a notification to let the enemy know she is an easy shot for some seconds. Point is you can't always use your core, there are risks. Not with Tone, she can even sit behind cover and shoot her core into the sky.\"- Here, these are problems whit other titans kit, not tone being op, Roning shouldnt push enemy on swing, and Northstar  should have a shield when core is activated, and when shooting the salvo in the air, you have enough time to get cover, if you didnt notice her using her core, thats the pilot taking advantage of your mistake, as would any other titan do.\n\n\"Tracking Rockets:\nWhy does this have no cooldown? \" but it isnt ready from time 0, you have to first, land the 3 marcs, its not like you can shot rockets for free, and get close enough and get good position from where your shots wont hit a wall or a roof, you dont fight a tone a medium range, you get close or get far, if you want to fight in medium range you pick legion or ion.\n\n\" Most Titans have a high risk, high reward. Want to charge your Railgun? Sure, but here's a mobility decrease.\" Northstar is a sniper, thats how it should be. High damage low movility\n\n \"Want to Flank as Ronin? Sure, but you need to be quickly in and out due to your 7,500 health and if you're not hitting crit's you might as well not be there.\" You may want to use hit and run tacticks whi him, and go only in when you can secure the kill, but roning should use some buffs\n\n\"When I used to play Tone, I used to kill Pilots and Titans so frequently and it wasn't until I switched over to other Titans that I realised Tone out-does everything that other Titans can do besides flanking, she's so good it's like a cheat.\" Killing pilots shouldnt be a factor here, as any pilot would die in 1 shot,  maybe when you switched you felt underwelmed but this is for the learning curve, you expected to win as easly whit a new titan as you didt whit a titan already mastered, if you change from Legion to ronin you would be in the same spot.\n\nI agree that Tone should use a \"tone\" down, but not as far as only being good killing pilots, what's the point then?, The OTHER titans NEED A BUFF, see Ronin and Northstar, they have problems that could be easly fixed and be competitive, Ion and Legion are strong in their own acord, I cant talk about Scorch as I havent played her.\n\nSorry for bad english\n\n\n","score":"-4","subreddit":"titanfall"}

Yes the executive is not being allowed to unilateral change the law. But that does not mean the same law will not be passed later does it? The ruling party has a majority in parliament and it seems unlikely that the party whip will not be in force.\nThe New Zealand case  Fitzgerald v Muldoon was actually a very similar case. In that the prime minister unilaterally announced the discontinuation of the superannuation scheme. He was taken to court and the court said \"yes, that was illegal\". But they didn't do anything. The judge just witheld his judgement until the proper law had been passed.\n\nThese big policy and judicial review cases seem really big, but they are little more than a slap on the wrist for the government. There is no substantive things the courts can do in a Westminster democracy because the judiciary has no real power. There is no supreme document or constitution to strike down decisions or law from. It is very different to the US system I assume most people in this thread are familair with (frankly most people in the UK don't know its different).\n\nUltimately this is all just a blip for the UK's government's plan.

{"body":"This is a commonly held viewpoint, not that sin causes earthquakes but that nature's violence has a spiritual connection.  It is based on a completely incorrect understanding of what was written in Romans 8, where the text says \"22We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until the present time. \"\n\nIf you look in context, the writer is discussing entropy (see the previous line) then goes on to say that mankind is also 'groaning' inwardly.  The idea is actually not that of natural disasters but instead one of anticipation and expectation, a longing for a future without conflict and decay.\n\nThere is ZERO evidence that 'sin' causes natural disasters.  In fact, this idea is dismissed in the Old Testament where a writer states : \"... I am the LORD, and there is no other, The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing well-being and creating calamity; I am the LORD who does all these.\"  (Isaiah)  The idea here is that neither natural disasters nor good results are related to how sinful anyone may or may not be.  In fact, even the writer of the gospel of Luke attribute a similar idea to Jesus when he is credited with saying this: \"Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam collapsed on them: Do you think that they were more sinful than all the others living in Jerusalem? \"  The writer goes on to dismiss that idea saysing that everyone is equally 'sinful' and in need of 'repentance' (based on the Greek, this simply means to choose a different direction in life.  Not to run up to the front of some church and wail about what a terrible person you are.)\n\nThe notion that cause (sin) results in effect (natural disaster and death) is wrong, even if you accept the notion of a wrathful god that this moron preaches about.   If it were true, based on the hypocrisy of many in the modern church, there would be a lot more lighting strikes on church buildings...\n\n","score":"76","subreddit":"worldnews"}

Perhaps, but what if they found nothing? And I'm talking more about the idea that, just because that coin/apple has fallen to the ground 99 times already, it doesn't mean it is going to the next time, or the next time, of the next time.

{"body":"Let me help you out, fam: \n\nUSE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE TO CREATE MEMES TO EXPOSE THIS CONTENT TO THE WORLD - part 1:\n\n#BringDownTheRing\n\nIN BRIEF http://pastebin.com/jXHpiN1M Comet Pizza is a pizza place owned by James Alefantis, who is the former gay boyfriend of David Brock, the CEO of Correct The Record. It has been the venue for dozens of events for the Hillary campaign staff. John Podesta has had campaign fundraisers there for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. John's brother and business partner Tony Podesta has his birthday party there every year. It's also a dive that according to reviews and photos has hidden bathroom doors and creepy murals. The bathrooms in particular have murals exclusively of nude women, as well as a great deal of graffiti relating to sex. Reviews of the restaurant are bizarrely polarized. Websites describing it positively note that there are regularly \"unsupervised children running around\". Their menu include a pedophilic symbol, as do the signs and decorations of other neighboring businesses. https://i.sli.mg/7hr0h9.jpg The music acts and the posters promoting same acts are bizarre in their presentation, content, and lyrical focus, but are still promoted as being \"for all ages\". The overtly sexual content would suggest otherwise. The same has taken place in reference to videos recorded inside Comet Ping Pong by people that frequent their establishment as well as video referencing Comet Ping Pong positively from the exterior. While initially not the central focus of the investigation at the onset, Comet Ping Pong is a much more overt and much more disturbing hub of coincidences. Everyone associated with the business is making semi-overt, semi-tongue-in-cheek, and semi-sarcastic inferences towards sex with minors. The artists that work for and with the business also generate nothing but cultish imagery of disembodiment, blood, beheadings, sex, and of course pizza. Tons of pre-existing evidence of global pedo-ring implicating governments and etc.: http://pastebin.com/Jn2LfXg4 James Alefantis Comet Ping Pong owned by James Alefantis, once listed 49th \"most influential\" person in DC by GQ: http://www.gq.com/gallery/50-most-powerful-people-in-washington-dc#slide=49 Backup: https://i.sli.mg/h6EHML.jpg James Alefantis cought in love triangle with chief of Media Matters, David Brock; Allegations of blackmail and a payout amounting to $850,000. Brock and Alefantis were co-defendents in a suit filed by William Gray. http://archive.is/xSXjk https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30428 James Alefantis' instagram late 11/5/16. by morning of 11/7/16 it was set to private. We recently found the instagram account of James Alefantis. The contents of it are indescribably bizarre and the contexts of the posts and comment chains are weird. Alefantis does not have any children nor do his closest associates, but the photos seem to be a near constant assortment of different children of a variety of ages, intermingled between posts about gay bars, clubs, photos of common rape drugs, and piles of foreign currency. After it being trawled through for 24 hours it has been set to private. A large set of archived copies can be seen here in the next section. Similarly the instagram and twitter accounts of Comet Ping Pong are being edited selectively. The accounts of the people favoriting and commenting on these posts are equally bizarre in both content, context, and demeanor. http://archive.is/9FN8n - Girl, striped, taped to table http://archive.is/r93DT - Michelle Obama playing Ping Pong http://archive.is/vSqri - Girl, drinking milk http://archive.is/vaDfJ - Girl, standing in basket http://archive.is/jXWrG - Photo of refrigerated meat locker, weird comments http://archive.is/0Az6u - Baby eating pizza \"oh my god.

{"body":"People often confuse evolution with the idea that we are biologically always improving. Per Darwin's theory, evolution does not necessarily result in a \"better\" species, but one that is better adapted to its environment. Often times those adaptations make animals slower, less curious/intelligent, and less likely to reproduce if that means an improved chance of survival. To the last point on reproduction - if a large colony is more easily detected by predators which will kill the entire colony, evolution would favour a slow growth rate that stays un-detected. \n\nTo answer your more direct question - evolution only works by improving your chances of survival. If someone is immune to a life-threatening disease, that disease would have to kill off all of the people that aren't immune for the population to \"evolve\" to be immune. The majority of STDs don't kill you, so evolution can't help you there. \n\nWith that in mind, I question the premise that multiple partners if favored by evolution. Certainly having a lot of offspring will help spread your DNA, and if the desire for multiple partners is in your DNA (not sure that is the case though) than there is genetic favorability for men with multiple partners. It's similar to the premise that since attractive people are more likely to find a partner and mate, we should be getting more and more attractive with each generation. Neither are examples of evolution, but rather another form of genetic selection.","score":"15","subreddit":"askscience"}

{"body":"People who say stuff like \"it could easily have been done by now\" are people who have no idea how the parliamentary system works, and  no clue how complex this law is going to have to be to satisfy all of the interested parties. If it's two lax somebody's going to be dragging it to the Supreme Court. If it's too strict somebody's going to be dragging it to the Supreme Court. I'm sure the government would like to avoid having laws overturned, Stephen Harper certainly didn't enjoy his four losses at the Supreme Court.\n\nFirst off The current laws relating to marijuana as a controlled substance have to be amended. We can't have one law saying marijuana is legal and another one saying it is not.  \n\nThe government has to consult with the provinces because we have to find a way to standardize things across Canada. Every province is going to have different wants, needs and concerns and those all must be addressed. We don't want to have different standards province to province. We're in the process of trying to eliminate that for alcohol and other things within Canada so obviously it's important that marijuana legalization follows the newer Canada wide model.\n\nThe framework for a recreational distribution system has to be set up. They can't just throw that to the wind and say \"oh well we'll see what happens after legalization\" because all of this has to be in place before the bill is signed into law.\n\nConsultations with different medical organizations specifically relating to age and THC restrictions for people under 25. I'm sure the government would like to throw that out the door and ignore it but there is enough \"concern\" from doctors and special interest groups that it must be addressed. After all, Little Johnny can vote at 18, he can join the army and 18, but apparently he may not be mature enough to decide whether he wants to smoke weed or not. /S\n\nRegulations on who can grow, who can sell, what specifically can be sold. Are there going to be THC limits on edibles, who is going to be legally allowed to produce edibles? Are mail order dispensaries going to be legal?  Are storefront dispensaries going to be legal?  Besides edibles what forms can recreational marijuana take? There are a lot of ways to consume weed and all of those have to be addressed and included or excluded from the law. You don't want to buy a dab and get arrested for having marijuana in a form that is not legally mandated.\n\n\"Impaired\" driving. There is no reliable way to test for cannabis impairment. The blood test don't work. That means something is going to have to be decided so that folks who indulge and drive while high can be treated appropriately.\n\nThis is not simply a case boys and girls of writing a few words on a piece of paper saying yay or nay in Parliament and it's done. It's a complex law, we want it done right the first time so that there are no Supreme Court challenges. We don't want a new government to be able to come in at four years or eight years and dismantle it easily.\n\nI have no doubt I've missed a lot of stuff that's going to have to be included in this law but if you think it's easy and should be quick you're wrong. \n\nAs for what's going on right now, anybody with even an iota of gray matter knows that recreational marijuana is still illegal so behave accordingly.  For the folks opening up dispensaries and getting busted, well they knew it was illegal and took their chances.  While I personally think it is a waste of police resources to do this it's still against the law and if the police or municipal governments receive complaints they have to deal with them.  \n\nThis is been a very long time coming and we're close. Let them do what they need to do. Quit being like Mark Emery and bitching and whining about everything.  \n\nAnyway I'm sure this will start some arm waving by people who, as I said in my first paragraph, don't understand what's involved in this.

His attorneys are mounting a vigorous defense on his behalf, and need your help.\n\nMarty has dedicated years of his life to fighting for the human rights of institutionalized children.\n\nHe would often spend 8 hours at his job, come home, and spend another 8 hours campaigning against child abuse.\n\nHe never profited from his activism.\n\nBefore over a dozen FBI agents raided his home and took every computer he owned, he and his wife opened their guest bedroom to survivors of the “troubled teen industry,” powerful and politically connected for profit organizations with an extremely well documented record of atrocities against children.\n\nIn 2013, Marty began a campaign against troubled teen industry institution Logan River Academy. Dozens of survivors left heartwrenching petition comments and some created videos.\n\nMarty’s story first hit main stream media after he and his wife experienced trouble with their boat and were rescued by a Disney Cruise Ship.\n\nSince the FBI left out Justina’s name and her suffering from its complaint against him, many outlets merely printed that he allegedly “cyber-attacked” a hospital.\n\nMarty’s family, friends and Anonymous have launched the #FreeMartyG campaign to set the record straight and call on the public to show their support for him.\n\nAbout the Justina Pelletier Scandal:\n\n﻿Justina Pelletier was 14 years old when she arrived at Boston Children’s Hospital E.R. with her mother.\n\nBoth she and her older sister had been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease, a condition that is often genetic and runs in families.\n\nHowever, doctors at Boston Children’s Hospital felt her symptoms had psychological causes, and just 4 days after meeting her, wanted to stop successful mitochondrial disease treatments prescribed since 2011.\n\nFearful for her life, Justina’s parents refused to consent to such a radical departure from her well established treatment plan.\n\nThey tried to discharge their daughter and bring her to previously scheduled appointments with her mitochondrial disease team.\n\nWhat followed was any family’s nightmare. Unwilling to take “no” for an answer, Boston Children’s Hospital urged state officials to take custody of Justina and enforce their new treatment plan.\n\nThis kind of thing happens more often than you might think. In fact, Boston Children’s Hospital even has a name for it. They call it a “parentectomy”.\n\nHer contact with her family was severely limited, monitored, and censored.\n\nShe was not allowed to discuss her condition or treatment. Her father reported that at the behest of Boston Children’s Hospital, a gag order was imposed seeking to prevent the family from speaking to the media.\n\nThankfully, Justina smuggled notes describing her suffering to her family hidden in art projects and her father bravely defied the gag order and spoke out.\n\nAn affidavit with misleading statements from BCH doctors was presented in court and the Pelletiers lost custody of their youngest daughter.\n\nHer medications were stopped, leaving her in constant agony with a dangerous heart rhythm.\n\nA national and international outcry ensued, with #FreeJustina climbing to the top of Twitter.\n\nNews of Justina’s deterioration and family’s struggle to return her desperately needed mitochondrial disease therapies to her before it was too late touched millions.\n\nFormer BCH employees spoke out, confirming that Justina was being tortured. With public scrutiny of BCH’s doctors and its psych ward building, Justina was transferred out of Boston Children’s Hospital to a troubled teen industry facility, Wayside Youth and Family, where her suffering under the BCH treatment plan continued.\n\nShe also endured additional indignities there.\n\nEventually, after 16 months of incredible suffering, and thanks to the effort of MartyG and thousands of others , Justina was allowed to return home.\n\nShe still hasn’t recovered from the ordeal though.\n\nShe and her family have sued Boston Children’s Hospital and 4 of its doctors for gross negligence and civil rights violations.\n\nWhen the lawsuit was filed, Justina was quoted saying, “ It was awful. Just imagine being a psych ward without needing to be in a psych ward.”\n","score":"35","subreddit":"conspiracy"}

People have been hospitalized with gunshot wounds, so now they need to explain how a man with a \"butcher knife\" was able to shoot bullets out of his knife if we are to believe there was only one person armed with a knife injuring people.\n12:30pm CST\n\n[The Reddit Angle](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5fc3ie/comment/daj68on?st=IW2FSH1M\u0026amp;sh=7a686dea): Picture of a wrecked silver sedan, allegedly the car used to run people over.

At the receive end, another prism-like device splits the light out by color, and sends each color to a different receiver.\n\nThe advantages are:\n\n* each individual laser / receiver can operate at a slower bitrate\n* you only need one strand of fiber to carry all the signals\n* for very long fiber runs (100s of kilometers), the midspan amplifiers can amplify the entire group of signals at once, without breaking them out individually\n\nThe disadvantages:\n\n* the optical bits at each end add to the cost\n* the lasers have to be tuned very precisely. Things like temperature drift become important since one laser might drift in color enough to affect its neighbor.\n\nThere are other advantages and disadvantages that come into play with large systems, but those are the highlights.","score":"-5","subreddit":"networking"}

That's the only message everyone needs to take and the problem that they need to address, everyone is in their big city bubble and nobody gives a shit about the average joe in the rest of the country facing who knows how many absurd obstacles.\n\nThe people who only vote for a candidate because they felt like the other side was mean or smug, can go fuck themselves. The democrats or liberals don't need to be nicer to appeal to a bigger crowd, they just need to get their shit together and care about everyone, even those poor folks who hillary couldn't give less of a shit about because while I'm no expert on the rural america that elected trump I can tell you something for certain, they don't give a shit about katy perry, beyonce or jay z. But no, Hillary wanted to win with just the minority vote and fearmongering, even if trump lied to them at least those lies had more hope to the people that voted for trump.\n\nSo what liberals need to do is not polish their message to make it less rude but rather care about EVERYONE, not just racial or gender minorities. \n\n\nA condescending trump wasn't the decider when it came to electing trump, I have no idea why everyone keeps spouting that bullshit lately.","score":"-3","subreddit":"television"}

It was one of the more dramatic and cinematic scenes of the video and could've added another minute or so in having him actually escape.\n\nThe use of props (the guns-- both real and fake-- the helicopter, the motorbikes, E.T., etc) and tertiary characters (Mister Negi and Wheels and the Tap Brothers) are a delight that add alot of intrigue to the videos, and I hope it's a practice that Frank persists with.\n\nIn all, this felt like a culminating video to tie together the past year of Frank content back to a finer point, so that it can be threaded through the needle-hole of storytelling. I can only hope that Frank has even grander plans, and doesn't become content with a constant hype/upload cycle where he promises lore content and then just gives us a ~15 min video of him dicking around in costume-- don't get me wrong, a Frank video is a Frank video and nothin' like a good nut, ya feel, but there's no reason we can't have the best of all aspects of the content.","score":"35","subreddit":"FilthyFrank"}

{"body":"During the eviction process if your sister feels unsafe about her situation it may be in her best interest to stay in a long-term hotel of some sort if at all possible. I would strongly recommend this regardless of her concerns for her safety if it is financially feasible since you mention he is making her life hell. A couple important things to note:\n\n- Once the 30 days is up she will need to follow the proper procedure for eviction in her locale. This website can help her find out about the process if she follows the relevant links on the page: https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/evicting-tenant-0\n\n- Your sister should keep written records of what exactly he is doing to \"make her life hell\". If he is damaging properly or being abusive to either her or the children this can be brought up in court during the eviction and if she needs to file suit for compensation (for damages) or press charges (for any abuse, though it will be difficult to make this stick due to the nature of the situation with him being an officer). Please note that Illinois is a two-party consent state, meaning it is illegal to record audio without all parties involved consenting to it.\n\n- She cannot, under any circumstances, change the locks before the eviction or otherwise attempt to keep him from the home. This is a surefire way to prolong the process even further, possibly invoke financial penalties, and generally make a mess of things that will be cut and dry once they get moving (after the 30 days).\n\n- Once the 30 days have passed and a court date is set, your sister still cannot do anything to restrict his access to her home (sorry, I know it's not what you want to hear). At the court date the judge, if he/she rules in your sister's favor (and I see no reason for her not to, since there is no rent being paid and there is no lease), will provide a date that the ex must leave the house by. This will be ~14 days.\n\n- If the ex still has not moved out by the date specified in the court order, your sister will need to Sheriff's department and have them assist her in evicting the ex. I don't imagine they will be very happy to do this to a fellow officer, but they are required to by law. If there is any undue delay or problems caused by the officers I would make sure to note them in writing in case of a potential suit later against the sheriff's office if they don't follow procedure and it negatively affects your sister. \n\n- DO NOT CHANGE THE LOCKS! Even if the date specified by the court order comes to pass, it is still illegal to change the locks or otherwise force the tenant (the ex) out. The only person who may legally remove the tenant in a forcible manner is the sheriff.\n\n- The ex's belonging will not be removed from the home by the sheriff. You have three options. First, you may have the ex take them with him. If they don't want to do that, or you don't wish to give them that option, you may ask them to put them in storage. If they do not comply with that option, you may place their belongings on the curb for them. Take care not to damage them and ensure that all of them are accounted for (I'd recommend taking pictures to prove that they were all present and in good condition) to avoid a lawsuit about damaged or stolen property from the ex later. \n\n- DO NOT CHANGE THE LOCKS OR FORCIBLY REMOVE THE EX! DON'T DO IT! IT WILL GET YOUR SISTER IN LEGAL TROUBLE!\n\n- Lastly, please tell your sister to call the police and report any instances of abuse or other dangerous situations arising with the ex. Don't let her just take it because she thinks the police won't do anything about it.","score":"101","subreddit":"legaladvice"}

He threw a few wild punches and then helped her get back up. \n\nMy suggestion again would for certain people to learn the lesson every male knows: do not pick fights with people twice your size.

All that is saying is that a model can only make one attack with a grenade regardless of if it has multiple attacks on its profile. It is further reinforcing the \"ONE grenade!\" rule, not expanding it to allow everyone to use one.  \n\n\n\n","score":"-5","subreddit":"Warhammer30k"}

I could speculate about the reasons for this fact (maybe white students have better access, maybe white students get better scholarship counseling by advisors in high school and in college, maybe white students are perceived as more meritous by the granting bodies), but that would not lead to much. \n\nThe point is that it's blatantly unfair. Scholarships in the US, whether need or merit based, are very unfair and are likely to help upper middle class and rich kids, not students with higher financial needs. \n\nGranting scholarships to students from minority families is a way to make the whole system a little bit less absurd and the racial distribution a little bit fairer. \n\nHowever, there is no fairness in this system. it is, ultimately, luck-based - you need advisors that know the right scholarships for you, and you need to be at least partially lucky to secure a full ride, or any kind of scholarship. \n","score":"16","subreddit":"changemyview"}

The very nature of a vacuum tube is to run a high voltage current through a plate, then run the signal across it to boost it.\n\nThis affects the sound in unique ways that solid state would have to specifically \"emulate\" to reproduce. Its why guitar amps are generally vacuum tube based so when they are cranked they compress, overdrive and add layers of harmonic overtones; with additional methods of affecting the tone having massive characteristic changes as you affect pre or post amp gain or push signal boosters through the input source.\n\nLikewise, an audio amp has a very different way of amplifying the source. It generally bleeds the equalisation (tone) stack together and adds minor overtones; creating a very subtle chorus-esque vibe, general resulting in richer, fuller sounds.\n\nLikewise, vinyl is an analogue source. Sweeps to and from higher or lower outputs have to have interpolation and there is no bit rate. The result is a smoother output; even if there is noise from the player.","score":"17","subreddit":"pcmasterrace"}

{"body":"The duck is a number of species in the Anatidae family of birds. They are related to swans and geese.\n\nDucks are mostly aquatic birds living in both fresh water and sea water and found on every continent except for Antarctica.\n\nA male duck is called a drake, a female duck a hen, and a baby duck a duckling.\n\nDucks are omnivores. They feed on aquatic plants, small fish, insects, worms, grubs and more. People often feed domesticated ducks bread.\n\nDiving ducks and sea ducks search for food fairly deep underwater. To be able to stay underwater more easily, diving ducks are quite heavy.\n\nDabbling ducks feed on the surface of water, on land, or by ducking their head underwater. Along the edge of their beak is a comb-like structure called a pecten, that enables them to hold slippery food and filter nutrients out of the water.\n\nA common urban legend is that a ducks quack does not echo. This has however, been proven to be false.\n\nDucks are curious and friendly creatures they have been domesticated as pets and farm animals for more than 500 years. All domestic ducks are descended from either the Mallard or the Muscovy duck.\n\nThe most common and recognised species of duck is the Mallard or Wild duck. It is a dabbling duck that lives in the Americas, Europe, Asia, North Africa, and has been introduced to New Zealand and Australia.\n\nThe male Mallard has a glossy green head, grey wings and belly, while the female has a brown-speckled plumage. Mallard ducks have a moulting season, they are vulnerable during this time as the moulting stops them flying.\n\nMallard ducks live 5 to 10 years in the wild and 8+ years in captivity.\n\nParadise Shelducks of New Zealand often have one mating partner for life.\n\nAll ducks have highly waterproof feathers due to the feathers interlocking nature and waxy coating.\n\nDucks have many economic uses. Their feathers, particularly their underlying 'down' feathers, are used in many products, while the white Pekin duck is the most common variety raised for eggs and meat.\n\nDucks have featured as popular cartoon characters over the years, such as Walt Disney's Donald Duck and Warner Brothers, Daffy Duck.","score":"15","subreddit":"the_meltdown"}

The one thing you do need to be careful with the \"red ink disappear\" trick is, some red pens actually have enough blue in them that they won't disappear. Orange is often a better choice.\n\nIf you have no access to anywhere that sells 下敷き then just get red cellophane anywhere else.\n\nETA: Also in Japan many study guides will have the important parts printed in pink for this reason, so you can put your 下敷き over it and quiz yourself.","score":"41","subreddit":"LearnJapanese"}

{"body":"This is my entire collection of Naruto hentai. There are roughly 4635 images totaling 7.75 GB across about 327 folders. Of that, there are 57 comics (~1773 images), 12 image sets (~700 images), and the rest are loose images. \n\n\nThe collection is organized mostly by which female characters appear in the image. There is a folder for each combination of women which is represented within my collection. So, if you want images with Hinata, go to the folder marked \"Hinata.\" If you want images with Hinata and Sakura, go to the folder marked \"z Hinata, Sakura.\" All folders that contain images of more than one woman are marked with a z first in order to force them to the end of the list. For folders with multiple women, the women’s names will appear in alphabetical order. There is also a folder which contains my images which have 5 or more women in them, which is marked “orgies, 5 women or more.” Please note, that only images with only a single girl will appear in folders marked with only a single name. As in, no images with Hinata and Sakura will appear in \"Hinata.\" So if you want every image with Hinata, regardless of who else is in the image, you must look for those other folders that include Hinata, as well as go through the image sets for her. I know this makes it harder to get a single collection of any given girl from this, but it makes it far, far easier to keep things neat and orderly and especially to be able to check whether or not I already have an image.\n\n\nThere are a couple exceptions to this method. The image sets are in their own separate folder marked “Image Sets” and then further divided into their own separate folders. The comics are organized the same way. \n\n\nSorry it's not in Imgur, but their discontinuation of the ability to sort images by file name as well as their lack of a way to upload entire folders at once made it impossible for me to upload my collection there. I had wanted to use imgur as it would have made it easier to post some folders separately and allow people to see things more easily without having to search through a great number of folders or leave Reddit, but this is the best I could do.\n\nAlso, I apologize for taking so long to get this up, but I was in the process of getting more images. Since I made the post asking for a recommended image hosting site, I have acquired over 500 more images including a comic and a large image set by the same artist that made Konoha Genei Jutsu. Of that 500, I also found the rest of two image sets I already had, one of which I increased by over 100 images and got the captioned versions. ","score":"17","subreddit":"Naruto_Hentai"}

You aren't using sidechaining or EQ, and both are only playing one note, and those notes are the same.\n\nAt most BPMs, the starting point of the kick will coincide with a different part of the sub sine wave each time the kick hits. Depending on which part this is, they will either interfere constructively, giving you twice the volume of sub, or destructively, and give you zero sub. (or somewhere in between). This means that every time your kick hits, you will get a totally different amount of sub and it'll be really inconsistent.\n\nHowever, if the frequency of the sub is an exact multiple of the BPM e.g. a 50Hz sub is 50 cycles a second, and a BPM of 120 is one beat every half second, so 25 cycles is exactly one beat. \n\nIn this case (50Hz sub + kick, 120 bpm), the kick and the sub will interfere exactly the same way each time, so you get \n\nexactly \n\neither double or half the sub (or somewhere in between) every time.\n\nThis is all pretty much useless considering you could just sidechain your sub to the kick and get rid of the problem entirely with better results\n\n","score":"27","subreddit":"edmproduction"}

{"body":"I was in an abusive relationship and one of the things he would do was CONSTANTLY push my physical boundaries. It was SO aggravating, annoying, and hurtful. He would tickle me constantly (I HATE BEING TICKLED) and then when I got upset he would treat me like I was a CRAZY PERSON, he'd accuse me of being SO DRAMATIC, so rude, and then would get totally huffy and upset, making ME feel guilty for not liking what happens to my body! It was fucked up! He'd be like, \"God, you are so dramatic, why can't you just be cool?\"  Like, I would be a better girlfriend if I enjoyed tickling. And he would seriously not stop. \n\nThen that started to translate into sexual stuff. He would NOT listen when I told him certain things were uncomfortable or unpleasant. Like, I'm not big on receiving oral sex (it's alright, I don't hate it but I don't enjoy it immensely) and he would take that as like a CHALLENGE, like he was going to force me to enjoy something I am pretty \"meh\" about so he could earn some kind of badge of honor. My needs were never considered. It was all about gaining the reaction from me that validated HIM. \n\nThere was other stuff, but these examples seem relevant to your situation. I have to say, once I left this relationship I realized that this constant ignoring of my physical boundaries, the fights and manipulation surrounding me expressing my needs and feelings, constantly being subjected to unwanted physical contact, and the mind games of sexual contact only being about his pleasure and the powerlessness that created, has severely fucked me up. \n\nAt the time I didn't think any of this was that big of a deal. A miscommunication, me overreacting, etc...but overall, just a small hiccup in what I thought was a loving relationship. Psychologically the damage that was done has taken years to reverse, but it was only until I was in a safe and healthy emotional environment that I could really \"unpack\" all of it and process it. \n\nI would get panic attacks with my husband and intimacy was a minefield for a long time. I had no idea I had any of these issues until long after I left the abusive relationship, it was like I suppressed all of it. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, you need to understand that his behavior IS abusive. It IS rapey. It's NOT okay. And the emotional and psychological consequences of having your physical boundaries pushed over, and over, and over again, your needs constantly ignored, and then being mocked, ridiculed, punished, and blamed for expressing yourself are HUGE. This WILL affect you over time. This is not healthy. \n\nSo. What do you do about it? Honestly I don't know. My own experiences make me very emotional about the issue so it's hard for me to say anything besides \"run run run run!\" But who would break up with a long-term relationship over boob-grabbing, right? Like how crazy does that sound? I get it. I know you won't break up with him over this. \n\nBut I can guarantee that if he does this, there are other little things happening that you justify and downplay and think are okay. And you believe each of those things are isolated instead of part of a greater picture. \n\nbut maybe I'm wrong and this is the only thing he does that is \"off\". I guess the best thing you can do here is stop trying to Explain, Justify, Argue, or Defend. Do not engage when he tries to start arguments about the issue. Don't defend yourself. Shrug your shoulders when he calls you crazy and be like, \"Hm, that's nice.\" The boundary is non-negotiable. This isn't a discussion about whether or not it's okay for you to have the boundary. \n\nAnd honestly, do you see yourself being happy with a weak-willed sex monster who apparently loses his brain when he sees boobies? I mean, REALLY? You think this is a lack of control or understanding, but honestly he is doing this on purpose.

Braasch was described by one journalist as \"a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager.\"[30][31] The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park,[32]after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two beers. He first took on Serena and after leading 5–0, beat her 6–1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6–2.[33]Braasch said afterwards, \"500 and above, no chance.\" He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game \"fun.\"[34] Braasch said the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier, and that men put spin on the ball that the women can't handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.\"\n\n\nAlso the men's high school record for 100m dash is faster than the women's Olympic record. \n","score":"1086","subreddit":"todayilearned"}

It's not about merely expressing anger, *it's about demonstrating that the anger will continue as long as president Park steps down.*\n\n**2)** No, the protests are not enough to pressure Park to step down. However, the protests are able to pressure major political parties and the Senate, who in turn *can* pressure Park to step down. \n\nThe Saenuri Party, the major political party that Park belongs to, now does not want to be associated with Park and many of party members are demanding that Park steps down. The police has been pressured into launching a formal criminal investigation and an Independent Counsel against Park. All of these would not have been actioned if the public have not voiced their dissatisfaction so strongly and consistently.\n\n**3)** These protests and the overwhelming demonstration of public opinion has given independence to the Korean media. Korean media have always been heavily censored by the government and are traditionally very conservative. However, in the recent few weeks, the major news channels have been openly criticizing Park as they feel more \"protected\" and \"supported\" with the public on their side.\n\n**4)** The protests (because, let's be honest, they really are impressive show of force) have been fundamental in increasing public awareness of Park's wrongdoings, both within Korea and outside Korea.

Some racists might be that way, but in most cases I don't think it's that simple.\n\nMost racists aren't so extreme as to think that *all* people of a race are bad.  They can even have many friends of that race, or admire certain individuals (especially athletes or musicians), while still viewing the race negatively overall.  They might just view their friend as an exception, as \"one of the good ones\", and still think that in general, that some races are inherently better than others.

His passion for Trumpian politics is particularly hard to take given that he raised three daughters and always encouraged us to be independent, to use intellectual rigor, and to believe in our own abilities. Sadly, it turns out that beneath all that, a huge streak of paternalism ran in him.

None of the animated ones feature white men. The closest is a maybe-white/maybe-Japanese male whose voice actor is a white boy. Other than that, you've got two white women playing animals, a Pacific Islander girl and a Japanese woman with a British voice actress.\n\nOf the 15 non-cartoons, 7 feature white men. But one is a documentary about the UT Austin shooter. And one is a comic book hero who will eventually wind up being black. Four feature white women, two feature black men, one indigenous American and one Indian boy.\n\nIf you look at the tops of the box office, there are a lot more white men. But it's basically all action heroes and comic book characters so I doubt that's the kind of characters she feels she's missing out on. If Natalie Portman is looking for roles where all she has to do is look pretty and have CGI happen around her, well, I'm sure she knows how to find them.\n\nAt the risk of intersectionality, one group that might actually have room to complain (you know, besides beautiful white movie stars) is black women. There are no movies about black women in the Top 20 box office or Tomatoes list. The best you get is probably Amanda Waller.\n\ninb4 my free-time original research for a Reddit post has an error or two in identification or classification of the main character of movies I've mostly not seen.

{"body":"Klorp’s office was located in the darkest, dampest corner of the Exo-Humanoidology’s building’s basement. He sat in silence, his life’s work in shambles. He had been so excited to write his dissertation on humans; Earth had shown so much promise! Their cultures were far more diverse than his own species, and the short lifespan of the humans meant that the styles of art and music they generated were constantly and rapidly evolving. They even resembled his own species to an extent, closely enough that with some minor cosmetic surgery he could even have potentially lived among them and studied them more closely. Several probes from the fledgling species had been captured. On each probe that was found, the humans had written a message for any interstellar beings it might encounter. \n\nThose messages were what originally drew Klorp to humans. They were written so carefully, they recognized that math was the only language that everyone would understand and endeavored in a rather elegant way to convey the state of their progress with simple dots and lines. They always included pictures and music, showing that they were also a social society who spent as much time stimulating their senses as they did studying the universe around them. The probes seemed to scream, “We are here! Come teach us, come learn!” \n\nThe message on the most recent probe was different. A simple data storage device was included. After several weeks of collaboration with his university’s archeology department he was able to access the files included. There were thousands of them! Novels, pictures of art and architecture, music! They had included a treasure trove of their culture. With shaking digits, Klorp opened the first file, a painting by a man named Joseph Ducreux. No painting opened, instead a video started playing. The loud music assaulted Klorp’s ears. “Never gonna give you up! Never gonna let you down!” Klorp shut the video off. He wondered if the humans had made a mistake. He selected the next file, a news article titled, “14 tax reforms you won’t believe congress just passed!” \n\n“That crazy Congress, what have they done now?” Klorp asked, chuckling to himself. He activated the file only to have that same video play again. Each file was like that, every file, all of them directed Klorp back to the same video. A short man in a trench coat dancing and screaming about knowing rules and not being a stranger to love. It was insufferable. Klorp wondered if the humans knew their error. He activated one of his remote satellites he had orbiting earth. He scanned the planet’s communication network for any mention of mistakes in the probe’s construction. The most prominent result was an article titled, “If you’re an alien and you’ve found our probe ‘Voyager’ click here for the actual message.” Activating that link directed him to the same video. The same red-headed bastard was screaming at him again. \n\n“What is this? Why is this happening?” Klorp asked himself. He spent the next few weeks on the internet, trying to understand why this one joke was considered to be the funniest thing to ever have happen in the history of the planet. How could it be that such a rich, vibrant world had fallen so far into such a state that they spent billions of dollars trying to troll aliens.  Aliens they didn’t even know about, mind you. \n\nKlorp seethed with anger. If he attempted to present his dissertation, “The Boundless Possibilities of the Human Race” at this point he would be a laughing stock. No one would ever take that planet seriously again, and very few would ever take him seriously again. He decided there was only one option. He activated his communicator and contacted a cosmetic surgeon. It nearly drained his credits, but the surgery was a success. He gazed at himself in the mirror and he almost looked human. His skin was a shade or two too orange, his hair implants were a little wild, but they had to be to hide his antennae. \n\nHe climbed into his gold-plated ship and launched towards earth. Gold was abundant on his planet, and it was used extensively in all sorts of construction. He knew it was rare on earth, and that when he landed the raw materials would provide him with the resources to take his revenge.\n\nSlowly his plan came to fruition, he became more and more popular. Never had a person acted so ridiculously, never had they faked so much success. Ten earth years ago it would have been crazy to even imagine that this would work, but if the world had fallen to the state where a video of a tiny man in giant sunglasses singing was the height of comedy, then just maybe it had fallen to a state where they would put their trust in an idiot. \n\nAn eye for an eye is much more literal on his planet. True justice requires that the offender be offended back in kind. Finally he would be able to repay those fucking internet trolls for ruining his life’s work. Finally there would be some justice in his life. He had prepared the biggest troll the planet had ever known. He even took a human wife and had her subtlely “Rick Roll” a global audience as an appetizer for his own, impending satisfaction.\n\nHe smiled at how far he’d come, at how close he was to completing his scheme. He walked out on stage in front of thousands of screaming fans. He approached the podium and shouted, “Let’s Make America Great Again!”\n","score":"20","subreddit":"WritingPrompts"}
