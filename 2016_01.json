{"body":"Hi! Here is my recommendation list for you and I hope this will help!\n\n* SolidWorks - is almost an industry standard. I am personally pro-efficient with SolidWorks already even without formal training, which means it has a good intuitive user interface and great community support. It is very rich in features as well. Too bad it costs several thousand dollars. (if you are actually a student, learning SolidWorks is highly recommended, try to obtain an education version)\n\n* Autodesk Inventor is almost on par with SolidWorks with very similar features. I’ve tried it briefly. I simply do not have a reason to switch to Inventor from SolidWorks.\n\n\n* SolidEdge was used at one of the places I worked for. It’s not bad but definitely doesn’t shine above the other contenders in this classification.\n\n\n* Onshape claims to be created by the creators behind SolidWorks. What makes it special is that it runs in the browser using WebGL (it can also run on mobile devices this way). It has many collaboration features, version control (like git), and even real-time multiple user collaboration (just like Google Docs). Designs are saved online, but it can also import and export a wide variety of formats, including STEP and even SolidWorks. \n\n\n* It certainly feels like a really lightweight SolidWorks. It is a “parametric feature-based solid modeler”, with support for assemblies. It isn’t missing anything in a way that I would consider a show stopper. Their business model is somewhat similar to GitHub. If you want to use Onshape for free, you are limited to 5 private files but unlimited number of public files. If you pay them a monthly subscription, then you can have unlimited number of public files and manage multiple users within an organization. Onshape is currently in public beta and I encourage everybody to try it out.\n\n\n* Autodesk 123D meets these criteria. The disappointment is that it is not “feature-based”, so the workflow might take a bit longer than using SolidWorks. It’s good to pre-plan your model really well before bring it to the 3rd dimension. (think about how to make your object in a “subtractive” method first, as if you were carving it out of wood, my point is: you don’t have many opportunities to fix mistakes)\n\n\n* Autodesk Fusion 360 is very similar to 123D but with more features. It is more forgiving than 123D in terms of letting you edit the thing you already created (it is sort of “feature-based”). It is It is free only for certain people, but hobbyists are apparently included so yay for that. It can import from and export to a ton of file formats. The paid version isn’t outrageously expensive.\n\n\n* DesignSpark Mechanical is similar to 123D, but with more focus on electronics and pushes products from “RS Components International”. It can export to DXF but not STEP, so it is not completely recommended (the DXF contains lines in 3 dimensions but does not describe solids, you end up with a wireframe model if you try to import it).\n\n\n* Cubify is feature-based and parametric with an interface that can compete with SolidWorks. It is cheap enough to recommend, except it only saves/exports to 2 file formats, a proprietary format and STL. If it cannot export to STEP or DXF (or similar) then I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it. Their customer support stated that there are no plans to add that feature. (I should note that importing STEP is supported, just not exporting)\n\n\n* SolidFace is feature-based and parametric with an interface that looks like somebody just stole SolidWorks icons and changed some colors, but the actual UI layout is terrible, and depends on a lot of keyboard commands. I couldn’t figure out how to edit the length of a line I just drew. I would not recommend this software.\n\n\n* OpenSCAD, and similar languages, are great when they are really applicable to your specific situation. But if you are a newbie, do not start off designing stuff using code as a learning step!\n\n\n* OpenJSCAD is like OpenSCAD except in JavaScript and can run in a browser. I do not do much “organic” modelling. I hear that Blender is a good free program. Personally, I’ve used Rhino 3D back when I was in high school.\n\n\n* Geomagic is basically the old Alibre Design, except now they belong to 3D Systems. It’s in the same class as SolidWorks. (Note that Cubify is also owned by 3D Systems and has a backend based on Alibre Design)","score":"2","subreddit":"3Dprinting"}

{"body":"In my opinion it doesn't matter who released this poll, at this point it's a significant outlier regardless of the source.  They're basically indicating a 10+ point shift in support in a very short period of time, a period of time in which nothing really happened to justify any shift.  Was there a new Clinton scandal?  Did Bernie deliver an amazing debate performance, or wildly successful speech?  ...no, so why, if this poll is accurate, was there a shift?  This just doesn't happen without some kind of reason.  So I'll wait for more polls to come out.  I've always followed the rule that with this type of data a single poll doesn't mean much, but an aggregate can tell you trends.\n\nThat said, I checked [Real Clear Politics](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html) and noticed something.  This isn't the first poll they've released, but look at the others.  The last one they released was for the dates 11/30 - 12/4, they found Clinton +18 despite the average at that time being Clinton +26.8.  8.8 points under average.  Next one was for the dates 10/24 - 10/29 when they found Clinton +15 despite the average at that time being Clinton +21.8.  6.8 points under average.  The one before that was for the dates 9/26 - 10/1 when they found Clinton +20, though that one was when her average was +16.6.  I'm not going to sink to /r/politics level and throw out the poll simply because it doesn't align with what I'm hoping is reality (nor will I massage the data), but I think it's clear this polling agency still has issues.","score":"3","subreddit":"hillaryclinton"}

With full defence he was hitting for 100-300 with his abilities, which Yuna could heal through no problem (although did have a close call where SG ran out and he inferno me before refresh completed casting)\n\nThe counterattacks were also not that bad with full mitigation and lure.\n\nI messed up near the end, lost count of his turns and so mis-timed the steal power, and ended up accidentally healing him and wasted a steal power...this could have cost me because he turtled near the end, and I had no steal power left, but squalls blasting zone was up, so Rubicon got fried.\n\nI dont think this is as much a RNGfest and is more making sure you have correct timing on abilities. You've got to be proactive and pre-emptive, than reactive in this fight more so than others\n\nAnyway main recommendations from me is stack up best res gear, get timings correct on mitigation and steals, and the rest is a bit of luck. One thing to note, is that without an AOE SB I couldnt do this, I tried Aeirth because I have PP, but she couldnt heal up enough, and I didnt need the damage boost that much anyway.\n\n","score":"1","subreddit":"FFRecordKeeper"}

{"body":"In the past 7 days I have hit a new high for Tinder dates, four in a week, and some of these have caused me to ask a few questions you might be able to answer. \n\nFirst a bit about me, I am going to College, live in a College town, marathon runner and I am short, 5’4” (which might affect the dates). \n\nGirl/Date #1 Matched several times, from deleting and re-creating accounts but finally meet up for some coffee and had a good enough time to schedule hanging out again. Tried to bring the date back to my place but she said she wanted to get to know me more first. I didn’t go in for a kiss even though I felt the vibe so I am regretting that a bit still. \n\nGirl/Date #2 Oddest date out of the bunch. Again coffee, we talked for a while and had a solid time but I kept getting a friend vibe. When we parted ways it was very obvious that we wouldn’t see each other again and never even went for a hug goodbye.\n\nGirl/Date #3 Easily the highlight of the dating week. We had texted for quite some time and when she asked about my height over text I told her the truth. She was disappointed and said that was a deal breaker but would still be down to meet up for coffee. My first pity date I thought!\n\nWell we meet up for coffee, and after a short time head to my place. We put on Netflix and start making out and after some time move things into my bed.  She has a great body and nice perky breasts. However, she wont let me take off her pants, just touching through jeans. She says, I would think less of her if we went further, and wont budge even after I say otherwise. She goes home after 4 hours at my place and we arrange for another date this week. \n\nSo I guess that means height didn’t matter as much as she lead on since we seem to text a lot even after the date and get along well. (Right?!?) Should I bring height back up again to make sure her view point has changed or just let it die? \n\nGirl/Date #4(cancel girl) Had this date lined up which I was iffy about since I wasn’t too attracted to her. Well I ended up cancelling since I just wasn’t feeling it but gave her a good days notice so I didn’t feel too bad. \n\nGirl/Date #5 Just happened today, and we meet up for coffee and talked for almost 3 hours and things seemed to be going well. Ending was a bit strange since neither of us said we should hang out again so I am not sure where to go with this, but ended with a hug goodbye. I sent her a text saying I had a good time and that we should do it again (just sent it so no text back as of yet) but I have the same feeling I did about Girl #3 that it wont go anywhere. She was also a fair amount taller than me so that might have something to do with it since she seemed to laugh a lot and there was no awkward silences. (she texted back she had a great time, but no second date has been made :/ )\n\n\nWow, that was a longer write up then I thought it would be. \n\nAny advice here for Girl #5 or advice on how to stay away from making future dates turn into friend dates like Date/Girl #3 and possibly Girl #5? \n\nTL;DR – Went on a few solid dates, and possibly two dates that turned into ‘friend’ dates. \n","score":"34","subreddit":"Tinder"}

Right now they manipulate talent to fit into their dated format, where really they should be manipulating the format to better fit and showcase their stars. The outdated show seems to be more important than its currently restricted held back talent. \n\nThere needs to be women co-main eventing, just like NXT, where both women's NXT championship and men's NXT championship are both equal and rightly so.

{"body":"Please, please hang in there. I can't say my situation is exactly like yours, but both of my parents have said some variety of \"I can live without you\"/\"I don't love you\". My father said this out of rejection after I chose to live with my mom when they divorced. My mother said this during an addiction to drugs. No matter the situation, they didn't mean it. However, it hurt. Especially being a kid, your parents aren't supposed to hurt you like that. But whether or not your father means it shouldn't have an influence on how your view your life. What if someday after showing continued success, your father has to admit to himself that he was wrong? Wouldn't that be amazing? You shouldn't live your life based on how your dad expects you to live. If he sees you as a failure, it doesn't mean you are one. Why would you let someone who has such a disordered way of thinking dictate how you view yourself? You can't chose your family, as another redditor mentioned here, but you can choose how they effect your life. And your life is so, so precious. Sensitive people have a special way of thinking and could have a lasting impact on the world. I'm sure after this 'altercation', your mind is racing with so many thoughts and emotions. However, after you organize your mind and find how valuable you are, you'll see that your life is worth living for a lot of reasons. And you'll find that after rising above this, you're a better person for it. You know you'd never treat your son this way, let alone another person. You know that there are people out there that struggle emotionally and socially and you have the ability to be sensitive to them (which is something that is greatly lacking in today's society). Already you prove to be a better man than your father, if you measure success in emotional development  (which I definitely do). If you ever need to talk, please PM me. Your life is important. So please, please hang in there. Life will get better, I promise. It did for me.","score":"2","subreddit":"socialanxiety"}

Wells in the Carrot Creek area and Niton Junction area have been \"searched\" i.e., as much as RCMP can without a warrant, so most of the wells on private properties have not been searched to my knowledge. There's no solid evidence that is leading to the idea of dumping the bodies in a well - it just makes sense since the areas in and out of Edson are farm lands. There's always been talk around the town when this happened in the summer of 2010 about how Vader had a REALLY bad rep as just a horrible and scary guy. He has a huge criminal history and I'm pretty sure he was a heavy meth user (Edson is the crystal meth capital of Western Canada - we're so proud!) and he was known as a violent guy. \n\nThe evidence against him is pretty damning, though. I mean he was found in possession of their SUV, had been seen around the area driving it before the burnt out RV was discovered, and now there's DNA evidence.. Vader clearly did it. This guy has been screwing with the CJS, the charges are constantly dropped, he keeps getting released on bail. It's insane. This case has haunted me for years and I hope he will finally be given jail time. Sadly I don't think their bodies will ever be found, but hopefully he will be charged in their deaths despite that.

{"body":"Ofc its Oculus desire to make VR affordable, but when you negotiate with your producers and suppliers that you depend on for mass prodcution of all necessary components, negotiation that normally concludes very late at the very end shortly before production starts, sometimes you are not getting exactly those conditions that you want, especially if you are not a company that is shifting units in sizes like Apple. There's a lot of competition fighting for production allocation in display production, I assume other elements are also hard to get by due to the overlap with Smartphones, so getting a customized display for a run of a couple hundred thousands units might simply not be that much of an interesting business proposition to producers, if you are on tight margins and your factory needs to run 24h a day best with no interruptions. Even with a partner of Samsung, that might simply going to cost you.\n\nThe problem is that people somehow fell victim to Oculus marketing campaign that the VR revolution is going to happen right now and you all will be part of it. Which builds tremendous hype and expectation. This is not exactly true, the revolution will happen gradually if the technology is absorbed by the mass market, there will be countless companies fighting to get a bite at this market, before there will be consolidation and the tech is finally matured enough to be affordable to everyone.

Since not only is 100% of in demand hardware produced in the States or China (who use USD pricing), but many Canadians also look for American e-liquid brands at their local reseller shops. \n\nI'm very appreciative of people who order within Canada and help the industry grow. There might be a little bit of a premium price on things but usually only a few extra dollars after comparing the exchange rate for personal purchases.\n\nI know we've personally had to make some hard decisions recently about staffing and our own personal take home, and have more decisions in the future we're hoping don't become an issue but it's hard to say for sure.\n\nVendors have definitely done a great job weathering the storm thus far, prices do seem fairly stable. But there's been some increases across the board in general among vendors, not communicated or arranged but just a mutual silent understanding.\n\nFor the moment I know Vapor North will stick around, but I do worry about the future of vaping and other shops.

You stand to pay a small amount more for a pack buying in store, but knowing you've got a good fit is worth that price IMO. Most packs don't deviate much, and if you count in-store returns it could be worth it. \n\nHowever, you really only need to get fitted for bag that'll have to ride off your hips for support. Other than a mountain climbing bag or straps to hug you so your bag doesn't flop around as you run, I see no reason for a 30L bag to have hip straps. You shouldn't be hauling that much weight around to warrant the support. So as long as the shoulders fit (which, generally, they should fit anyone), you should be fine. \n\nIf you're just packing what I recommended above, I think the Osprey Momentum 30 (or the Ozone 35) is one of the best bags you can buy. Simple shoulder straps, light and compact for easy travel. If I was going to travel without camping gear, that's what I'd choose. My only gripe is the shoulder pocket.

It's perfectly acceptable to take other supernaturals as Allies, such as Allies (Invictus) or Allies (Blood Talons), so Spirits shouldn't be much different - so long as the mage can reasonably communicate with the Spirits via the Spirit Arcana or the Spirit Tongue merit. For example, with \"Allies (Forest Court)\" you might call in favors involving it's domain in the Shadow, or *maybe* convince the Spirits to use their Influence in the real world.

(Houston must have a ton of QBs that are about to fall off the tree.)\n\n   OR\n\n3)  Lands an over-the-hill HoF QB on a vanity contract  (1 yr, lots of money).  Yeah, maybe Manning's or Brees or Rivers, etc. accuracy may be declining at this point, but they must be looking at the Jets receivers and o-line and think to themselves, \"this is my shot\".   Just think what could be done with a QB that can go through read progressions.  Unfortunately, because of Gailey's spread, the QB should be mobile, and that may preclude some of them.\n\nThe only way the Jets draft a QB this year is if BPA falls into their lap, and I don't think any QB in this years draft is even worth drafting.  My guess is that Bowles need for speed gets accommodated, and the 1st pick will be an edge rushing OLB, and 2nd round will either be an o-lineman or an ILB that has good lateral speed for coverage (or even another CB, if Milliner \u0026amp; McDougle are truly in the doghouse).

{"body":"I don't think the end-times are a good reason to quit college. ;) Even the Jews in Babylon were asked to keep working for the good of the city. If it really is the end-times (which nobody can be for sure) nobody is going to be helped by christians in retreat. I'd advice you to become a valuable member of society and show Jesus' love from that position. You've not been given opportunities and capabilities to not ise them. Think about what your talents and interests are, and how you could use them. It really might be the case college is not for you, but be sure about it. Also, are you sure it's college that is keeping you away from God, and not other things, like prestation stress, the lack of social contact, or maybe even your brain's unhappiness wit nofap?\n\nShort:\nNobody knows what the future holds. I personally expect god wants many billions more people in his kingdom, and that is why he's been waiting for almost 2000 years already. Other people look at 'the signs' and think it is soon (carefull, though, because some of these people seem to take their interpretation of bible parts more serious than they care about Jesus), but those groups have existed in nearly every generation since Christ.\nThink about your given talents, opportunities and interests and choose a path that fits best with that. It might well be becoming a preacher or missionary, it might also be studying science or making art.\n19 years is young (said the 25 year old). When I was your age (said the 25 year old) I hadn't found nofap yet, and I just started a new study after failing two other studies. I finished that one, am no doing a masters, busy with making a company, and hope to be working on a phd in a year or so. My point is: things change, and if the path ahead seems to be going in the wrong direction, don't be afraid to choose a different path that you expect to work for you (but when you do, give it your best).\n\nFollowing the Lord is good. But you definitely seem to need some friends. I'd be surpised if your college or city doesn't have some sort of christian student organization that organizes bible study evenings or something similar. Looks like a good place to make friends.\n\nOh, and the last point: finding a job and getting low pay every month MIGHT cause more stress than you are in now. If you do this, first find a job (that pays enough) and THEN quit college.\n\nAlso, some time management and study tips could help you a great deal with reducing stress. I have had a study partner for a while with whom I would study in shifts of 45 minutes and then have breaks of 15 minutes. Those were the msot productive days of my student career.\n\nSo, a long story ful of tips. I hope they're useful to you. Personally, I hope you won't quit studying, but you are a better judge of your situation and opportunities than I am. Don't forget to pray a lot the next few days. I will pray for you too, that God may guide you!","score":"4","subreddit":"NoFapChristians"}

{"body":"Hi there! I think I was in a similar situation to you when I was considering university courses six years ago. My mother is ESTJ, and is sounds like she thinks fairly similarly to your parents. I knew from the outset that I wanted to do an arts/humanities degree, and she would regularly express concerns about how I would be able to manage financially, if I could ever get a job, etc. But I did it anyway because I knew it was what I wanted, and on the side I worked really hard in various volunteer roles because I knew I wanted to work for a non-profit organisation in the future. I finished my degree at the end of 2014, took an internship for the first half of the year, and ended up in my first job shortly after that.\n\nAlso, be aware - your financial needs may be significantly different from your parents, especially if your parents are the type of people who have a more expensive lifestyle. (As my mother is. =)) It was interesting the other night, we were out to dinner and my mother finally acknowledged that I didn't need a job that paid me especially well because I had other priorities and don't want the sort of lifestyle that she has.\n\nIn a nutshell, my advice to you is to develop a vision for what you want to pursue career-wise. It doesn't need to be a singular vision that you commit to the whole of your life - things have definitely evolved over time for me (i.e. I wanted to go into academia before I did my final research year, which was great but very stressful, so I decided to go into the workforce instead. More recently, I'm starting to think about what post-grad study I would want to do, and what different paths I may want to follow.) But what you need to do for university is figure out what you want to study, and a pathway to a career that you think you will enjoy. (Personally, I appreciated having a couple of different options from my approach, such as further study/academia, or working in a couple of different fields.) Knowing what you want and being determined to get it will make it easier to stand firm in the face of your parents pressure. Figuring out what you want can be a process which takes a bit of time, but I think it's really important and rewarding.","score":"1","subreddit":"infj"}

Concerns about the reduction in hydropower are overstated:\n\n\u0026gt;This modest reduction in electrical power output is less than 1% of the renewable power being installed to meet California’s Renewable Portfolio Standard of 33%. See Cal Public Utilities Code § 399.15. CCSF’s Kirkwood, Moccasin and Holm Power Plants are all in excess of 40 MW and are not considered renewable under California’s RPS standard. See PUC Code § 399.12(e)(1)(D)(i). Any loss of hydropower could be replaced with\nalternative power sources.\n\nAlso, there's no dispute that the Tuolumne River provides clean water to millions of people. The lawsuit isn't asking San Francisco to be cut off from accessing this water. It's merely challenging the *method of diversion*, which currently requires a mega-reservoir (for a lack of a better word) in Hetch Hetchy Valley and which is no longer necessary, especially because it's not the 1920s anymore and there are plenty of other reservoirs downstream that can collect and divert the same water that the city needs from the same river. Sure, it will take some money and effort to reorganize the infrastructure. But San Francisco will get the water it's always received, even if the dam is removed. It's tragic knowing that, during our lifetimes, we will never witness and enjoy Hetch Hetchy as it was meant to be, which, by all historical accounts, was as grand and majestic as Yosemite Valley. But, at the least, we can begin the process of restoring the valley for the enjoyment of future generations. ","score":"1","subreddit":"TrueReddit"}

Nobody ever polls Alaska.\" \n\nI'm glad to say I was wrong.\n\nAt any rate, Alaska will be part of Super Tuesday for the Republicans (late March for the Dems) and fortunately the Alaska Daily News with a couple of different scenarios, since caucus turnout may be hard to gauge in the 49th state.\n\nFor the Republicans, a heavy party-only turnout makes a much tighter race. Trump is still favored over Cruz among registered Republicans but only by about 4 points (28/24).\n\nSimilarly for the Democrats, a turnout more geared toward registered Dems favors Clinton: She leads Sanders 44/41 among party members only.\n\nOf course in Alaska well over half of registered voters (55%) are undeclared, so there will likely be plenty of independents participating in the caucuses which should make Sanders and Trump fairly strong favorites in Alaska at this time.","score":"3","subreddit":"Forecast2016"}

It’s incredible to watch him hold an infant when I know he could pick up a car :O he is always gentle with people as well, and is the man that his friends reach out to when they are in trouble because he will tell it like it is, but in such a compassionate way. He does this with me too which is such a gift.\n\n*2: His hunger to learn everything.* And his ability to apply it to the real world. He takes in so much from his classes, his work, watching the news, any and everything.. it challenges me to constantly be learning too, and our conversations never get boring because of it. \n\n*3: He knows me better than I know myself.* Once we were playing Cards Against Humanity with a big group of friends, and he won because literally every. single. time. it was my turn to choose, I chose the card he put down. He just knows my sense of humor that well :P and that goes for much bigger things too. I know I can trust his evaluation of me even when I am panicking or lost in feels haha. \n\n*4:  His approach to sex.* I came into the relationship with some bad hangups and he has been exactly the right mix of patient, seductive, explanatory and exploratory. He is so selfless in the way that he makes love that I just want to please him even more, and then he wants to please me, and then it just keeps going in the best ways :) \n\n*5: His long-term view of the world.* In his early 20s, he is already laying the groundwork for a good retirement, preparing for a family, and saying things like “let’s work toward moving to this place because we could farm if food chains start collapsing.” While I’m over here like “oh but this house has such a pretty front!” Lol.

That's what businesses do, and if they didn't, they'd go out of business and their corner-cutting competitors would take their market share.

{"body":"Thanks! This was very helpful. One point though: \n\u0026gt;his would put the Saxons arrival in Britain not as invaders but instead as Roman soldiers/mercenaries working for the Roman state during the late 4th century, who then were able to assert themselves as a powerful force in the chaotic decades that followed the collapse of Roman power. \n\nThere is absolutely no reason to think that Saxons were all working for the Romans. Or that they weren't invaders. We know that there were invasions going back to at least the 290s. This is why the Romans began to fortify the shore at that point in time. Previously their fortifications were to ward off attacks from what is now Scotland and Ireland. But these fortifications were facing Gaul. They were fortifications to ward off invasions from mainland Europe. And some have suggested the Romans allowed some of them to settle on the shore to protect from other invaders (something they did with the Goths to be a first line against the Huns elsewhere) but there is no way of proving that. \n\nSaxon occupation in Britain during the time of Roman occupation does not necessarily mean they were working with the Romans or even approved to be there. Roman presence in Britain dwindled from the time of Constantine on. Until eventually it just disappeared. They could only do so much as they began facing attacks on all sides. \n\nThere were both wanted and unwanted Germanic entry into Roman territory through out the empire during the 300s. We can't just assume the Saxons were welcome. Or that they were unwelcome although the fortifications on the Saxon shore suggest *someone* was unwelcome. Saxons could have been brought in as the first line against those unwelcome people. Or they could have been the unwelcome people. \n\n","score":"1","subreddit":"AskHistorians"}

This is another signature victory for the team at Humane Society International/India, and it caps a recent streak of successful court victories that will save animals ranging from bulls to roosters to songbirds.\n\n\u0026gt;* Some practices are rooted deeply in tradition and religion, or are a core component of festivals, which makes these activities difficult to uproot or dislodge.\n\n\u0026gt;* The fight against Jallikattu in India was won in 2014, when the Supreme Court banned the event as violating the nations anti-cruelty laws, but this year the central government attempted to reinstate it, citing its traditional significance.\n\n\u0026gt;* In the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, where fighting roosters is a popular sport during the harvest festival, HSI/India won a long-fought battle against an attempt to lift a Supreme Court ban on cockfighting.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nHere are some other news items:^credits ^to ^u-sr33\n\n\u0026gt; * [Second harmonic generation spectroscopy on hybrid plasmonic/dielectric nanoantennas](http://www.nature.com/lsa/journal/v5/n1/full/lsa201613a.html)\n\n\u0026gt; * [Error 451: New code tells you when websites are censored](http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/GgXHERqafvYC2lFcVSydjP/Error-451-New-code-tells-you-when-websites-are-censored.html)\n\n\u0026gt; * [Web status code tells you when sites are censored](http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/20/web-status-code-for-censorship/)\n\n---\n\n^I'm ^a ^bot ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme","score":"1","subreddit":"india"}

{"body":"The ranking system is just a modified version of all the past ranking systems. When you play arena you want to match people of similar skill, and as you win your rank goes up. bronze, silver and gold are kind of low while platinum, diamond and onyx are higher. \n\nWeapon upgrades and unlockable stuff is only for warzone, which is a new mode. Your team captures bases to use as spawn points and kills enemies and bosses for points, up to 1000. Holding bases also gives you points. Basically, you use req packs (purchased with points or money) to unlock loadout weapons with modifications like sights, increased vehicle damage, and suppressors, as well as consumable items. \n\nIn each match you have a 'req energy' counter. The maximum energy available to you goes up as the match progresses, and you can spend energy on reqs. If I reach rank 3 I can call in a battle rifle loadout instead of a pistol; if I reach rank 6 I can replace that with a DMR. I could also spend the 6 energy on a banshee, which would consume the energy. I stay at req level 6, but it takes some time to recharge- this prevents spamming your highest level stuff too quickly.

Fire is the result of a chemical reaction, a chemical reaction that produces heat and light. Not all chemical reaction produce heat and light and some only produce heat and some only produce light. Electricity is the result of charged particles either in motion (an electrical current) or not (static electricity).\nIn most cases for a fire to start there must be a quantity of heat energy available to get the chemical reaction started. Once started the chemical reaction can sustain itself until it runs out of fuel or oxygen.\nIn most cases an electrical current will produce heat and if it produces enough heat it can start the combustion process and there is a fire. Static electricity can produce a lot of heat when it discharges. The best example of this is lightening. This too can start a fire.\n\nSo, electricity can start a fire only if it produces enough heat to get the chemical reaction going. But the two, electricity and fire, are still very, very different from each other.\"\n\noverall my point is that they share an inherent RELATIONSHIP with one another and a variety of physical properties as well but that does not make them the same substance","score":"1","subreddit":"TheLastAirbender"}

{"body":"- **McNeese St.**: 5 minutes of hurricane football? I'm counting this as a W just so we can call this a 10-win season\n\n- **Mississippi St.**: closer than I wanted it to be, but happy with the performance given the lack of a \"warm-up game\"\n\n- **Auburn**: 2 games into the season and we're already 2 games into conference schedule; this is unnerving, but we handle it very well, especially considering Auburn's preseason hype\n\n- **Syracuse**: Ok, it's time to actually get some passing practice in and really flex our muscles. Wait...this isn't going how I thought.\n\n- **Eastern Michigan**: Ok, seriously this time, let's give Harris some time to shine. EMU's terrible. ^^*sigh* Why is it still a one-possession game at the end of the half and the end of the 3rd?\n\n- **South Carolina**: Lots of off-the-field drama with the game being relocated and a lot of our players having had personal experience with this kind of thing. A good dominant performance.\n\n- **Florida**: Our first real test. Nerve-racking back-and-forth game, in true Cardiac Cats style. And it's clinched the only way an LSU-Florida game can be: fake kick ran in for a TD.\n\n- **Western Kentucky**: We know we're still not gonna get to see Harris throw, but we finally get to see the power with his feet. After another slow start against an inferior team (although, obligated to classify them as one of the best G5 teams), a 34-14 second half felt good. Nonetheless, with Alabama looming, we all know this LSU tradition of not finding their rhythm until the second half isn't going to fly against the Tide...or the Razorbacks...or the Rebels...or even the Aggies.\n\n- **Alabama**: As expected, we're finally exposed as the one-dimensional team we are. But it's ok, it is Alabama after all, no one in the country can stop them most times; we'll still be able to manage the next 3 games and still be in good standing.\n\n- **Arkansas**: ^^*sigh* Every. Damn. Year. It doesn't matter what Arkansas' season has looked like up to this point, LSU can't do anything against them. I mean, cmon, their only decisive wins this season were against UTEP and FCS' UT-Martin. Not to mention, the blueprint for stopping us was laid out the week before and we still refused to make fundamental adjustments in game plans.\n\n- **Ole Miss**: Ok, I've accepted my fate that we're not going to throw it even though we need to, but is it too much to ask for \u0026lt; 100 yards in penalties?\n\n- **Texas A\u0026amp;M**: Tons of mixed feelings between the 0-3 run we had going, the Les Miles drama, and the albeit small streak we have going against the Aggies (I absolutely love that we were - and still are - the only SEC-W team they haven't beaten). In the end, not a clean or pretty game by any means, but damn did it feel good on each and every one of the aforementioned accounts.\n\n- **Texas Tech**: We haven't prepared well for bowls games AT ALL lately and this is definitely the fastest team we'll play all season and who knows how much conditioning is going to come into play. However, I was quickly reminded how terrible Tech's defense was. Felt great to end the season on such a positive note.","score":"3","subreddit":"CFB"}

It's in Swedish but the main point is a quote in English:\n\n\u0026gt; ”In essence, we have seen the rise of a large class of ”zero marginal product workers,” to coin a term. Their productivity may not be literally zero, but it is lower than the cost of training, employing, and insuring them. That is why labor is hurting but capital is doing fine; dumping these employees is tough for the workers themselves – and arguably bad for society at large – but it simply doesn’t damage profits much. It’s a cold, hard reality, and one that we will have to deal with, one way or another. ”\n\nI dunno how much you guys have read about this but the gist is these workers are if they are natives addicts, people with mental disorders or someone who hasn't even done the 9 compulsory years of education etc. but he argues that the same effects causes a majority of the LFPR gap between natives and immigrants. Their lack of human capital makes it impossible to make a profit off of them, thus making them unemployable.\n\nI'm not really convinced of this as the only explanation, at the very least more arguments needs to be added to it why the refugees can't be productive here but can be productive in Afghanistan/Syria/Somalia. He says it is literally impossible for more of them to be employed in our current economy, whilst at the same time not pointing at the factors of why more than our economy being different now.\n\nMy intuition says to me that if there aren't any barriers from laws/regulations someone should be able to make a profit of them, and if it's a matter of laws or regulations it can be fixed. Worst case scenario there can be different laws for people who came here as refugees before they are granted a citizenship after a certain amount of years.","score":"1","subreddit":"badeconomics"}

{"body":"I want to make sure its not just me but I cannot stand CW shows. The only one I semi-watch is the Arrow, which I consider the best out of the CW shows but still not consistently enjoyable. I think the CW has the best premises for its shows such as the Arrow, Flash, The 100, and the multi-super hero one but because of the audience the CW attracts the writing, plot trajectories, and characters are undeniably cliched. I'm a HUGE fan of sci-fi/post apocalyptic material (firefly, serenity, dark matter, basically any space/future/post apocalypse setting I will try to watch). And while the CW take the cake in terms of setting, the actual content of their shows is filled with angsty teen drama and cliched character flaws/conflicts. \n\n75% of the problems in the Arrow could be solved by simple and honest communication between the characters. This is a problem across the board for all CW shows where inner character conflict takes precedence over actual problems like survival, or actual conflict. I disliked The Walking Dead for the same reason, I love the fact they are stuck together in a Zombie Apocalypse and have to survive but the show focuses on weird romantic plots/familial relationships/coming of age cliches and shit that just isn't a priority in a fucking Zombie Apocalypse. \n\nThe 100 does the same thing, it distracts from the real problems at hand to focus on the inter-character conflict, which really could be solved within a few hours if they just sat down and talked. Sure firefly and dark matter both have their share of character turmoil to lengthen the show but the focus is on their adventures/travels/mission. You might have a portion of a few episodes dedicated to a strained relationship or some character conflict but never does it detract from the adventure they are on while the CW has an opposite split of 90% focus on the character turmoil while 10% is dedicated to the adventure.

{"body":"I don't know why Ellis didn't spend more time on this point but I can offer my own reasons for thinking they're linked.\n\nNothing in science - no theory, datum, or method - should be beyond rejection by future scientists. There is no bedrock in using science to justify a belief as each justification has to be justified in turn. At the end of the day, scientists are working with a wonderfully (rather than viciously) circular system of theories and data that ties together most of what we know (the alternatives are that some theories are dogma or that there is an infinite regress of justification - [pick your poison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma)).\n\nSince there is no bedrock to anchor scientific theories, every experiment should be seen as testing the whole background of relevant theories rather than just the hypothesis that's ostensibly in the hot seat. In saying that a hypothesis makes a prediction that can be tested we should be saying that a hypothesis plus *all of these accepted theories* implies that a test will have a specific result. When this result doesn't happen, it's unclear if the hypothesis or the theoretical background is false (*or* if inferring the prediction from them was done wrong). In every case, all options should be on the table.\n\nIn short, science should involve openness to the possibility that any one of the widely accepted theories in a scientific field might be false and this openness is one way that philosophy is inextricably linked with science and ought to be used with it.\n\nAnd this doesn't mean treating every hypothesis that comes along on equal footing with accepted theories - that would be leaving philosophy out of science in a different way. It *does* mean throwing out the idea that science solves problems like a machine, going in with a set of tools to produce an answer. It means those tools are themselves changing as science is done and the process of changing those tools involves philosophy, questioning whether some of those tools even work despite their history of success.","score":"4","subreddit":"philosophy"}

The customer would like to order a birthday cake for her son 5 or 6 years old I don't remember. Then jessy told me about the phone call and she would like to make the cake herself and I said alright go ahead.\n\nThe customer will pick up the cake some hours later. Then jessy made the cake, all decorated and whatnot ready to put in the box. All of a sudden her hand slipped out while she was trying to put it in the box. In the meantime the customer was already in our shop ready to pick up the cake and I just covered for jessy I told the customer that the cake will be ready in about 15 mins, I'm sorry for the wait I apologize. \n\nAt this time jessy was in the back sobbing and her eyes were watery. I said its alright jessy we can make a new one I will help you and I already told the customer to wait for a while. So long story short I just pulled out the pre made cake I made for another customer and jessy and I decorate it and put it in the box and gave it to customer.\n\nJessy was like I'm sorry for what happen and thank you I'm sorry and she just kept apologizing. I said its alright things like this happened.

I have been playing on it a month and I am actually pretty impressed that for the price it is a decent instrument. It is quiet enough nobody will hear you in the other room. No, you will not learn the same techniques that you would on an acoustic and you if you want to grow with the instrument I do not recommend this one.  I have promised myself that after a year of consistent playing on this violin that I am dropping 3-5K on my next instrument and this one will probably not be used much, if at all, after that.  But from what you are saying you are trying to accomplish it sounds like this may be a good fit for you.  \n\nI am not sure if you have any music experience, however, I use the Essential Elements for Strings books and I bought a Fretless Finger Guide as it does not damage the instrument (it adheres, but doesn't use glue).  You will immediately want to buy a chromatic tuner and a shoulder rest (I use KUN because that is what I know from school).  So, when you add all the extras the total kit will be closer to $200. \n\nI hope this helps! I know this sub likes to push the lessons and the nicer violins and I totally agree with their advice. Renting is also a great option that other people may have more experience with.  ","score":"1","subreddit":"violinist"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; Oh man, you're quoting Collin's Easy Learn Japanese? \n\nIs this a problem? Because from what I can see it's a series of audio books by people who know Japanese and seem to be able to teach it rather competently... apparently they're a source worthy of mockery to you, but then any source would be to you wouldn't it; you arrogant prick.\n\n\u0026gt; What does that even mean? Yes, people have different ways of speaking. People have accents and speech in impediments; pronunciation doesn't have to be uniform for it to be important.\n\nSo there's accents and different ways of speaking, pronunciation doesn't need to be uniform... In short, it's not that important; therefore I was right.\n\n\u0026gt; What if I told you several of the people here have also studied the language for a living?\n\nI'd be completely unimpressed. This isn't a competition to see who can make the best argument from authority.\n\n\u0026gt; And you know, if you hadn't tried to be a show-off.. \n\nWhen? At what point did I try to show off?\n\nI turned up in the subreddit, made an intro post. Posted another thread asking if my grammar/kanji was right and made it clear I'm a total beginner (only been learning since October 2015). I'm not going around like some cringe worth Japanophile acting like I know everything. I'm here precisely because I'm hoping the community knows a shit load more than I do. I've responded to a few people, given broad generalisations but never overstepping the bounds because I'm still new to the language myself. I've given advice on how to get started, and I answered a couple of questions about animé and JRPGs; because that's something I do know something about. So where in all that was I trying to show off...\n\nWas it when I said \"One of the good things about Japanese is that pronunciation isn't actually all that important\"? A statement I made in order to reassure and encourage someone else who's just starting with the language. A statement that I'm literally repeating verbatim from other sources who teach Japanese professionally... and a statement YOU FUCKING AGREE WITH!!! \n\n\u0026gt; ...yeah, you're right in that comparatively speaking, pronunciation isn't something that beginner learners of Japanese need to focus on.\n\nSee! You agree... so what's the damn problem?\n\nI didn't come in here and act as though I know everything about Japan or the Japanese language. I didn't make out as though I was some polyglot expert who knows the secrets to learning a language. If anything I was quite humble, and actively threw myself out there knowing I'd make mistakes and probably get things wrong, in the hope a \"Learn Japanese\" community might actually encourage and help people to learn Japanese. What an unreasonable fucking presumption, hey!\n\n\u0026gt; But there's still plenty of cases where poor pronunciation (wrong intonation of words like 雨 and 飴, mispronouncing らりるれる so that it sounds like だぢづでど, failing to pronounce long vowels or small っ correctly so that words like 新潟 and にがた or 東京 and 特許 get messed up, etc., etc.) that can cause confusion or just sound cringy.\n\nOf course their is, it's a language, not the sound of the fucking Clangers. There's a sliding scale between \"pronunciation is vital and getting it wrong changes the meaning of words\" and \"pronunciation doesn't matter at all, you can basically just make it up\". Are you really so stupid that you though the sentence \"One of the good things about Japanese is that pronunciation isn't actually all that important\" meant, \"Fuck it, just make it up\"? No, it means \"As a beginner, you don't need to worry about pronunciation; focus more on just learning the words and phrases, if you get the pronunciation wrong people will still largely understand you\".\n\n\u0026gt; If you don't want to sound like a slurring idiot, yes, pronunciation is important in any language\n\nI've just about learned how to put together a few basic sentences; the average 3 year old in Japan could run rings around me currently. I don't give a shit if I sound a bit slurred at the moment. I'll worry about refining the language once I've learned the basics, and that's how every learner should feel.\n\nIt shit-biscuits like you who make learning a language difficult. Criticising people for not doing it your way, insulting them for not knowing things instantly, and jumping down peoples necks when a relative beginner gives a total beginner some advice like \"don't worry about pronunciation yet\", which was basically the crux of my post.\n\nMy post was encouraging and positive, your responses have been exclusionary, mocking, and frankly pathetic. You just want to put people down and make yourself feel good, which probably means you have very little to feel good about in your real life...\n\n\u0026gt; ...and yeah, this reddit loves to put know-it-all weeaboos in their place.\n\nGood for you...\n\n\u0026gt; You came in with a shitty attitude, starting talking nonsense, and you don't even have the grace to see what an idiot you were.\n\nReally, did I... https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/3zurw6/new_to_the_language_going_slow_but_putting_in/\n\nThat's a shitty attitude in your book is it? To quote my original post...\n\n\u0026gt; That brings me here. I thought it'd be a good idea to try and get to know people here and maybe have some people to practice my Japanese with. I look forward to chatting with you all, and please give criticism, though I'd appreciate it if people could be kind... I'm a total beginner.\n\nWhat an arrogant douche that guy is, being all polite and humble. Admitting he's a beginner, actively reaching out to a community, and being friendly... what a twat he must be!\n\nHave you ever consider /u/SoKratez that you're the fucking arsehole here? That all you've done since I got here is insult and belittle me in every post you've directed at me. For a community that's supposed to be a support network of learners helping each other to learn Japanese, you're quickly proving yourselves to be arrogant, egotistical, elitist pricks who's if anything, just going to turn people away from learning. For every encouraging or engaging post I've had, I've had at least two posts from pricks like you trying to put me down. How does that help anyone or foster any kind of community? Are you actually interested in helping each other learn a language, or do you just want to treat people like dirt on the internet? Because the latter is genuinely pathetic.\n\nSo far, I've been told to go to Lang-8 multiple times if I want help with the language. Trying to engage this community either gets you sent somewhere else, or replies filled with insults and abuse. It's clear this subreddit isn't for people to actually encourage each other and help each other learn; it's for people to wave their ePeen about isn't it... what a pity.","score":"-5","subreddit":"japancirclejerk"}

Finding a cure is simply just not an option. To date there is no cure from the plague. Arthas and Jainas party were only sent to investigate the matter, not fight it. Even with Uthers handful of Paladins it's suicide to wait and act. Waiting for reforcements would take days. It's a lose-lose situation. The only thing they could act upon was to purge stratholme and decrease the size of Scourge forces, something Uther would refuse to see. The other option is to return home, gather more forces and then just purge everything. This is literally Arthas first mission as an Paladin, ofcourse he is not going to be as wise as an old paladin. There are lots of factors to why Arthas acted the way he did. Maybe not the smartest thing to do but there is reason for it.\nI get your point tho.

But instead, I'll give an honest response.\n\n I think this might be a good thing for Monks in the long run, I think Guard was far, far too strong and used as a crutch far too much to prop up Monk tanks of all skills. It broke mechanics, allowed for some really stupid things to happen, and well... Just made other tanks miserable to see their health bars moving while a Monk could effectively have an absorb up that would potentially last the full duration. From personal experience, on a fight like the Hans and Franz it was really distressing having to deal with the Pre-Hotfix Suplex because the Monk would just pop guard and have a 30 second cushion, while I had to time my cooldowns for the last second and hope I did it right so they'd stay... Often I'd just end up curling up and dying because six seconds is not enough time. Or there's times where the monk I tank along side, just pops Guard and does some of the most baffling things that should have killed him but, nope Guard saved the day.","score":"1","subreddit":"wow"}

{"body":"Oh... You're referring to iTunes on the phone, not the OSX/Windows software?\n\nMy bad. In older iOS versions (before iCloud existed) you had to sync your iPhone with iTunes on a computer in order to enable it. I assumed that is what the OP was asking about. In this scenario it is a little cloudier due to app names. iTunes on the iPhone is really just a music/video store but it is by no means the only way of getting music/videos on an iPhone. \n\nThe App Store is a more valid argument, but I believe it is still very far removed from the situation that Microsoft was in during the browser wars. iPhones are very popular to be sure but they are in nowhere near the position that Windows was in during the mid-90s. Android is a hugely successful competitor to the iPhone which offers consumers a very valid choice if they are against the App Store lock in. There was no Android equivalent to Windows.

I've gone up against multiple god awful cheese comps on the PTS and joust and the tips people give you are the exact things you need to be doing. I've dealt with plenty of Isis/Ares/Hun Batz comps and the main thing you have to do is actually what everyone says. You pick a team comp for your team that relies on heavy poke and punish(He Bo is godly for this) and you spread far the fuck out. If they decide to go hard as hell on one teammate, you punish the crap out of them. Thor rift works insanely well for when they pile someone hard because he can hit it from outside their CC and stun them inside of it. The main thing you do is SURVIVE until they blow their cooldowns, and then you go insane on them because what the hell is Ares and Hun Batz gonna do in a single lane once their gimmicks are gone? Die pretty much. You can't just keep saying \"YEAH BUT NO I CANT DO THAT IT DOESNT WORK\" and never try anything new.  \n  \nGood tanks include Ymir(the wall and freeze are godsends) and Athena(your CC is up way more often and instantly rips them off of you or someone else if they go hard). Good mages include any that rely on poke and punish(Isis, Scylla, He Bo) and typically I would choose a damage heavy warrior such as Herc or Bellona.

{"body":"This is another one of those situations that can be helped by things like encumbrance rules and focusing a bit on minutiae. It would be unusual for PCs not to have more equipment than they'd want to or are able to carry all the time. So, what are they doing with the pounds and pounds of treasure and equipment they are leaving behind when they go do whatever?  (Wait, you are telling be that you're going to a meeting with the baton carrying a chest of coins, your alchemy equipment, all of the weapons you own, your tent, camping gear, and a couple changes of clothes? )\nWell, if they don't have hirelings that are willing to permanently camp out then they are looking at either leaving part of the group behind to guard the camp or expending some spells on a passive defense of some sort. If you don't guard your items, then you are either lugging everything you own everywhere you go ( which presents some obvious problems) or your camp becomes a target for thieves or simply wild animals. If you do post guards -especially a group of hirelings- now your camp stands out, becomes a target for law enforcement, and may still be a target for thieves since you clearly have something worth posting guards to protect. If you use magic you are giving up a spell slot or slots, you have to worry about something benign wandering into camp and setting off any traps (like an animal or a lost child), and if you don't set traps then you have the problem of someone being able to defeat your protection spell/s in peace, plus there's the simple matter of magic being detectable and whatever you're protecting looking valuable enough to warrant magic protection and thus becoming a worthwhile target for thieves. \n\nGenerally, I don't see a big issue with a group camping in the middle of nowhere (assuming they have the skills and equipment for it). It can be easy to live off the land in a lot of natural settings. However, living outdoors anywhere near a settled area is a different situation. \nFirst off, there are simply less resources available, and the resources that are available are either owned by someone or are already being exploited.  Think The king's Wood, the fishery that's decimated  by the fisherman upstream, the lumber company that doesn't want people in \"their\" woods, the hunters that any game that is available nearby, and the bandits that don't like the competition. So, hunting for game is going to be difficult and/or unreliable. In short, if there is anything worth having or using near a settlement then someone is likely already possessing or using it. \n\nSecond, simply finding a place to occupy can be difficult, you'll run into the same territorial and resource ownership issues I mentioned above. You'll also run into people or they'll run into you. This is a problem if you've got a king's ransom in gold buried under your tent and your not always there to guard it. Of course, interacting with other people can cause problems (like for instance, if the local beggars catch wind that there's a group in to woods giving away free food). There's also simply the problem of being seen. That can invite a visit from local guardsman or militia (and can lead to violence if they assume that the armed camp outside town is a party of bandits or being held pending identification of they think you're fugitives), attention from thieves and other unscrupulous people, etc. Plus, if your PCs have made any enemies then not being protected by city walls, etc is going to make them much easier to attack, ambush, etc. \n\nFinally, if you are intending to interact with the nearby settlement at all (like to regularly purchase fresh food since hunting isn't sustainable), then you can magnify the problems above simply because you can be seen coming and going, can be followed,  etc. Plus, you are likely making people more curious or suspicious by making it obvious you are hiding out in the woods. You have the additional challenge of the time it takes to get to and from places, which makes things like meeting times a pain for the PCs since travel time to and from town now has to be factored in constantly.

Despite the Arab Spring being the catalyst for the war in Syria, despite months of warfare occurring before a single western nation lifted a finger, despite the fact that there are zero white westerners in any of the rebel groups, it's someone else's fault. \n\nI have seen hundreds, maybe thousands of videos from the war in Syria. You know what I don't see? White western men involved in the fighting. So even though all of the people actually pulling triggers on the ground are Syrian or some other Arab nationality, it's the white mans fault. Even though Syrians kicked the war off themselves, they aren't to blame, all they are doing is the actual killing. \n\nThis excuse, that the west broke Syria, so they are responsible for accepting every brown face who shows up at their borders, falls apart quite easily. Sweden had no part in any war or conflict in the region. Same goes for Austria and other countries. Their \"big business\" has nothing do with the abject failure of Islamic nations to succeed. Even the term big business is nonsense. Coke and Sprite and Microsoft are the reason for the miserable state of the Arab world? Yes that makes perfect sense. Offering products for sale is the real driver behind a millenia of war, not that whole Sunni/Shia thing. So why must Sweden accept Eritreans, Morrocans, Syrians, Afghanis, Turks and everyone else? More than half of these people are not coming from a place even involved in war. Just a place unfortunate enough to be Islamic. \n\nSaudi Arabia actually has tanks on the ground in Syria. They are responsible for some of the deaths and destruction. And yet they are not taking in any migrants. Apparently this excuse only applies to western nations. \n\nIt's bullshit and just another long line of excuses Muslims use to explain their abject failure at this whole advanced civilization thing. \n\nAs far as criminality being a part of human nature, and that the attacks in Europe by immigrants are just human nature, more bullshit. There has never in the recorded history of Germany been mass sexual assault like what occurred in Cologne. This behavior, first seen by the world during Arab Spring in Egypt, isn't normal and isn't just another crime. Attempts to normalize it or imply it's just another crime, are absurd. Before young Islamic males flooded Europe, this particular crime never happened. This not opinion or conjecture. It is a fact, and it was admitted by the chief of police in Cologne. The police did not even realize what was happening, because it didn't even occur to them that people would behave in such a manner. \n\nThe entire world is looking at Europe now, and what do they see as the first contribution of the new Islamic guests? A completely new scale of sexual assault never before seen in these countries. Migrants to a country who haven't even been issued identification yet, but feel comfortable enough to mass together in the hundreds and try to insert their fingers in every orifice of native females unlucky enough to pass by. Boy it's a shocker that these same men are incapable of building a successful nation similar to the ones they are now invading. \n\nThe fun is just getting started. These wonderful men of the religion of peace are going to commit more such crimes, and the native women of Europe are going to watch sex crime statistics fly through the roof, just like Sweden has seen in the past 30 years. \n\nThe so called racists and bigots don't need to do anything to raise protest against the immigrants. The Muslims are going to behave just like they did in their own nation, and the civilized world is going recoil in horror at it. Women will remember a time when they could walk around freely at night without fear of being sodomized by a pack of Islamic hyenas, and will grow to hate all immigrants with brown skin, even the 1 in 10 who is actually a decent person. \n\n\n\n","score":"1","subreddit":"KotakuInAction"}

He was by far the strongest of the living Z-Warriors in the Saiyan arc, he was the only thing that managed to stop 2nd form Freeza until he revealed he could transform again, he had absurd gains in training and reaching almost SSJ tier in the 3 years gap of the Android arc and became the strongest for a while after fusing with Kami, being the only one capable of stopping the Androids at the time. He only became outclassed when the Saiyans focused on surpassing the normal SSJ, but until then, he was top tier all the way through. For a character whose arc was completed in the Saiyan arc, he was relevant throughout almost the entirety of Z, either through power or through character.","score":"1","subreddit":"dbz"}

{"body":"You're looking at this from the idea that skill is equated with MMR. MMR isn't designed to be a direct indicator of skill, MMR is a measurement of likelihood to win a game. There is a correlation between the two, but they're not exactly the same thing. \n\nOf the people you list, including yourself, you all have relatively similar chances to win a game of Dota. Sure, the person who can stack and pull may seem like a significantly more adept at game knowledge than the person who doesn't know what a BKB is. However, if you take all the factors that go into the game...\n\n* mechanics\n* leadership\n* game knowledge\n* picking versus randoming, and picking accordingly\n* ability to find farm\n* item choices\n* even things like what time of day they play... the list goes on and on and on\n\n...these people at a similar MMR pull about the same weight on average to result in a win or loss. Due to the hundreds or thousands of games that they've played, it's simplely not a matter of getting lucky or unlucky with teammates.\n\nSure, it's not a very disirable system, but it's one of the better ways to ensure that both sides have about an equal chance of winning, which is the ultimate goal of matchmaking.","score":"1","subreddit":"DotA2"}

The bartender looks up pauses for a moment and then says \"we don't serve your kind here,\" and gives them the bum rush.  The Bartender was Chinese.  Coincidentally the San Francisco Bay Area reporters guild was having their monthly luncheon at the restaurant attached to the bar and saw the whole thing.  The local FOX affiliate broadcasted something about religious freedom and refusing to serve gays. NBC's angle related to anti-asian bias. CBS thought the story was anti-immigrant, ABC's broadcast was about anti-religious sentiment. PBS had a tasteful piece about Dale Chihuly's glass blowing.  No one bothered to ask the Bartender - who was a devout if liberal Catholic, but it turns out due to an unusual family promise, he had a burning hatred for the Carmelite Order of Nuns. \n\nShit went down. within a few weeks there were protests and counter protests.  The Oathkeepers showed up to keep \"order\" but really all they served to do was draw in the Occupy Wall Street crowd.  Somehow the Taiwanese - Chinese aspect ignited long running tensions in the straight of Formosa. \n\nNews reports were getting grimmer by the day.

In his groggy state the President had forgotten to put on his slippers and didn't see that he was closer to the edge of the hall than he was used to.  It happened.

Why do 1.5 hours of yoga if 30 minutes somehow magically gets you the same results? Like, I can't even imagine how you don't see this.

This is a totally reasonable educated assumption—after all, as recently as 2007 we had public evidence of North Korean nuclear proliferation activities in the Middle East, when Israel bombed a [North Korean nuclear reactor in the Syrian desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Orchard).\n\nNow throw the Iran JCPOA deal into the mix, along with weak efforts to halt the successful North Korean nuclear program, and China turning a blind eye to the use of its runways and ports for North Korean proliferation activities.

Brands include Crosley, ION, Jensen, Pyle, Philco, Innovative Technology, itec, ilive, Steepletone, GPO, and countless more.\n\n* If one component breaks in these devices, there are no serviceable replacement parts (save the godawful sapphire stylus/needle) and fixing them is simply NOT worth it.\n\nRead this website to find out more why they sound horrible: http://www.knowzy.com/Computers/Audio/Digitize_Your_LPs/USB_Record_Player_Turntable_Comparison.htm and watch this YouTube video to get a comparison of a Crosley (which is the same as a Pyle player) and a used, vintage turntable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dtT0-lc7vM\n\nAlso, please look through the links on the right of this subreddit for details if you want a better turntable setup. It's a huge difference from going a cruddy player to even a used, vintage turntable or a newly purchased turntable from the likes of say U-Turn, Audio Technica (LP120 or above ONLY), Rega, Pro-Ject, Music Hall, and others.\n","score":"5","subreddit":"vinyl"}

Not to take anything away from it or their players, but I feel that since F2P the game has changed and I just simply can't enjoy it anymore, even more so since the releases of the rohan region(s). This is just nostalgia speaking, games evolve and so do we, it is logical that some might feel that the game does not cather to their needs anymore.

{"body":"\u0026gt;I think the leaders need to realize that just because you guys keep saying that, doesn't mean that people all of a sudden are going to feel that way. I signed up for competitive tagpro to play competitive tagpro against people of equal skill. It was deemed by the draft that I'm ALTP-B level, so that's where I want to play competitive tagpro matches. I don't care about having fun or going to how to get pup clinics, I care about getting into competitive matches, earning better stats than other players in the same league, and then hopefully that leads to me being drafted higher next season.\n\nI can't speak for the rest of of ALTP, but I do realize this. I am a very competitive person and I've played NLTP for the last three seasons. Not being drafted this season really hurt my pride because I thought that having a hard working and dedicated player with 3 NLTP seasons under her belt would mean more than a Rookie who's been playing TagPro for 3 months. Obviously, I was wrong because of the 224 people drafted into NLTP S6, I wasn't one of them. After about a week of being angry about it, I realized that I'm in ALTP for a reason and if I really do shine, I'll be called up. I threw myself into working on ALTP and for the most part, I think its been pretty great. I'm happy with what I'm doing and where I'm at. I've lagged out of every single half I played last week, but I'm not complaining and I dont think you have room to do that either. You think I want to go to a pup clinic? I know when they spawn. I know how to fight for them. I know all of the things that these people are teaching me because I have played in other leagues. People in NLTP are *expected* to know these things, and even be good at it, and if you can't make it into NLTP, then I really do think that these pup clinics are helpful. Look at it this way: When you're trying out for a NLTP team in a couple of months, whos going to be SOLID on their pups? You are! Because you practiced these things and you'll be an expert by the time the next draft comes around. \n\nI care about my stats too. I was SO excited when I was #18 on the Week 1 Pup stats. Like, holy shit, dude. You dont even understand how excited I was. I told all of my friends and hyped about it to my captain. I might've even posted it in modmail...I'm not sure. But you get the picture. I wanted to see if I maintained my spot on the leaderboard Week 2, but we haven't had the stats because our stats guy was recently replaced. Thats out of both of our control, but I'm really sorry it happened. I asked if I should just take over stats because I'm more than willing to learn about them and do it, but I was told not to because \"I do too much as it is.\" \n\n\u0026gt;I feel like over half the league is the same way, yet you guys keep trying to shoehorn everyone into this \"just have fun and if you complain that it's not competitive you are treated as an outsider\" mold, and I don't really understand why. If there is no competitive tagpro under the NLTP level, then say that so people don't waste their time applying to ALTP next season.\nEDIT, and quick edit, the things that you guys are doing are great and I support it, but I don't see you guys realizing that the help and learning things aren't for everyone. Some of us just want competitive game experience against equal level players.\n\nI agree with you here. We have a lot of really amazing players in ALTP. Between scrims, games, and just spectating in other team's practices, I'm extremely impressed with all the talent we have. I understand that some teams will be far better than others, but the league was built around the idea that newer players need a little more guidance before throwing them into competitive TagPro in NLTP. I don’t think that you’re considered an outsider if you have that opinion because I share and understand your opinion, as do many of the other captains and players in the league. \n\nALTP is a competitive league but has always been had the goal of improving basic skills. If you want to play at a higher competition rate, I strongly suggest talking to a captain in NLTP to get called up because thats where you’ll find a more aggressive league. \n\nI’m sorry that you feel that you’ve wasted your time in ALTP because I have put well over 100 hours into this league. You say that you’re supportive and thankful for everything that we do here, but you continue to criticize our system without any suggestions on how we can make it better. If you do, however, have positive suggestions and want to talk, PM me on your real Reddit account. I’d be more than happy to talk things through with you and at least *try* to get some sort of understanding between us. \n\n\n","score":"2","subreddit":"ALTP"}

{"body":"The Buddha often taught that one should practice Dhamma that is suitable to oneself. \n\nIn his Progressive Sermon he first gave to Yasa (the 6th Arahant of the world, not counting the Buddha) he taught:\n\n1. Danakatha - Charity and good works is essential to living a good, balanced, rewardig and fruitful life\n2. Silakatha - Morality and not doing evil is essential to living a good, balanced, rewarding and fruitful life.\n3. Saggakatha - The result of Danakatha and Silakatha is a heavenly existence. You will be happy and have heavenly pleasures.\n4. Kamadinavakatha - However, there are disadvantages to the advantages gained in Saggakatha. Your happiness will lead to attachment. The subject of your happiness is impermanent so that it is not something that last forever. That is, it will change and it has an expiration date. Therefore, eventually it will run out and so will your happiness. Thus leading to more searching and the need to continue to make more Danakatha, and Silakatha to get back to Saggakatha, which will eventually lead to Kamadinavakatha and so on...\n5. Nekkhammanisansakatha - The benefit of renunciation. Instead of living for happiness, we live for the sake of finding through freedom from the duality which is happiness and suffering. If happiness and suffering are an inseparable pair, then we must forgo happiness to escape suffering. Only through renunciation can we truly be free.\n\nTherefore, from this, we can infer that there are two main stages of practice.\n\nStage 1:\n\nThe doing good stage. \n\nAND\n\nThe refrain from doing evil stage.\n\nStage 2: \n\nThe renunciation stage.\n\nPeople in stage 1 are striving for balance and rebirth. They are not ready for the renunciation stage yet. They are not ready to drop all and ordain and strive for the higher knowledge. Therefore, they should focus on not doing evil and doing good! They will be properly rewarded will good to great rebirths with some suffering intermixed. However, they will have more happiness than suffering since they are doing more good karma than bad karma. \n\nPeople in stage 2 are those who are sick of settling with some bad karma and suffering just for the sake of happiness. They see through the veil of desire and know that they are being fooled by pretty things, only to saddled with debt and responsibility on the back-end. They seek an end to this charade and want to go...NOW. These people already do good and restrain from evil, but they desire not heaven and it's false pleasures.\n\nObviously Stage 2 is more preferred if we had a choice. But you can't force the ripeness of fruit. If someone is not ready, they are not ready. They need to live appropriate to the stage they are at. It is a path people walk and whatever lap you are on in this long lasting race, you should be appropriately practicing based on that lap. Once person might be on 25/500 and feel excited and energetic, whereas, another person is at 485/500 and is fed up and just wants it to be over.\n\nIn this case, I would assume David Bowe was not ready for Stage 2. Therefore his guru gave him the advice to practice Dhamma in a way that was applicable and appropriate for him in that moment, which was to go back and be a musician.\n\nAnother side note, the Buddha never forced anyone to practice. Becoming a monk is hard and you must truly want to. But if you ever feel like quitting, you can say a few words to a fellow monk and poof, you are no longer a monk. He would rather have people who want to be there than to have anyone who doesn't. Joining is hard, quitting is easy. You have to want it to get it.

{"body":"God, your question reminded me of a past troubleshooting headache that took far to long to resolve:\n\nEducational environment, I'm a newly minted and sole netadmin at the main office managing a brand new (var installed) wifi system. I hear reports that one wing of one of the high schools is having \"tons of disconnects\".  Look at the ap, sure enough error rates were ~75% sustained for 240 seconds.  Seriously? It was almost like clock work in the middle of the periods.  I asked the on site tech to get a visual and look for the usual suspects: cordless phones, microwaves, shit tones of bluetooth devices, etc.  \n\nWord comes back from tech, nope nothing going on here out of the ordinary.  Ok, clearly somethings causing problems.  This was a new wifi install, so I thought maybe it was an issue with that, got on the phone with TAC and they pointed me back to environment.  Decide its time I get a visual on site.\n\nSo, I get out to the site in the wing and notice the delicious smell of warm chocolate chip cookies.  It hits me, foods labs.  There's two labs right in the middle of the hall on either side, walk into one, 10 microwaves in it.  Talk with the teacher and sure enough for the past two weeks (remember how I said I was new at this? forgive me) every period they'd been using the microwaves for various food dishes.  They'd use them mid period and they'd set the timers for ~5 minutes on average for w/e they were cooking.  Stick around for a little while and perform a spectrum analysis and the 2.4ghz filled up as soon as the microwaves were turned on.  Maybe they are worse since I swear these microwaves were from the 70's, but it was bad.  That's the day I learned a quite a few things:\n\n* Triple verify your RF for issues\n\n* Get eyes on the environment more quickly\n\n* Band steering is a beautiful thing (pushed all those 2.4ghz clients to 5ghz, boom)\n\n* When told to get a visual, on site tech though that walking down the middle of the hall was all that was necessary, give more explicit instructions to this tech\n\nAnyway, my point is I could have solved this a lot quicker had I been more experienced for sure, but just verify your RF, twice!","score":"6","subreddit":"networking"}

{"body":"The people in charge of the rights are the ones calling the decisions. Netflix currently isn't violating any licensing agreements right now, their users are. They are being pressured by the people who sell them access to content. They are going to come to agreements and set what Netflix can and can't do as a licensee. As I tried to convey, restricting users to a single country is a compromise that still limits their access to the content of every other country. You cut the problem of all access by a significant portion despite the fact that some people are still going to bypass by signing up in the wrong country or watching while traveling. They are never going to lock it down perfectly no matter what they try.\n\nI think people underestimate the technical requirements of bypassing a VPN to detect where the traffic is really coming from.

{"body":"ETFs are Exchange Traded Funds. These funds hold multiple assets, for instance stocks or bonds. An investor can buy shares in these funds to get exposure to the assets which the ETFs hold. This can for example be the S\u0026amp;P 500 index. Since it would be quite burdensome to buy *all* the stocks in the S\u0026amp;P 500, an ETF that holds the stocks of the S\u0026amp;P 500 offers a way to replicate the movements of that particular index in a cheap and convenient way. \n\nAn ETF *should* be valued at same value as the assets its hold. To make this simple. Assume ETF X holds 10 shares in Apple (10 x $97.05 = $970.50) and 1 shares in Google (1 x $694.45). The total *Net Asset Value* would be ($970.50 + $694.45 =) $1,664.95. Now we assume that there 100 shares in ETF X. That would mean each share should represent 1/100th of the total Net Asset Value: 1,664.95 / 100 = ~$16.65 per ETF X.\n\nNow, this ETF may be worth $16.65 per share. But, it's quite conceivable that suddenly someone attempts to buy 50 shares of ETF X. This may cause the price of ETF X go up to $17. Now this is quite an odd situation: if ETF X trades for $17, while the underlying assets are worth only $16.65 per share, there is an opportunity for riskless profit. This happens in two ways:\n\nOn the stock exchange one might short shares in ETF X, and simultaneously buy Apple + Google. Since these assets (ETF X and the underlying) should be prices similarly, you can simply wait for the prices to converge and make a riskless profit. This happens at the stock exchange level. This kind of arbitrage happens between various assets, asset classes and different financial products. \n\nOn a more fundamental level, there is an alternative way to bring ETF X back in balance. This is the ETF creation/redemption process. It works almost the same as the previously described process, but its not entirely similar. Certain (so-called) Authorized Participants are allowed to exchange the underlying shares for newly created ETFs. They may also exchange ETFs and receive the underlying shares. This happens in large blocks, so-called Creation Units. \n\nIf ETF X is too expensive, e.g. it trades for $17 while the underlying assets are worth $16.65, the Authorized Participant can buy the underlying assets, exchange them for ETF X, and subsequently sell ETF X on the market to make a profit. It works the other way too. If ETF X is too cheap relative to the underlying assets, the Authorized Participants simply buys ETF X (driving up the price) and exchange them for the underlying shares. Once again, a risk-less profit is made. \n\nThis happens on a gigantic scale. Not for $0.35, but easily for pennies per trade. Due to the scale and nature of this activity, such firms can, if they are the quickest on the block, make an awful lot of money. ","score":"14","subreddit":"investing"}

There's just 3 simple steps to set up your rideshare and make Bernie proud:\n\n1) Locate and click on the event you wish to attend on [this map](http://www.bernie2016events.org/#zipcode=\u0026amp;distance=50\u0026amp;eventtype=R\u0026amp;eventtype=CW\u0026amp;eventtype=E\u0026amp;eventtype=D\u0026amp;eventtype=B\u0026amp;eventtype=O\u0026amp;daterange=all-events) and then click on the blue “carpool” button on the event popup.  \n\n2) A page will appear with basic instructions that say: *How ridesharing works: Fill out a quick profile. Contact nearby drivers or passengers. Confirm with text/phone calls.* - click to the next page.  \n\n3) Then, just fill out your first name, phone number, and location you’ll be leaving from in the text boxes - and then you’re done with set up!\n\nFor more info on registering and voting in your state, visit [VoteForBernie.org](http://voteforbernie.org/).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your fourth source has nothing to do with any of the points you listed at all.\n\nYour third source is not from a Pew poll at all, as you claimed, but is actually from the Center for Security Policy, which admits that they sponsored the poll they are citing. The Center for Security Policy say themselves that they have \"undertaken several campaigns to expose the threat to America from Shariah,\" so not exactly unbiased when they clearly take such a threat as a foregone conclusion. The first sentence of the Wikipedia article on the Center for Security Policy says it \"has been widely accused of engaging in conspiracy theorizing,\" and the BBC has an article on [just how biased the CSP is](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35037943).

I don't know that any of these have a lasting power, but if they don't stick around, I'm sure they will be replaced with equally interesting newer technologies.\n\nAnd of course, there's Typescript, Dart and even the latest versions of Javascript itself to be excited about.\n","score":"8","subreddit":"programming"}

If you have 5 people represented the left circle and 100 in the right circle, and you draw them to scale so the right one is 20 times larger than the left, how do you make them overlap to show 10% of each sample agree with each other? 10% of the little circle won't overlap with 10% of the large one, so then you've got to make them equally sized, and then you're back to the original problem.\n\nI'm assuming this you-can't-have-your-cake-AND-eat-it-type problem is why we aren't all familiar with a tool for it already ^_^","score":"2","subreddit":"AskAcademia"}

Some deliveries didn't even show up as delivered until 12+ hours after delivery (and that even beyond the 24 hour mark). Some have been marked as delivered within a few minutes of being dropped off. Some have shown up as delivered when they were *technically* delivered... but the package was basically tossed somewhere from the mail truck, or shoved in the mailbox late at night by some lazy dipshit. Luckily, deliveries that made their way to my mailbox hours after the mail delivery had swung by, were under $10, and not important.\n\nIf you can avoid using USPS for anything that matters to you, I'd highly recommend using just about any other delivery service. In fact, I've had better luck with DHL than the USPS.... The only time I'd recommend their delivery is when it's through priority mail, and if the package doesn't get to you, you won't really care.

And he'll get another year to see if he has the ability to play the position.  Kevin pamphile is top-notch depth on a rookie contract.  He plays tackle, guard, and is brought in as a sixth OL on ~20% of our snaps.  He's staying on the roster.  Demar dotson has tons of experience at RT and some at LT.  He was our best OLineman the year before last (pre-injury).  He has a steal of a contract at 1.5m.  He's staying on the roster.  The only way we draft a tackle *anywhere* in the draft is if you think we're cutting gosder cherilus, who has as much running chemistry and experience with our current line as anyone...has more starts at tackle than anyone else on the roster...and was shown a lot of preference at the end of last year (while Dotson was vying for recovery snaps).  I just don't see a tackle being drafted, despite what you'll see from shitty mock drafts by major publications who don't know anything about the Bucs' situation.

{"body":"Unfortunately, the police report will likely be inconclusive. I mean it can't hurt to check it, but it's very unlikely that it will prove one side or the other. \n\nDash cams record to SD card. And they will record continuously as long as you turn it on when you drive. The cam usually creates multiple back-to-back short videos so that all the file sizes are manageable.  Usually you can set the cam up to automatically record over old videos as the card fills up. The one I have, is mounted to my windshield and plugs into the cigarette lighter/car charger. It turns on automatically when I turn on my car. Then I just press the play button. It time and date stamps the video. I just leave it in my car. But I can pop it out of its mount easily.\n\nAmazon sells some nice ones.  A good one will cost a couple hundred or more. But in my opinion, they are well worth it and give peace of mind. The one thing people don't realize is that people lie about accidents the vast majority of the time. We like to think of others as honest. And I think that in other situations, people are honest. But when faced with the prospect of being \"at fault\" and having their rates increase, people will lie most of the time. And sometimes, the other party really doesn't realize that they ran a red light.  \n\nI just received an injury claim from an intersection claim. One vehicle ran the light and caused a multiple vehicle collision.\n\nLuckily my insured had a dash cam and caught the entire thing on video.

{"body":"Deep water becomes a lot less scary with time. I remember on my first trip out the water was dark and murky. A couple hundred feet deep. I was terrified after reading so many sea monster books and hearing the horror stories of sailorslost at sea. But as time went on, you learn to trust your boat. And especially when on more modern boats, the safety features are astronomical.\n\nAs to why I did it, my dad was tired of his job, said he'd saved enough for a boat, and asked if I'd be crew (we used to race smaller boats together when I was younger) I quit my job and we went from Virginia up to Maine, down to Trinidad 2 times. Stopping at a bunch of places between.\n\nAnd for what I did, I just enjoyed it. Good food, good drinks, and every place is different. You can travel 50 miles and have a completely different culture and language. And pretty much everywhere was gorgeous. Plus if you're into Scuba Diving you can see some awesome stuff.\n\nThe crossings to get to places were fun in their own way. Sure, occasionally there was bad weather, but sometimes it's magical. The ocean turns this sort of Sapphire color, plus the green flash (real thing. I didn't believe it until I saw one) and sunsets. One of the things I miss most about it though was nighttime watch. It's quiet except for the sound of the boat and the water. And the stars. It's amazing. There's literally no light pollution for miles. \n\nBut if you're interested in doing for yourself, here's how I recommend you go about it. Learn to sail small boats. Take a couple classes. Get over your fear of water. Then try your hand at bigger boats. If you're ever comfortable past there you can try racing, or become crew for hire on small overnight trips. Once you can do that, try a long trip as crew. \n\nIf you want to know more I can tell you a bit of the day to day stuff, but I think I've been on a tangent long enough. Hope this helps!","score":"2","subreddit":"gifs"}

{"body":"That is a wrong description. It concentrates wealth into the hands of people who increase the wealth of the general population by only a small amount. Like how google has made life a little bit easier for a ton of people. Add up all these little bits together and it makes Larry Page a rich man. \n\nThat is why the system doesn't collapse, and that is why it is not necessarily bad that few people tend to get very rich. They did so by creating tiny bits of value for each person in the general population. So it is not a zero sum game. They did not take wealth away from others. They made the pie bigger. They just got to keep a very large part of that. But without them the pie would not have gotten bigger in the first place. They often took huge risks, or had very rare skills. I do think taxes need to be larger on the very rich though. So I will give you that. \n\nNow it would be a problem if descendants of rich people would only get richer without doing anything. But as I have shown in the above post, that is not exactly the case. Those descendants tend to waste the money, or it is donated at some point to charity. So as these great capitalists die, their wealth tend to dwindle down as time passes. If this wasn't true, the Rothschild family would be worth a trillion dollars today. And I would agree, that that would be a problem. \n\nNow since so many of today's billionaires tend to give a lot of money to charity as well, I do not think this is really a problem.

Not only is that a pretty personal question, but she then balked at my answer (which is pretty irrelevant). She then launches into a lecture about how my \"problem\" was that Americans (she was the child of immigrants, but was born here!) misunderstand marriage and love. There was more, but I started to tune her out. \n\nAfter this tirade, she mentions how, at this point (age 30), she'd never had a boyfriend because she thought it was irresponsible to even date before your life was more or less set up. So the woman who never had a boyfriend was lecturing me about relationships. I then began to wonder how our chatting had gone so well, and sure enough, she admits that a friend had been \"helping her talk\" to me because she didn't understand dating. \n\nAt this, I simply looked at my wrist (I no longer wear a watch) and said \"Oh crap I forgot I had a thing,\" and walked out.

Then, when the estate was almost settled I got permission to shred some of the stuff, I went through it again before shredding.

{"body":"As he stood, he was surprised again and again every second this assassin did not shoot him. When he met eyes with her in the dark closet, she had a glint in her eye. For a moment neither of them moved or spoke. He desperately tried to make out her features in the darkness. He couldn't make out her expressions, if she was making any at all. Her weapon had a silencer. The gun hung in her hand limply, as if she had not decided whether or not she was going to use it, but the barrel still pointed.\n\n\"Do it.\" He whispered, though his eyes pleaded with her not to.\n\nShe stepped into the light coming from a lamp on the nightstand. Her features developed as she approached with light and shadow. Her eyes were on fire and her jaw was clenched. The stress in her face was somewhat covered by her hair, which was flat and straight laying against her shirt. The T-shirt was old and had the band name 'Pantera' written across the chest; the bass player tight on her stomach.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Her voice trembled.\n\nThe barrel of the gun traced under his chin and down his neck. She placed her hand on his chest and stopped the end of the gun at his heart. He was trained for this kind of thing. A person carrying a gun shouldn't get within arms reach of the person they are attacking. It wasn't clear if he could have gotten the best of her though. They didn't train the Knights for everything. There wasn't a protocol for assassins. He knew he shouldn't have hesitated to strike. But there was no protocol for thinking your assassin was beautiful.\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\" He said, short of breath.\n\n\"Am I doing something?\" She raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Killing me... I think...\" He managed to squeeze out a joke.\n\nShe was clearly not trying to laugh, because it came out like a hiccup. She covered her mouth with her free hand and blushed red around her cheeks. Her eyes rested and the whole room seemed to release itself of tension.\n\n\"I'm supposed to kill you.\" She said. \"I was paid.\"\n\n\"You don't look like a killer to me.\" His jaw hung open slightly.\n\n\"You don't look like one either... But you are.\" She responded. \"I've done work for the Underwood's before. And I've killed many young Knights like you.\"\n\n\"Then this should be easy.\" He raised his tone and moved towards her slightly.\n\n\"I can't.\" She whimpered.\n\n\"Why? Why can't you?\" He wondered.\n\n\"Tetris Attack!\" She yelled.\n\n\"What?\" He froze.\n\n\"I love Tetris Attack! I want to play. And I want to play the song with the dog.\" She went on. \"And that boss in Streets, I know how to beat that guy if we were playing two player. And, like, you like Star Trek TNG - and that's my favorite.\"\n\n\"Well, the movies are kinda shit.\" He continued.\n\n\"They're garbage!\" She said. \"It's so funny that you drink Earl Grey tea. I mean, it's stupid and adorable. And I had followed you to this house, that isn't owned by you by the way, and I saw you rocking out to Metallica.\"\n\n\"And you like Pantera.\" He smiled gently.\n\n\"How could you tell?\" She blinked, trying to hide a smile. \"And you're dark and funny. The e-mail you sent to Tom made me laugh. And... We've both killed people.\"\n\n\"Jesus.\" He exhaled. \"You're a fucking professional assassin.\"\n\n\"Call me Laina?\" She winced.\n\nIt was hard to tell whether or not his heart was beating fast from pure adrenaline or because he was in the presence of a woman that could make him fall in love with her as fast as she could kill him. Both of their eyes locked together worried about what was next. He realized that a couple of Knights could be incoming. And if this wasn't resolved, whatever this was, could turn into a shit storm.\n\n\"Laina, there are some Knights coming.\" He quickened. \"You have to leave.\"\n\nShe nodded nearly at the same time as someone knocked at the door. He grabbed her shoulders in sheer panic as she drew her gun up to his chin again.\n\n\"Oh god,\" She apologized. \"It's muscle memory. Sorry.\"\n\n\"Go play!\" He yelled and whispered at the same time.\n\nShe ran off to the living room. He walked towards the door and opened it. Sure enough, two Knights in uniform were at the door; helmets and all.\n\n\"Just checking to see if you're safe James.\" Said the Captain. \"We saw you got our message, but you never sent anything back. We also called you, and you didn't pick up. Have you seen or heard anything unusual tonight? We are concerned about the Underwoods trying to put a hit out on you. We're thinking of putting some security here or moving you to another safe house.\"\n\n\"I'd prefer moving to another safe house.\" He said.\n\n\"Alright, let's pack up.\" Said the Captain.\n\n\"Well, sir, my girlfriend is staying with me. Is it okay if she comes with?\" He sighed.\n\n\"Damnit James,” The Captain barked. “You aren't supposed to do shit like that. Just stay here. I'll get security.\"\n\nThe door shut behind them as they walked to their vehicle. The stairs creaked as he walked back to the living room. She sat there playing Tetris Attack, picking up where he left off. It had been so long since a girl sat on his couch and expected him to come back. Last time it happened he wasn't more than twenty years old. He framed a picture in his mind of this image of her nestled up to a video game on the couch.\n\nThey played and they flirted; beating up gang members, shooting head shots, and leveling up. They snacked on pizza rolls and drank a whole two liters of soda between the two of them. They high fived, fist bumped, and she punched his shoulder lovingly. They laughed together. Everything felt awfully natural despite the circumstances; even despite her gun resting with his on the nightstand. She took the initiative and straddled him for a kiss.\n\n\"No no no, it's not right.\" He stopped her.\n\n\"Oh come on. You know what? I changed my mind. I'm going to shoot you.\" She said with frustration on her face.\n\nHe laughed. \"I just want to see how much you actually like Pantera first. Here...\"\n\nHe gave her his air guitar, and she took it from his hands. She stroked the neck of the guitar and pulled the strap over her head. He turned the music up and she danced for him. He wanted to watch her performance but decided she was having too much fun. They strummed their air guitars around the house, bothering the Knights who were on security outside. They really used the space and jumped on furniture, jumped over chairs and sat on counters. Before long their own necks were a bit tired from head-banging and twirling their hair.\n\n\"Can I kiss you now?\" She said, out of breath.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever wanted anything more.\"","score":"1","subreddit":"WritingPrompts"}

I've wronged you if I've invaded your privacy, If I continue to touch you when you've expressly conveyed that you don't want me to do so, I am wronging you by invading your personal space.\n\nYou are entitled to these things, you have rights, in many countries protected constitutional (or other) laws. You don't have a \"right\" to have people \"acquiesce to your desire to be engaged with using specific unconventional language\".\n\n\u0026gt;it really does seem like you don't entirely get how much people tend to dislike having their gender identity invalidated\n\nIts not relevant to the conversation for me. I have autonomy and I choose how I interact with people, what language I use, the tone of voice I use etc. You want me to use the pronoun zeir and refer to you as a jam-filled lamington? Okay well make the request and I'll likely accommodate you, its no hair or coconut-flakes off my back. \n\nBut its not your right, I havent wronged you by not acquiescing to your wish, you arent entitled to choose how people refer to you or interact with you, and I won't be shamed for not cow-towing to some ridiculous totalitarian demand.\n\nI'll put aside my view of the world and you and call you whatever the fuck you like as long as you (not you specifically) arent being a cunt about it, because it costs me nothing, but its not how I see the world and I don't have to give anyone that benefit, and I won't if you behave poorly towards me - such as making shrill demands.\n\n\u0026gt;carries a load of implications about how you view (or don't view) them as a person, regardless of how you personally see it.\n\nThis might be true, but its not my problem. If someone else is going to assume that because I wont refer to them as a \"zir\" because I hate them or \"don't view them as a real person\", its not my problem. I don't have time for foolish people like that, they can fume as I move on with my life.\n\n\u0026gt;maybe things would be better if as a society we tried not to throw those low blows because someone made us angry\n\nApparently you still don't understand my position, which is astounding to me, but I'll try once more.\n\nI'm not talking about referring to someone as a gender or a pronoun they don't want to be referred to as, *as a low blow*. I'm not talking about any form of maliciousness. \n\nWhat I'm talking about is a scenario in which I see an individual who I perceive as a guy, they tick all the boxes for what identifies someone as a male in my personal list, therefore to me that person is a man. That individual which to me is every bit the male any other male could ever be, approaches me and demands that I call them by female pronouns and consider them a female, not in a polite request manner, but \"if you don't you're a disgusting bigot\" type of way.\n\nI'd be willing to sit there policing my language, to put in some amount of effort to conform to their wishes even though to me its a farce, but that effort is something I go out of my way to do for them, its a tiny little gift that I don't need to and are under no obligation to give.\n\nSo if that person behaves in a way which doesn't endear me to give them that gift, that tiny effort to police myself and conform to their reality rather than my own - even if only on a superficial level - then I won't.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm misgendering them or using the wrong pronouns with malice, or I'm \"throwing low blows\". I'm just being me interacting neutrally with the world as I see it. \n\n\u0026gt;Sometimes there are things that should, generally, be off-limits\n\nAnd this is kind of the shit I'm talking about. This is coming dangerously close to trying to make it mandatory to conform to peoples pronouns and gender identities. No, my perception of the world - and interacting honestly with others in line with that perception - shuold not be \"off limits\". \n\nSo again, hopefully for the last time, lets just reiterate some great advice for anyone who may want to have others interact with them using specific language, or as a certain gender.\n\nBe polite, people are generally nice, warm and well-meaning and you'll probably get people going out of there way to make you feel just that little bit better about yourself by going along with your wishes. But you arent entitled to it, you don't get to be mad when things don't go your way, and noone has to do anything just because you might be so insecure that it harms you.","score":"2","subreddit":"GGFreeForAll"}

It provides a natural contrast where you don't have to point out every little thing that is wrong with the LDS.  I would suggest that you try out various services on your 'off Sundays' until you find one you like and THEN introduce the girls to it.

{"body":"We were corralled out of the ship like cattle and dumped onto the gas powered life rafts which sped across the surface of the water with reckless abandon. They had our heads covered and our hands and feet bound but I could still tasty the salty spray of ocean water and my skin tightening under the harsh rays of the sun. One poor bastard who sounded like he was sitting behind me, was bounced from the raft when it took a wave too hard. Maybe he was lucky enough to die quickly down there but we certainly wouldn't.\n\nThey called it Edge Island, because we were supposed to be kept on the very fringes of society. But we all knew the truth. Edge Island was the most convenient way for the governments of the world to justify the billion dollar machines that supposedly picked out potential murders from society. Everyone was tested once every five years and a red light meant you were bagged, tagged and shipped off to the island. I'd made it to 25 before I was red lighted.\n\nThat's how we bonded the first night, swapping stories about being red lighted and what our lives were like before we were ripped from society. One of the guys, big burly mountain of a man with a wild beard and a wilder look in his eyes, suggested that we drop our names and pick something new. I chose Maverick and when the blonde haired beauty shot me a look I could only shrug. \"I love Top Gun.\" I said with no shame. Top Gun was awesome.\n\nOne by one we went around the circle, spouting off our new names until an innocent voice rocked the whole group. \"I always liked chess, so I'll be Bishop.\" the voice belonged to a little boy who had been standing behind the mountain man who had chosen Glass for his name. We all looked at one another but words failed us all. Bishop didn't seem to notice and continued \"Some people called me a prodigy, but I didn't get to play much.\" He slumped into a pout and the blonde rushed over and pulled him into a hug.\n\nThe night came and went quickly and the next day Glass took charge and we trekked into the sparse forest from the beach, hoping to find some wild animal we could split. That's when it began. The blonde, Snow as she wanted to be called, recommended we split up and to make less noise and not frighten anything away. I knew it was a bad idea, but the group voted against me and we split off into different directions. The guy I was paired with, Pills, wasn't much of a talker and I preferred the silence as we searched.\n\nThat changed when we heard the scream.\n\nOn an island full of murders, the last thing we should have been was surprised but we were. A sharpened branch had been driven through Snow's neck and pinned her to the flood. Her blood was pooling around her but little Bishop was there screaming at the top of his lungs, begging for his mommy. The machines were bullshit, no five year old should be stuck in this hell.\n\nGlass decided that we leave her body out as bait, said the smell of a fresh kill may attract some scavengers and we could pick them off. So we all backed away into the underbrush and watched Snow's body for one hour, two and then three before the sun began to set. Not even a bird came to pick at her body, and one by one everyone else scattered away into the trees to keep searching.\n\nGlass nudged me. \"If we have to, we can split her up.\" I could see the hunger in his eyes as he spoke. \"Wouldn't be too hard to get a fire going would it and cook up her hands, at least.\"\n\n\"You uh...you eaten people before?\"\n\nHe just shrugged. \"Only once. Guy was too fit, tough hard to chew. She looked a little softer though.\" He went and yanked the spike out of her throat with a sick slurping sound and began dragging her back to the beach. By then, the sun had set and everyone should have been back by now. But we only found two when we returned. \n\nPills and little Bishop were huddled around a fire, but there were two others missing. \"The hell happened?\" I could feel a primal fury welling in my gut as I pushed Pills. \"The hell did you do?\"\n\nPills cut me an icy glare. \"I ain't kill no one. But I ain't mad neither. Less mouths to feed.\"\n\nGlass stepped in before I could get another word in. \"Won't do any good to argue now. We need to eat.\"\n\nAnd so we did.\n\nThe next day, the fierce sun dragged me into consciousness and I tried not to think about the foul bubbling in my stomach that I'd fought against all night. Scanning the camp I saw that everyone was gone. I had a sneaking suspicions that Glass had everyone scouting for the other bodies, until I found his body with his enormous leather belt around his neck. The unpredictable wildness was gone from his eyes, now forever trapped in the moment of surprise before the breath was forced from him.\n\nThat's when i found them. Pills lying on the ground with Bishop standing over him. The kid had gouged out his eyes and was clutching a splintered length over his neck. With inhumane cruelty he stabbed down into Pills' neck. \"There goes the rook.\"\n\nHe turned to me and flashed a wild, manic smile at me. \"Time for a checkmate.\"\n\nI recoiled back and yanked off a tree branch as Bishop rushed toward me and  swung it wildly in his direction once he was upon me. A shrill crack pierced the air, intermingled with my own screams. And then there was silence.","score":"2","subreddit":"WritingPrompts"}

{"body":"I think you have an interesting style developing here. I'm going to try not to give you advice that steers you out of it and into painting like Rockwell or something. So basically I'm going to ignore drawing and recommend you work on your contrast and composition. Right now the overall image is pretty low contrast with the highest contrast mostly being the bright white on the distant trees next to the black of those distant trees. I doubt that's where you'd like the viewer to look so I would tone that down by either a)darken the highlights on those trees or b)lighten the darks on those trees. Lightening the darks will give a bit more atmospheric perspective but with this style you may want it to feel flatter so you may wish to darken the highlight instead to make the space feel flat or emphasize that it's cartoonishly dark.\nALMOST all of the trees are the same which is completely fine for a stylized look but the one tree/roots on the right are grabbing a ton of attention for me. I would avoid having those in there or make them more diagonal rather than horizontal. I might also try to put another horizontal line somewhere on the design of the characters. They're getting attention right now because they have unique colors and circles are only found there but a another horizontal in their design might also help them with standing out among all of the vertical lines of the trees. I would also suggest brightening the bottom corner and the characters. Compositionally you want to decide whether you want white figures on a dark background or dark figures on a light back ground. Right now it is a bit indecisive so it's dark value on dark value if you squint your eyes.","score":"1","subreddit":"ArtCrit"}

If you give these underpaid employees more money they are going to spend it and put it back into the economy. Prices don't need to be inflated because the poor are not going to hold onto the wealth. They are going to increase how much business the companies do which will help offset having to pay employees more.\n\nMost people cheat and steal because they cannot afford to pay. This adds risk in any business model. Risk is expensive to manage and costs the companies money. The more risk, the more expensive. If people don't have to cheat, steal, and take advantage, then they will tend not to. This will diminish risk in business models an save the companies money they can use to pay employees.\n\nThat's how I see it working, but how does this benefit me? I care about other people as a christian who understands we are all loved by God. That hundreds of millions of people are seeing improved quality of life is enough reason for me. However, there are selfish reasons as well.\n\nWhen the poor see more income, they are happier. That means I am going to deal with happier and friendlier people. That in turn makes me happier. When the poor have more money, they can afford a healthier lifestyle which reduces the cost of healthcare for everyone. When businesses have less risk, they don't need to put things into practice that negatively affect my experience with their product or service (e.g. DRM).","score":"9","subreddit":"SandersForPresident"}

Inflation and population growth would explain growth of about 4 per cent a year) (A decade ago the commonwealth’s social security bill was $86bn a year but it has grown to $154bn and will reach $270bn in 2025-26 on current trends, according to official data provided to The Weekend Australian. This year’s bill amounts to 36 per cent of federal payments of $428bn).\n\n**How that will be done**. The strategy, being called a “priority investment approach” within the government \n\n\u0026gt; Social Services Minister Christian Porter is aiming to identify the groups with the biggest risk of long-term welfare dependency, using the findings from consulting firm PwC to tackle a social blight that is being passed from one generation to another (months of work by PwC to analyse the past decade of welfare payments of every type across the country).\n\n\u0026gt; Central to the government agenda is the goal of breaking a cycle in which young children grow up in families relying heavily on welfare, without enough support to complete their education and join the workforce.\n\n\u0026gt; “The fact is that very soon policymakers in government will be able to **track** the success and failures of particular groups through the welfare system over the last decade with great accuracy,” Mr Porter told The Weekend Australian. “This will be a powerful basis on which to design future policy.\n\nmmm ... \"track\"? meaning privacy invasion?\n\n\u0026gt; “In short, we will soon be able to demonstrate with high accuracy who needs the most assistance and which programs genuinely produce the ultimate result of moving people off payments, out of the welfare system and into employment.”\n\n\"we will soon be able to demonstrate with high accuracy\", will they \"demonstrate\" it to *themselves*?, will that information be publicly available so people can see the data and possibly prove the Liberals that they are wrong? \n\n\u0026gt; The government will also be able to **zero in on payments that are failing to produce results**.\n\nThere you see, the politically correct way of saying it=\"**zero in on payments** that are failing to produce results\".\n\n\u0026gt; Social security outlays are rising quickly at a time when the tax burden is falling on a shrinking proportion of workers. About half of all households do not pay income tax in net terms after taking government benefits into account, according to estimates from the National Centre for ­Social and Economic Modelling. The analysis did not include GST payments.\n\n\u0026gt; The reform ambitions are backed by former Mission Australia chief Patrick McClure, who recommended an overhaul of the welfare system in a report to the government last year and is ­warning of the damage to society from long-term welfare dependency. “We know there are entrenched groups staying outside the labour force and many of them are staying on income support,” he told The Weekend Australian. “And this is passing from one generation to another, so we need to break that pattern. The earlier we can break the cycle, the greater the benefits.”  Mr McClure said investments in early childhood education, preschool training, a stable family life and help with schooling could all create the conditions for lifting youth out of welfare.  “The payback is that you’re reducing the welfare costs but you’ve also got a young person who’s got a job, is paying tax, is contributing more to society.”  He called for streamlining a system that has 20 payments and 55 supplements and said people who claimed the disability pension on mental health grounds should be encouraged into work.\n\n**What Labor is proposing**\n\n\u0026gt; A political stoush is certain, however, as Labor families spokeswoman Jenny Macklin prepares an alternative agenda early this year with a focus on “social investment” including school funding. The Labor document will argue for “real investment” in areas of deep disadvantage and inequality, warning that children can fall behind when very young and that the gap with the rest of society then widens over time.","score":"2","subreddit":"AustralianPolitics"}

{"body":"You're experiencing office politics for the first time.\n\nYou are playing the game using rationality, by trying to do what's best for the company, looking at things logically.\n\nThis is not how office politics work.\n\nOffice politics is learning that what matters more than results is the people around you's perspective / view of you.\n\nIf you are doing the best job in the world but nobody else sees it that way, it means you need to adjust.\n\nIf someone else sees you as an obstacle or as someone that makes them look bad, you need to find a way to make them feel like you're an ally and someone on their team.\n\nIf you know that doing things one way will work best, but the others around you want to do it another way, you need to not just push for what's best but consider supporting the other position and doing what you know won't work, because their opinion of you also matters and you want them to think you value the team over yourself.\n\nIf they are bringing in someone you think sucks but they've already made the decision, you express mild reservations but very gently and are enthusiastic afterwards.\n\nDoing the best job and people-pleasing are often at odds with each other. It's important to learn how to communicate in a way that maximizes both of those things, not just doing The Right Thing. You have to try to do The Right Thing but at the end of the day if you're concerned with your job and career the way they see you matters more than what you did. Steve Jobs got more credit and was more famous than Steve Wozniak. Steve Jobs stayed head of Apple while Woz got sidelined. Steve Jobs was a political mastermind. Steve Wozniak is a technical mastermind.\n\nIt seems you haven't managed other's perspective of you as well as you could, this is also quite possibly not your fault at all but rather a series of unfortunate events.\n\nIf you want to know what I think the best way you can realpolitik (politics based on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral or ethical premises) your way out of this bad situation, I would do the following:\n\n1. Apologize to the two others who don't like you as much and CC the higher management people.\n2. Tell them you know you're still young and learning how to work in a team and that you've begun to realize you've gotten off to a bad start in some aspects.\n3. Talk about how you want to turn over a new leaf and work as more of a team player. That in the past you always tried to do what you thought was best, but now you've come to realize that regardless of how strongly you feel about any particular situation, it's about working together as a team first and foremost.\n4. Ask the others to point out any time you make errors in communication / things you could do to improve your teamwork.\n5. Thank them for their patience and understanding in your learning and state your enthusiasm for growing more now that you are more aware of these sorts of things.\n\nIf you are objecting to this after reading it or thinking this is all bullshit, then you aren't focused on your career results, you're more worried about \"The Truth\", \"Reality\", or your ego. But if you just want to maximize your career and avoid getting fired or demoted, then this is the best way to do it in my opinion. It takes courage to admit your mistake (or a devious political mind to admit a mistake publicly while thinking the other two are fuckups in private).\n\nGood luck.","score":"60","subreddit":"relationships"}

My son was born in August 2013, I got an order in my state (the state our son was conceived in and his mother lived until 8 months pregnant) for paternity testing.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a state to enforce an order from another state?  It took a year before she finally did the testing, by that point I could not legally start any proceedings in my state because he had lived in another state for 6 months.  I had to save up to pay $3500 to pay an attorney in HER state (2000 miles away) to file a case there.  It took four months to get that state to decline jurisdiction so my state can hear his custody case along with his older brother (which has also been delayed years due to her leaving).

Because I am so much older, I am able to provide her with a sense of stability as she moves forward. Plus, I can give her comfort and support having been through many of the same experiences relatively recently. It's actually really rewarding being able to watch her learn and grow as a person - I've always loved mentoring and teaching, so having that aspect to a relationship is really nice for me.  But that said, she does bring a strong level of social awareness. I am more of an introvert than she is, she it's really nice having someone who enjoys meeting new people, and planning get togethers and all that stuff. And so she'll sort of take care of our social calendar while I will make sure that we are making time for us, and take point on planning day trips or nice little dates for us to go on. And that's not to say that I don't like people, if we go out with a group, I'll mostly just talk to them and sort of keep them engaged... and she'll disappear for 15 minutes and come back with 8 new friends for us to meet. So I really think we complement each other well. It's a nice little give and take that enriches both of us.

Maxis, using electronics, contacts the other three telling them to power the towers in his favor so he can tear open agartha and defeat Richtofen while reuniting with his daughter samantha.\n\nOver the course of the black ops 2 maps the players can either power the towers in favor of Richtofen or Maxis. Eventually this leads them to the final tower in the map, Buried. If the players have followed Richtofen's commands then Richtofen possesses Samuel's body and basically becomes ruler of the world, and damming the soul of Maxis and Samantha. If the players follow Maxis, Maxis reaches agartha to reunite with Samantha and sends Richtofen's soul into a zombie. Unfortunately if Maxis reaches Agartha the earth and it's inhabitants will die.\n\nUnknown to both Germans that Samantha had traveled back in time to a alternate dimension to World War I 1918 where a zombie outbreak begins in Northern France. (The map Origins) Here is where the O4, Dempsey, Takeo, Nikolai, and Richtofen meet for the first time. They are contacted by Samantha and are asked to help free her from Agartha. The 4 decide to cooperate with each other and work together to survive the horrors of the zombie outbreak. After the easter egg is completed the group finally free Samantha From Agartha.\n\nBlack ops 3:\n\nAbout two years have passed and the new O4 have traveled in time to the Der Riese facility for unkown reasons. Dempsey, Takeo and Nikolai confront the future Richtofen just as he has locked Maxis and Samantha in the teleporter with the hellhound. Just then after Maxis and Samantha are teleported away Zombies begin to attack. The Future richtofen opens up the teleporter to find the younger richtofen inside, after being missing for two years. The young richtofen approaches his future self and quickly shoots him in the head. The others scold him for attempting to change the future, but Richtofen stands by his decision. The 4 stand up once more to face the zombies horde. \n\nNot the best summary or the most 100% accurate, but it will do. I suggest looking up some youtube videos or something to help as well.\n\nAlso in case it wasn't clear or obvious the 4 characters from The Giant are not the same as the ones from Black ops 1.","score":"1","subreddit":"CODZombies"}

{"body":"Well I am still not a web developer by trade. It's only been about 7 months since I got started and I had literally 0 experience with any kind of coding before starting. Granted, I have a 2 year old daughter, 2 month old son and a full time job in a completely unrelated field. I know if I had 8 hours or more per day to dedicate to learning and building, I would be a lot further, but it is what it is and I still enjoy it very much. Pretty confident I could easily handle a junior front end position if I needed to. \n\nSo... what have I built? I haven't built anything for money. So far I have only built ideas I've had just to see if I could do it and I've built several projects for learning sites. At the moment I am currently working on a completely offline app that won't include any kind of backend. It will just be an desktop html shortcut that'll open in Chrome (js and css files in a hidden folder so they can't be messed with...) and it will cut waaaaaaayyy down on my paperwork at my current job by eliminating the redundancy of it. I have a meeting Friday to introduce it to the production manager and possibly have it pushed into production for everyone to use. The coworkers I've shared it with are very pleased to have a lot of their paperwork reduced as well. \n\nI've mostly worked with just HTML, CSS and Javascript, but I've also build things with AngularJS, Ruby on Rails and even a couple of simple phone apps with Java.

But you will *probably* not be robbed at gunpoint there. Anyway, don't leave your cellphone, wallet or any other valuable item visible or unattended. Also, don't ask for information to people on street. Ask for a police officer, at hotels (better chance that someone there will speak english) or at big stores. If **you have to**, ask for information for people on street, do that on the most crowded place possible. And discretely ask the same information for two different people and see if they tell you the same thing.

If you have the option, always go to bigger stores.\n\nThe taxi drivers cannot give you a price beforehand (in some places there are cabins where you can buy a ride for specific places and then they can have preestablished prices, but the taxi driver cannot do that by himself).

Mercy comes to us through the grace of Christ which is also offered to all men equally as the gospel is preached to the spirits of the dead, and the necessary ordinances can be performed for the entirety of the human race in a fraction of the time of the millennium so that mercy is extended to all.  God being Omnipotent and Omniscient has set each of us in a position where we are able to to learn for ourselves to choose between Good and Evil and to do good or evil, to be tried and tested according to what we need to grow and discover if what we are to become for ourselves by our choices, as we are co-eternal with God the choices we make are our own whatever the nature of God's Omniscience which is not something that we do know for sure, or that really matters one way or the other. \n\nAs per Romans 11 to claim that only Christians are saved by God is to deny the mercies of Christ and to call God a liar, as all of Israel is of the covenant and we do not know all that God has in store for all people on the earth, again as per Alma, God doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have, so to pretend that someone would be damned for following that which God has granted them is to damn oneself, as one can only follow that which God has granted oneself with a certainty that one does not have all knowledge that God has. As in Jacob 5 the vineyard of the Lord has many trees and many branches which produce all manner of fruit, and those who are called to labor in the vineyard are not the only ones who are saved, but are called with a purpose of saving all the trees in the vineyard and lead all the branches and trees to eventually produce good fruit. \n\nDon't quench the Spirit or place limits on where it can go, it goes where it pleases. \n\n","score":"2","subreddit":"latterdaysaints"}

I don't do much in combat, but my Construct does, and everyone likes basically-free equipment! However, I'm likely going to multiclass into some kind of caster, as the Master Craftsman feat is a goddamn disgusting tax, and I hate that Paizo doesn't just bite the bullet and say \"Alchemists class level counts as their Caster Level for item creation feats\", as alchemists not being able to be functional item-creators without weird stuff is fucking stupid imo.","score":"2","subreddit":"Pathfinder_RPG"}

{"body":"[Economic policy institute](http://stateofworkingamerica.org/fact-sheets/wages/#sthash.2nsnfImQ.dpuf) says that wages have only gone up .5%. When including benefits, they'd only gone up 4% since 2000. suppose you're making 15/hr, even on a 4% increase, you're only making 15.60/hr. That's not much growth. They continue that \"Americans earning the lowest wages (those at the 10th percentile) actually earned less in 2011 than the lowest earners in 1979.\"\n\nYour article is comparing the situation now to 1975 in most aspects. We can't assume that the standard of living of 1975 is near the same as the standard now, considering productivity is substantially higher unless we talk about that productivity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that when established, the federal minimum wage was half the wage earned by non-supervisory workers in the late 1960s. The minimum wage in 2011 was 37 percent of the wage earned by non-supervisory workers. \n\nI'm not ignoring your source, there's a lot to read over, but even with his methodology spread out, with households decreasing in the number of dependents, the only way that household income could have changed while wages rose (and dependents dropped) is because there are more single adults. \n\nAnd, again, not to discredit your source, but they probably should have excluded the top 1% (and maybe even bottom 1% for fairness). [CnnMoney](http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/16/news/economy/middle_class/index.htm) does this. It's worse when you think about it this way because that means while there's more than enough money for everyone's wages to have increased, the top 1% have taken so much of it that the middle class doesn't see there wages change at all.

{"body":"Some of your numbers are incorrect:\n\nEnergy Drain has a base duration of 5 seconds with a grenade recharge multiplier of **x1.6**\n\nThe Hunger increases the duration of energy drain by another 6 seconds for a total duration of 11 seconds.  The improved energy drain aspect of Skull of Dire Ahamkara also does this as it provides The Hunger as a bonus skill.  \n\n**The Hunger had its duration bonus doubled in Y2 from its original bonus of 3 seconds to 6 as part of some undocumented 2.0 patch changes to class abilities.**\n\nSo with a full energy drain synergy build each instance of this buff will last for 11 seconds and over the course of that duration it will take 6.6 seconds off your grenade cooldown under normal circumstances.  Since energy drain is a multiplier its reduction in seconds will become far more powerful when combined with modifiers like Song of Flame, Catapult, Mayhem, or the extra grenade charge with Nothing Manacles (bonus grenades have x2 cooldown).\n\nAlso the other part of Delusions of Grandeur increases your damage reduction in the Nova Bomb animation by 20% (45% base to 65%) enabling a full armor build at full health to survive any super other than a direct hit from Fist of Havoc or Nova Bomb.","score":"1","subreddit":"DestinyTheGame"}

{"body":"The pilot and Season 1 was pretty bad overall.  It really has a hard time grabbing people.\n\nI'd say dialogue throughout the series is definitely a weakness that is saved by the amazing plotting and some characters.  Most attempts at comedy were misses in my opinion.  JMS is just an odd person and doesn't pull off \"everyday\" people very well in B5 or his show Jeremiah.  He really could have used a co-writer that was strong where he was weak. \n\nLondo and G'Kar were amazingly written and acted.  But others such as Sheridan were just actors saying lines at times.  Sheridan, and sometimes even Delenn, never felt \"real\" to me.\n\nB5 was the first show that I was an uber fan of, I daily posted to the moderated newsgroup as soon as it was up.  I think Farscape has surpassed it for me though because they got the dialogue, humor and off beat stuff so right.  The characters feel more \"real\" to me, even if the overall plots aren't quite as epic.\n\nThe sets and CGI haven't aged well at all.  The music probably hasn't either but I love it too muchto know.\n\nJMS was eager to reboot he series and almost got his chance.

{"body":"As a Brit living in Canada, I was initially impressed by the selections here compared to the UK. But the US blows Canada away when it comes to shopping choice.\n\nFoodwise, we do pretty well - although many products are grossly over-priced. Cheese for instance is terrible - there's basically a cartel that sets prices. Canada only has a limited number of native cheeses and most of the fancy cheese is foreign (either actually imported or made here in the style of a foreign cheese). As a Brit who loved the range of cheese I had access to in the UK, it's a big disappointment.\n\nWine is another thing you need to be prepared to give up (well... cut back on anyway) if you come to Canada. In BC the tax on imported wine is over 100%. So a bottle that costs $US5 will cost around $14 in Canada (accounting for import duty \u0026amp; currency differences). Plus restaurants have to buy their alcohol at retail price from a retail liquor store - so expect to pay $30-40 for that $5 wine if you order it in a restaurant. That's only BC though... I suspect the other provinces aren't as backwards.\n\nFor non-grocery items our pricing isn't always as bad, but the range is typically very poor compared to the US. When the currencies were closer, I used to shop in the US a lot. You'd typically find 3-4 times as many choices in a US clothing/electronics/household store as in a Canadian one.\n\nTarget was a very interesting example when they expanded into Canada a couple of years ago. They're definitely a go-to store in the US... great prices, massive selection, decent quality. But the Canadian stores never hit the mark: poor selection (half of which was typically out-of-stock at any given time) and prices which weren't that special. After about two years they closed down and retreated back to the US.","score":"8","subreddit":"AskAnAmerican"}

Its almost as if the mid and low bass is entirely tapered off and absent. There isnt a fullness of sound that is present in my other headphones like the X2. for their price at discounts of 60, they would be good headphones but since you have the X2s, i cannot imagine the need for SHP9500. trying both on now, music and movies become moving. Try the SHP9500 for 60 if it will satisfy your curiosity, zeo's reviews always does that to me, and for some reason i trust his ears. but in my opinion i dont think it would be worth it at 100 especially if you have the X2 already.\n\nedit: oh yea, the SHP drivers will touch your ears unless mod-ed.","score":"1","subreddit":"headphones"}

He was sort of an Asian skinhead looking guy with combat boots, neck tattoos and chain piercings galore (not judging, just trying to paint a picture).  \n\nHe was staring at us through the dark reflection of this window with a wild smirk on his face for a good 10 minutes. We ignored him and kept the conversation natural, naturally. Suddenly he started whispering to himself, giggling. It became louder and louder turning into some sort of warlock cackle and strange death threats.\nI text my friends and we plan to switch cars in two stops from then and when the time comes we walk a good 4 cars back and jump on as the doors close without looking back.\nAhh, quiet at last. We take seats and start chatting again but something just doesn't feel right. I look up and see this shadowy, dead pan face staring through the connecting car's window...  \n\nOk, at this point we consider he could be some crazy knife-wielding lunatic stalking us or just some guy trying to make us uncomfortable to get his rocks off. We have no idea, but there'd been train stabbing in recent months and we're really starting to get creeped out. \n\nAnother 10 minutes go by and the dude disappears. Our stop finally arrives and we exit the platform down an open set of stairs. 20 meters away there is another set of stairs. I glance over, there's the dude.

Iran does not exactly have the best relations with much of the Middle East. \n\n\u0026gt; Well these \"lingering hostlities\" have not prevented a recent deal and US-Iran cooperation in a vareity of other matters including the war in Afghanistan and Iraq\n\nMostly because Iran already has a vested interest in this, regardless of what other countries want to do. It just so happened that Iran's interest was the same as the US. It's like how the US was willing to work with the USSR for things like SALT even though relations during this time were cool *at best*. \n\n\u0026gt; furthermore you don't make firends with people who are already friends, the whole point is to END the hostiiliies\n\nWhich is far, far easier said than done. Just look at Cuba, and how long it took, and Cuba is nowhere near as much of a diplomatic issue as Iran, since after the Cuban missile crisis, there were not really any other major incidents, while Iran continuously causes incidents. Not only this, but again there is not reason to become allies to do this. You can open up trade relations and diplomatic relations without ditching Israel and Saudi Arabia in favour of Iran.

{"body":"I can certainly address what you view as holes in the article and explain why the choices were made.\n\n1. Oath is played as a control deck. The proof is in deck construction where most versions will play an array of controlling elements with some players going as far as playing Standstill while nobody plays extra tutors to turbo out Oath and Orchard. The only combo Oath deck is Burning Oath with draw-7s and a Tendrils kill.\n2. This may just be semantics but for clarity I labelled it \"Dark Petition decks\" because storm is a vague title. I feel that the addition of Dark Petition makes the decks play out significantly differently than old TPS lists so I just labelled them uniquely.\n3. I mentioned prison Shops and as e-chem-nerd pointed out Stax=/=Smokestack.\n4. Merfolk is a hatebears deck that is on the aggressive range of the spectrum as opposed to having more lock pieces. By my definition of a hatebears deck it fits though you can certainly disagree with me.\n5. Dark Confidant may not be common but he is certainly playable, especially in hatebears. Listing Dark Confidant as a replacement for Necropotence and Yawgmoth's Bargain shows to me that you don't understand what the purpose of good old Bob is in Vintage.\n6. I don't think you've played Dack Fayden in Gush decks before then. His + ability is amazing card selection and he is run in matchups where there is no fear of big artifacts from the opponent.\n7. Chrome Mox is a staple in Belcher (and sometimes Thoughtcast decks) and Deathrite Shaman is a staple in Hatebears decks that can cast it.\n8. Doomsday is still a tutor, Belcher and some Dark Depths decks play Expedition Map, yes Enlightened Tutor is rare, and I didn't mention any restricted cards in the pictured list because I specifically mention them as staples as well. Adding the whole restricted list rather than saying \"aside from the restricted list\" and \"in addition to the restricted list\" would make the whole section bloated.\n9. As much as I oppose it yes, people do play Tarmogoyf.\n10. That is why it is listed under an archetype rather than being it's own.\n\nIf you have any other concerns that you would like me to address feel free to post them.

We really don't know what the game is talking to when it's measuring ping. It could be talking to a completely different piece of hardware. The IP that all the game messaging is coming from could be a load-balancer or some other piece of hardware that exists in a DMZ(a network segment between you and the actual server doing the processing). If this is the case when you ping it you're cutting out the time to hit the actual server and it's also likely that the in-game ping method does some actual processing on the ping message and then sends a response...this also adds time.

While unraveling many secrets during the past decades, I have not only accomplised the unimaginable but also achieved great victories. \n\nWhen the tides of war engulfed the southern kingdoms, creating abominations of fear and despair, the Great Council of Xalundrar contacted me in order to solve the mystery of Ghan'dra N'hel. A heap of stones, nothing more but a rotting ruin, amidst the dark forests of Faldranor, yet feared by the brave, I was sent to explore what many called a cunning manifestation of evil spirits. So I traveled to the remains of Gahn'dra N'hel, once homestead of the most wise and elaborate of wizards. The dark forest - filled with gruesome creatures from a different plane, watching over the old trees of Faldranor - was not only an ordeal for my new robe, but also for my new friend, Oscwar, the hog. \n\nAs we cut through the coppice, admiring the strange colored flowers and insects alike, we did not encounter any menace worth telling, arriving at the forsaken palace in good health, thirsty for unavowed ken and of course some ale. Preparing for the night, we disguised ourselves as vines, sleeping well and undisturbed while the savage howls of direful wights accompanied our lovely dreams.\n\nIt was the sun's early rays to wake me and witness the blissful rising of the wraiths of Ghan'dra N'hel which have been wrongly accused of haunting the place - but instead were rebuilding it, turning magical essence into matter. While watching their enthusiastic pottering about without further ado, I was able to learn about new ways how to manipulate beings and objects inside our world. In fact, I did learn much more.\n\nWith my cunning sagacity and certainly the high quality of my pen and paper, I was able to archive this knowledge for future studies - which I did continue in secret after my return to my lofty chambers at Lofghanllaldordlogllanfaldar, a most peculiar place, yet quiet and undisturbed for my activities.\n\nI feel quite certain, respected SirActionSlacks, that you might be in need of my then discovered insights, that you might even profit from my experiments of turning magical essence into matter and vice versa, that you might value this gift of mine despite the pain it will bring upon certain individuals.

But it also provides avenues for new styles, new voices and new perspectives to succeed that certainly did not exist 10 years ago. Some folks, like Aaron, will become amazing journalists as they go along. Others may not and it won't work out for them. And some may just continue on as columnists/thinkpiece writers, and there are plenty of great, valuable voices doing that work. \n\nThe reality is you can find good and bad examples in every facet of media, legacy or new.

They need to look at Diablo 3 and add some of those features. Danger Room is just Rifts, which is perfect. But they should open them up to all levels. I want to be able to do Danger Room as a leveling option. \n\nAn Endless dungeon with scaling loot, as they have teased, needs to happen. I dont understand why it hasnt yet. It needs to exist. We dont need another patrol zone. If anything they should just add skins to MM and Industry City. Dont dilute the player base. \n\nCosmic Midtown was a great addition, more gated challenges is what the game needs. Less raids.... no more raids. They're not worth the dev time since so few people enjoy them. Replace it with diablo style difficulty scaling. More people in a group, better gear and harder enemies for terminals and other challenge modes. \n\nX-defense. There is money to be made there. Increase the rewards, greatly increase the XP for omega farming. Have less enemies, and more difficult enemies. Like each wave should have a group of heavily affixed mobs with few other minions. So the challenge is in play style, not spamming. \n\nOver all, bosses outside of the highest end content need to have less health. It isnt fun spamming 2 abilities on one enemy who cant possibly kill me but takes 5 minutes to kill. Make them do more damage.

For example anyone who is processing payments or other kinds of blockchain transactions doesn't have to rely on a thrid party if they run their own node. And of course running a full node makes perfect rational sense for anyone who is financially invested in the health of the Bitcoin network in any way. This isn't a tragedy of the commons scenario, instead it's a scenario where the people with the biggest investment have the biggest incentive to contribute.\n\n\u0026gt; The core team are trying to solve the tragedy of the commons issue by making the blocks small enough so that running a node is cheap. If running a node stays cheap, then the system can stay decentralized with volunteers. \n\nHere's an alternative interpretation: assuming a bigger blocksize is ultimately necessary for Bitcoin's utility to keep increasing, then not raising the blocksize would limit the incentives to contribute to the network to the status quo. By raising the blocksize and allowing more use cases to develop and prosper, more people will be incentiviced to participate and invest in this ecosystem, and will thus have a reason to contribute and keep it healthy, i.e. by running a node.\n\n\u0026gt; run tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands more nodes\n\nHow much \"better\" would a network with hundreds of thousands of nodes really be compared to a network with let's say 5000 nodes?

{"body":"Mormon here, and I'd like to explain a bit. You may not agree but I hope you'll understand.\n\nFirst some background, so we believe that families are divine and that heaven is a continuation of the family life here but in a ever progressing and faultless form. The core of that family is a woman and man who are married to each other. People cannot be baptized if they are having sex outside of that relationship. This includes cohabitation and same sex relationships. This looks like it is discriminating against gays and admittedly we have a ways to go in acceptance and love as I think everyone does, but really that rules applies across the board. A lot of people are \"banned\" because they live together and need to get married before joining. Banned is not really the right word. We don't want you to get baptized in the church unless you believe the church's teachings and want to, and so there are requirements.\n\nThe recent adjustment to the rules that has been in the news so often is usually misunderstood. That is that same sex couples and their children are not allowed [Edit: to become members of the church. As was pointed out below they are still welcome at meetings]. The point is not at all to ban gays. The point is to avoid contention and breaking apart families. There are similar restrictions to Muslims in certain circumstances. That is not to ban Muslims or that we have anything against Islam, but the fact that converting to Christianity could make you a pariah and endanger you, and if that is the case your life and well being are worth more. If you are the child of a same sex couple and want to get baptized we do not want to cause estrangement from your parents and other related conflict. Your well being and family are more important. The church is designed to help families and if trying to keep you in the church is going to damage that then we will keep you from coming. God will make it right in the end.\n\nWe will still teach that we think that the family is divine and try to help families whatever that circumstance. Like I said at the beginning you may not think banning them to avoid estrangement and contention is the best way. Perhaps there are better ways, but we'll keep moving forward and try to learn to love and empathize whatever the circumstance.","score":"-8","subreddit":"Christianity"}

{"body":"No.  You'll waste 2-3 months of your life to be useless when the shit hits the fan.  Even good EMT schools only give you the basic tools, it takes months to not feel like an idiot on the job.  You will have zero supplies and without them you're limited to cpr and positioning a patient.  Odds are your first patient will be badly injured and you will freeze or not see the big picture.  I wasn't that useful at my first accident and I had a partner.  \n\nTake a CPR course, anything else is a bad use of your time.  Look I get it, you're hurting right now and you want to feel like you're doing something.  It's great that you want to help people.  But an EMT with no real world experience or equipment is damn near useless.  You want to do this for a job then ok, heads up its low pay, dangerous and not super rewarding.

{"body":"I'm not saying happy, I'm saying not reacting drastically. And I kind of doubt there were large amounts of older people and children out during NYE stuff at night, but either way.. If they were not already leaving the area of these events, then the cops cannot determine if they are for or against the events. That's what I mean by reacting drastically. If someone pulls a gun in a crowd and the crowd doesn't start moving away, the police have no way of determining the difference between who is with the gunman and who is not. It's the same way with this stuff. It's very difficult in large crowds to determine who is going to side with the offenders without clear visual or audial indicators. The difference is that during the day, you can\n\n1. See properly. Important for knowing when someone stops being a bystander and when they become a threat. Important for seeing the faces of the people you are confronting. You can gauge their emotions, and determine if they're trying to run away scared or violently preparing to fight back.\n\n2. They are less likely to be drunk and partying, because it will not be NYE at night. Drunken crowds are a danger more than sober crowds, because of the limitations to rationality that being intoxicated tend to come with.\n\nAs for the 100 something reports filed, I still have been seeing reports that the attackers were at most around 60. Not 100. 100 incidents, as described with the large group loitering in front of the train station, can happen with a much smaller group. Not everyone was attacked at once, not everyone was in a group. If it goes on for a few hours, then every 10-20 minutes one might expect people to try and enter the station, if unaware of what is going on.\n\nBut again, this happened at night. There was a large group of people, many of which were drunk, some of which were not running away or seemingly in fear of the fireworks or bottles, and apparently you also had many innocent bystanders trying to leave too.\n\nIf you set off a panic in a relatively constricted area (a square full of people with cops at the exit streets), it will be dangerous. It only takes a few people stepping on someone that falls down and they will likely be injured, if not severely. Several hundred will almost certainly lead to deaths.\n\nBreaking up violence at a planned protest is a lot different than breaking up violence during festivities in the middle of the city. With a planned protest, you can assume most people are there to protest and use certain amounts of force without media frenzy over injuring innocents. With a sudden event, you don't know who is the problem and who just can't get away or doesn't understand they're in a bad place. You have unknowns, tons of them.\n\nThey do use crowd control on riots though, because then they know the crowd is almost certainly all a problem. Day or night, they'll use tactics. But this wasn't a riot, it wasn't a planned protest.\n\nThe potential for unknown actors, events, and injuries likely kept the police from acting with these tactics during this event. It's not a good solution, but it still might be better than having hundreds of people trampled, or arsonists starting, or cars being flipped, or store windows being smashed, or random people attacked in the crowd for who knows what logic in reaction to fear of what the police do.\n\nAnd, seeing the way Reddit reacts, I'm pretty sure we'd have just as big of a shit storm if the police had started using water cannons or pepper spray or bean bag bullets on the crowd. \n\nRemembering that not everyone there is guilty, or wanted to be involved, or knew they were involved, is important. But remembering that the police knew very little concrete information, is also important. They likely had little more to go on than \"Group of people by train station molesting, harassing, attacking\" so on, and perhaps some basic descriptions. That tells them almost nothing about if the group is coordinated, if they have other accomplices in the crowd, what their motivations are (are they stealing, raping, killing? Do they want to kill cops, and are provoking a response? Is this a trap? How many people here agree with their motives and are just watching?)\n\nSo yeah, unknowns, bad situation, PR nightmare, potential innocent bystanders, you can write up a pretty long list of why they might have done whatever actions the police did. And they likely chose whatever they thought would work the best out of them, even if it really sucked.\n\nI mean, I don't if Germany has protest spaces but.. The US does. Planned protests take place in clearly marked boxes. The fact that this was a planned protest makes me think in some way it was similar. The police knew what they were getting into with this, but not with the other. That changes the best way to react.","score":"0","subreddit":"worldnews"}

This will no doubt slow down slayer exp, but save tons of hours spent in Abyss making up for the exp that could have been gained with slayer.\n\nIn a gist: Maximize the slowest Abyss combat skill exp/h in slayer.\n\nIn the end, your guide is slayer exp efficient, but not overall exp efficient.","score":"3","subreddit":"runescape"}

A friend of mine has an e-collar that has a tracker on it as well as a boundary range, so her dog cannot leave 100 yards or whatever she programs. I highly recommend this, especially the tracker part. \n\nOtherwise just be very very careful, hounds are known to wonder off and follow their nose. \n\nOne day my TWC mix managed to slip out of his harness while we were on a hike, he ran ahead but seemed to be constantly checking in with me, trying to get me to play chase with him. He wouldn't let me close enough to get him back on leash and was prancing around so proud to be off leash, but I was not worried as we were on hiking trails in the middle of the woods. I finally got him to come take a treat from me and just as I was putting on the leash someone on a bike rode by and scared him and he took off and managed to find the only road in the area and was nearly hit by a car. Thankfully he was fine and some woman who was driving by helped me wrangle him in using her dog but after that I have been incredibly careful. Seeing him almost hit was a huge wake up call that made me realize that you never know what's going to make your dog run off, and if something scares them or they start chasing an animal your treats are not going to work.\n\nI really don't mean to scare you or be a downer, just wanted to share my experience so you can be very careful. I am doing some off leash training with mine now in a wooded area that is fenced off from any roads (state preserve) and having some success there.

Bandcamp offers pay-what-you-want options for the music on their site, many bands use this as an alternative to a gofundme campaign. This way, people who want to donate are still doing so, and they're also getting something out of it. Fans also can buy merch directly from the artist themselves (at least if they have their own store set up separately from whatever label their attached to).

{"body":"GREETINGS EVERYONE!!!!!!!\n\nWe have decided to try having a biweekly **Buy/Trade/Sell** thread. So if you have items that you are interested in getting rid of (bought the wrong size on final sale? wore something once and decided it wasn't for you? owned something for years but never wear it?), you can try posting them in that thread. Of course, we are going to have some ground rules:\n\n- Only active members of FFA can post items. We will not allow new users or users that do not participate in this sub to post. Lurkers or people that participate in other subreddits will have to use /r/wardrobepurge to get rid of items.\n\n- You participate in that thread AT YOUR OWN RISK. The moderators of FFA cannot really do anything if you get screwed, so do your due diligence. It is always a risk to buy or sell items to strangers on the internet rather than through legitimate companies. The moderators of FFA cannot help you reclaim lost items or collect unpaid money. \n\n- You must post actual item photos (you can also post additional product photos, but you have to actually show the specific item that you own as well). We will only allow imgur links. You may not link to ebay, craigslist, etsy, or any other online shops. Users can PM each other to work out the details of the transaction.\n\n- Once an item has been sold or traded, please edit your post to indicate such. \n\nThe reason we have all these rules is because we do not want to invite users to spam our subreddit with their crap. Some regular users have expressed interest in purchasing the items of FFA members because the closeness of the community and the overall level of taste here give the buyer a bit more confidence in the transaction. You cannot rely on the closeness of the community to guarantee a quality product or a secure transaction, but we are open to experimenting with this a bit.\n\nThreads will be posted on Saturdays, every other week. We will probably start next week (so, not tomorrow). Thank you to /u/Evenstar22 for approaching us with the suggestion.","score":"32","subreddit":"femalefashionadvice"}

{"body":"I still like New Day. The beat down they did a few months ago was cool, but it's meant to be a comedy act. Having them be the Wyatt's wouldn't help. I honestly preferred Kidd and Cesaro over them, but at the moment I'm not sure who would be a better tag team. You mention Lucha Dragons, but Sin Cara is injured. Who gets the belts then? Either Uso's or Enzo and Cass? I don't think any other face tag team has the POWA! Maybe, Dudleys if they could win a number 1 contender match. \n\nI don't think that's fair. Brock looks intimidating and has a UFC background to back it up along with a great NCAA record. Roman... was part of The Shield... with probably the most basic move-set out of that group. \n\nI agree, Brock needs to lose. I do however think that giving that rub to Roman only puts Roman more in the goofy superman role and is anti-climactic. They should put it on someone who could use the rub. Since Roman is already rubbed pretty well by having never lost a singles match(Cleanly).\n\nSin Cara and Kalisto both need to improve. Sin Cara should also get a new mask. \n\nBryan's call. I wouldn't tell you when to hang up your love/passion. I'm not going to act like I know Bryans situation better then he does. \n\nI don't mind Y2J's on again off again presence, but he was never my favorite. \n\nBray is fine and a dark horse to win the Rumble this year. People forget that Bray is one of like 3 people to have ever pinned Roman. The only talent under 30(Still under 30... Randy might have, but Randy is no longer under 30) to ever fight Undertaker at WM. Bray is fine and just biding his time until Taker retires to truly become the face of fear. What do you think Bray needs that he is missing? He has a stable, solid ring work, Solid look/gimmick and mic skills. \n\nI'm excited for the rumble, but also staying grounded. I thought the Rumble Cena won a few years ago was going to be pretty awesome, but then it was just fed to The Rock vs Cena feud. I'll be fine as long as Roman doesn't win or just go on to beat Brock at WM32 for the belt Brock wins by winning the Rumble. \n\nNJPW will be fine. They are constantly building stars for situations like this. \n\nNever read it. \n\nKevin Owens seems pretty popular. \n\nWWE has kept me hooked since Macho Man died/CM Punk's pipe bomb, but if Roman walks out of WM or Royal Rumble with the belt...

In fact, reliving the trauma repeatedly in psychotherapy may serve to re-enforce the preoccupation and fixation.\" IOW you'll have to find another way to resolve the issues surrounding the trauma but you'll still be stuck with the fetish but maybe with some ability to regulate it. \n\nI'm of the camp that would use genetics as an explanation only as a very last resort. It's just too easy to replace \"the devil made me do it\" with \"the genes made me do it.\" I've even seen crossdressers claim that their wearing of a skirt is genetic. LOL! It's not even genetic for females. Certainly genes promote vague and general traits. I have about 100 animals (cattle, horses, chickens, pigs, cats, dogs-no goats) on my little farm and it fascinates me how each animal has it's own \"personality\" and how traits and tendencies are passed down through generations.

But when you say \"getting rid of gender\", I'm almost not even sure what that means, since gender is just a label to *describe* certain behaviors. When you talk about \"getting rid of gender\", are you talking about changing how people act, or just how we describe and group people?

For example, the Pope. Otherwise you're hiding under \"No True Christian\".\n\n\u0026gt;  So, on every front, in every possible way, this is just a silly argument. \n\nIt is silly only if Christians never claimed that their God was perfect along with objective morality as represented by the Bible.

There's nothing in atheism about abortions, killing people, opinions of morality, etc. In addition, plenty of Christians have abortions and plenty support it as well. Lastly, not all atheists support abortion either though that has nothing to do with atheism.\n\n\u0026gt; there's nothing inherently superior about your convictions \n\nI agree, nobody is superior here, not me and not you.\n\n\u0026gt; nothing about the separation of church and state demands that religious folk keep their religion \"in the closet\". \n\nOnly when it affects other people.

{"body":"aquentin answered better than I can, but let me add:  \n\nThe problem with your first point you say bitcoin is by definition not centralized, but if the code is mostly produced at Core  then that is still a very centralizing influence.  You have worded away the reality of what they are doing.  It would be like saying \"bitcoin is not centralized so a giant monopoly of miners does not matter.\"  All the  more so if they start changing the original vision which they have.  Additionally they don't seem too concerned about that drastic monopolistic centralization threat that they themselves impose.  Furthermore they are not getting community consensus.  See the soft forks issue.\n\nThe problem with your second point is: I said \"conflict of interest\".  They are acting on it, but that is not necessary to establish.  Read the definition.  \n\nThe problem with your third point is that soft forks put off the issue of establishing consensus.  In this manner they force people in through a sort of de facto method.  That's why it is passive aggressive.  In reality people will be doing regular upgrades or downloading the client.  They are never presented with a real choice.  That is the reality when they control 90% of the clients.  It is not so easy to op out as you make it sound.\n\nThe problem with your fourth point is that you changed the topic to whether or not Core is deliberately capping transactions.   That's a trickier issue, I believe they are, but it was not the main point.  The point was that **if** they do **then** according to Metcalfe's law price won't increase anymore and I argue it would go to ZERO.

If that price is rejected, enter on the close. Requires a lot of patience.\n\nIn the GBPUSD chart, you're looking for a reversal. In the long term trend. I'll ignore the volume profiles for now. You're looking for a consolidation after two consecutive highs (the consolidation should be after a sharp drop which evidently means that there has been a change in view for the mean time). You're looking for position accumulation within this consolidation. You then wait for price to run up and fill the inefficiency from the drop, but price must not make a new high.

Very discrete with the right clothing, you can just barely make it out in the top left jumper here: [http://imgur.com/PEmBzCq](http://imgur.com/PEmBzCq)\n\nOther option is basically a chest mount reserve using a swiss seat harness (plus a chest loop so you don't fall out) made out of two 120CM climbing slings, 2 or 3 carabiners, and an ultralight paraglider reserve (around 1.5lbs) that'll look like this: [http://superflyinc.com/product/fly-neo-container/](http://superflyinc.com/product/fly-neo-container/). You clip it to your harness and throw it out to deploy. Some reserves are only rated to a deployment speed around 60mph (~Cessna 182 exit speed), but a few are rated up to about 110mph which is enough for almost any other skydiving planes.

The bugs will be back no later than Teusday if you want to fight them, and the campaign balance will likely be adjusted so the war lasts longer this time.\n\nI really wish we had some short-term event objectives that built up to the homeworld assault, so that way wars could last longer while still providing a steady supply of that \"We did it!\" winning feeling.

This would let small powers still over fortify so people aren't left out of gaining merits just because all the systems are filled before players get a chance to come home from work, etc.\n\nFurthermore, this one is more controversial.  Any supplies over 100% would be able to be picked up by someone else to deliver to a different location.\n\nThe thing about this, though is merit farmers will both spread the 7900% fortification to other systems but they may spread it to others below the line.

[This is an example](http://iksprivateserver.com/) of the most common one.\n\nI'm in canada, so there are few canadian options that sell via resellers on kijiji. They have more HD channels and are slightly more reliable. Both still get overwhelmed during prime time. The canadian example is [tecfont](http://www.tecfront.ca/). I like them because they don't sell via a reseller. So you get proper direct support. Sometimes mistakes happen with resellers and you MAC address can get banned and you won't get tv while that is sorted out.\n\nThen there are foreign providers. Being in these other countries means they can operate like a business since they mostly avoid the legal issues. \n\nI currently use a mag 254 and use it with [Bestiptv](http://arab-iptv.com/bestiptv-for-mag-1-month-subscription/). At this level now we have a provider that provides good support, and now pretty much all the channels are HD and they offer multiple servers, so geographically your covered. Even in primetime I don't have buffering. This now basically now comparable to regular cable/sat, at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe only provider I've found that has more to offer is [tvaway](https://tvaway.wordpress.com/tag/mag-254/). They have multiple servers, full guide information, VOD for movies, but they also offer VOD for most tv shows for the last 14 days. This catchup service sets them apart.

I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.\n\n\"An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.\n\n\"My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.\n\n\"I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).\n\n\"I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.\n\n\"Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.\n\n\"I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\n\n\"I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\n\n\"I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\n\"I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.\n\n\"I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for *everyone*.\n\n\"I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.\n\n\"The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.\n\n\"I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.\n\n\"That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because *all humans* do that).\n\n\"I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).\n\n\"And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.\n\n\"All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

{"body":"I used to think this concept was bullshit, but in a lot of states, there is no legal requirement for the patron to present an ID.  There is often no legal compulsion for the establishment to *require* ID.  \n\nIn my state, it's illegal for establishments to serve minors, but the state leaves it up to the establishment to figure out how to determine people are of age.  This is usually done by IDing people before service or even before entry.\n\nServing a minor is a big deal, and you could face fines, get yourself barred from selling alcohol (no more FOH jobs), or even jail time.  But serving a person who is probably of age but who doesn't have a valid ID isn't really a problem.  The real problem is that if you end up serving a minor with a fake ID that you didn't thoroughly check (or is obviously fake), you lose some protection from liability. \n\nThat being said, you should follow your company's policies to keep your job.  Remember, your job is more important than someone drinking a beer.\n\nCould the guy have had a state-issued, non-drivers-license ID?","score":"7","subreddit":"TalesFromYourServer"}
