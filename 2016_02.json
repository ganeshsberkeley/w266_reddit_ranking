Murswiek war für die Aktion von dem rechtsextremen Deutschen Studenten-Anzeiger besonders gelobt worden (Ausgabe 48 von 1970 zeigt ein Foto der Aktion und enthält ein ausführliches Interview mit ihm).

But many studies have shown that there is a large discrepance between parent-reported and clinically confirmed food allergy *in the same study participants*. \nExamples:\n\n**Jansen, J. J., Kardinaal, A. F., Huijbers, G., Vlieg-Boerstra, B. J., Martens, B. P. \u0026amp; Ockhuizen, T. (1994). Prevalence of food allergy and intolerance in the adult Dutch population. J Allergy Clin Immunol, 93(2), 446-456.**\n\n10% self-reported vs. 2.4% confirmed by the gold standard, a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC).\n\n**Young, E., Stoneham, M. D., Petruckevitch, A., Barton, J. \u0026amp; Rona, R. (1994). A population study of food intolerance. Lancet, 343(8906), 1127-1130.**\n\n20.4 vs. 2,4, same method\n\n**Zuberbier, T., Edenharter, G., Worm, M., Ehlers, I., Reimann, S., Hantke, T.et al. (2004). Prevalence of adverse reactions to food in Germany - a population study. Allergy, 59(3), 338-345.**\n\n34.9 vs. 4.2%, confirmed by an open food challenge (OFC). \n\nThe questions used to assess self-reported food allergy differ and are often not reported verbatim. Because they also function as screening questions for further assessment direct comparisons of the numbers estimated in these studies are not possible, even if they theoretically used the same methods. \n\n**Kaya, A., Erkoçoğlu, M., Civelek, E., Çakır, B. \u0026amp; Kocabaş, C. N. (2013). Prevalence of confirmed IgE-mediated food allergy among adolescents in Turkey. Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, 24(5), 456-462.**\n\n11.2% vs. 1,3%, confirmed in this case by a detailed telephone anamnesis.\n\nThere are more studies that show the same effect, at different magnitudes in different populations. So there is no way to say, 'doesn't matter, if the Asians self-reported allergy is 10 times higher than that of native children, it's still lower'. This study tells us about the prevalence of self-reported food allergy, which correlates only somewhat with the disease 'food allergy'.\n\nThere is an epidemic of self-reported food allergy. If actual food allergy is rising, there have not yet been sufficient studies to show that. To show an increase in food allergy, you need to repeat the same study, with the same methods, if you're asking questions to screen, they have to be identical, not just similar.\n\nA recent study measured prevalences of food allergy in infants in several European countries. They chose to publish by allergen, so there are only results available for cow's milk and hen's egg, the most commonly \nencountered food allergies in that population.\n\nThe estimated prevalences were: cow's milk 0.47%(!), of which half the children tolerated the food a year later.\n\n**Schoemaker, A. A., Sprikkelman, A. B., Grimshaw, K. E., Roberts, G., Grabenhenrich, L., Rosenfeld, L.et al. (2015). Incidence and natural history of challenge-proven cow's milk allergy in European children - EuroPrevall birth cohort. Allergy.**\n\nHen's egg prevalence was 1.23 %, also half of the children tolerated it again when challenged a year later.\n\n**Xepapadaki, P., Fiocchi, A., Grabenhenrich, L., Roberts, G., Grimshaw, K. E., Fiandor, A.et al. (2016). Incidence and natural history of hen's egg allergy in the first 2 years of life-the EuroPrevall birth cohort study. Allergy, 71(3), 350-357.**\n\nSo while this study also cannot shed light on time trends, it shows that the actual prevalences for even the most common allergens in infancy are very, very low, making this, in fact, a rare disease (the reason the other prevalences have not yet been published is the unfortunate publishing policy decision top publish by allergens. All other prevalences measured are lower, sometimes much lower). This is very contrary to how it is perceived in public and even some parts of the scientific community. The study continues now to follow up the same kids in school age.\n","score":"370","subreddit":"science"}

{"body":"Nah.  It's actually a very common application of the term.\n\nYeah.  It entails a bit of antromorphic goofiness in that you're ascribing aspects to something making it look like an agent with volition.\n\nBut essentially the idea is that in Science (and Engineering, and Math) a ton of stuff cannot be determined exactly.  But you can determine certain aspects of the item in question.  Let's say, for example, that X is actually in reality 45,332,491.  But af first all you know is that it really cannot be negative.  Even there, you've constrained the things's ability to be negative.  You've ascertained that it cannot be negative so you constrain it as if you're telling it that it cannot be negative.  Eventually you work out an upper bound... it cannot be more than ten quadrillion.\n\nEach of these pieces of the puzzle are called constraints.  You can iist them out.  So far, we have two.  You keep working it at until you've got lots more constraints and the item is very tightly constrained as to what it could be.

Kathleen Matthews, funded by Hillary donors, is running for the U.S. House of Representatives for Maryland's 8th congressional district.{[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTuMnN4wvBY)}{[2](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/09/hillary-donors-helping-chris-matthews-wife-into-congress/)}{[3](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/13/ten-thousand-demand-chris-matthews-suspension-msnbc-silent/)}.  Watch the vid in link{1}, Chris Matthews is heavily biased.\n\nThis explains how Capehart's smears went unchallenged. A prominent progressive site has called for MSNBC to suspend Chris Matthews for continued shilling and bias. [link removed - it violates the rules?]\n\nDanny Lyon the original photographer, heard of the smears and [posted additional negatives to his blog](https://dektol.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/more-bernie-civil-rights-photos-found) proving the man [in the original photo](https://dektol.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-29-at-6-49-15-pm.png) was Sanders.  On Friday Feb 12, Capeheart repeated his claims live [on MSNBC Andrea Mitchell Reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak3RDTOUJHY). \n\nCapehart failed to disclose a direct conflict of interest acknowledging [his long term romantic relationship with long time Clinton staffer Nick Schmit](http://capitolfile-magazine.com/inside-jonathan-capehart-and-nick-schmits-house) and refuses to print a retraction or apologize. It's a pretty transparent hit piece attempting to discredit Sanders civil rights record in the lead up to the South Carolina primary on Feb 27.\n\nTo maintain ethical integrity and standards of a news outlet and as a journalist you are supposed to disclose conflicts or avoid them entirely. \n\nSchmit [has worked for the Clintons in various capacities since 2004-2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20160215055916/https://twitter.com/McSquirmishes/status/699032420029337601) as an employee of the Clinton Foundation, staff on Hillary's 2008 campaign, and subsequently moved to the US State Department in 2009 under Hillary where he has remained as a GS-14 Schedule C appointment [maybe his job is in jeopardy next year if Clinton doesn't win].\n\n[Additional info about Capehart and Schmit](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/45q5mx/proclinton_columnist_in_bed_with_clinton_staffer/czzhd10)\n\n","score":"15","subreddit":"politics"}

{"body":"It really started during the Reagan administration- if you wanted to have back channel info, if you wanted to have your rep called on in the White House Press Briefing, you wrote what you were told to write. Critical articles resulted in journalistic exile- no access, no questions answered, and so on. \n\nThere was a concerted effort on the part of the Reagan administration to \"package\" the news so that only the stories they wanted told got told. From \"On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency, by Mark Hertsgaard, 1988\n\n\u0026gt; The \"killers\" primarily responsible for generating positive press coverage of Reagan were Michael Deaver and David Gergen, and if they did not exactly get away with murder, they came pretty close. Deaver, Gergen and their colleagues effectively rewrote the rules of presidential image-making. On the basis of a sophisticated analysis of the American news media-how it worked, which buttons to push when, what techniques had and had not worked for previous administrations-they introduced a new model for packaging the nation's top politician and using the press to sell him to the American public. Their objective was not simply to tame the press but to transform it into an unwitting mouthpiece of the government; it was one of Gergen's guiding assumptions that the administration simply could not govern effectively unless it could \"get the right story out\" through the \"filter\" of the press.\n\n\u0026gt; The extensive public relations apparatus assembled within the Reagan White House did most of its work out of sight-in private White House meetings each morning to set the \"line of the day\" that would later be fed to the press; in regular phone calls to the television networks intended to influence coverage of Reagan on the evening news; in quiet executive orders imposing extraordinary new government secrecy measures, including granting the FBI and CIA permission to infiltrate the press. It was Mike Deaver's special responsibility to provide a constant supply of visually attractive, prepackaged news stories-the kind that network television journalists in particular found irresistible. Of course, it helped enormously that the man being sold was an ex-Hollywood actor. As James Lake, press secretary of the Reagan-Bush campaign, acknowledged, Ronald Reagan was \"the ultimate presidential commodity . . . the right product.\"\n\nThe result today is as long as the press thinks a politician has *their* best interests at heart (ie: corporate profits, etc.), they get whatever story they want to get published. Right now, it's Clinton who owns the corporate press in the 2016 Democratic campaign, although the Obama administration owns it just as much when it comes to national policy.

{"body":"I support Hillary Clinton because she has always been a strong advocate of minority rights, particularly for African-Americans and gay rights, she has advocated for healthcare reform for many years, and she has a balanced view on energy and climate issues. Bernie Sanders, while I respect him a great deal, is simply not ready for the task of being President. He has barely breathed a word about foreign policy during his interviews and in the debates. How will he handle ISIS? Putin? Most importantly, in my opinion, people want real, progressive change in America and Clinton has made reasonable proposals to do that (such as raising the minimum wage to 12 dollars, vs Sanders' 15 dollars). Moreover, his plan to make public colleges completely \"free,\" along with his other expensive policies, will cause taxes to skyrocket. People think that us Clinton supporters, especially on Reddit, are just dumb people who don't know who Sanders is. I truly respect him, but I just don't him in the White House.\n\nEdit: Since radiant_snowdrop mentioned the issue of Sanders supporters' \"toxicity,\" I would just like to add that I do agree that many Sanders supporters on the internet have been extremely counterproductive in spreading Bernie Sanders' message. However, I do not feel that is reflective of Sanders as a candidate and as a person, since he has run a mostly clean campaign. Perhaps he can be a little divisive, but he has gone on the record totally disowning the bullying tactics of the \"BernieBros\" and has committed to raising the issues that matter with respect and with class. \n\nAlso, from what I've heard from people who have met and spoken with Hillary Clinton, she is a very kind, compassionate person who does truly care about the people. I feel like reddit has this Marie Antoinette perception of her which, in my view, isn't true. I fully understand disagreeing with her on policy (I too have a few differences on political issues with her) but we really need to stay away from the personal attacks, otherwise we are no better than Trump.","score":"-4","subreddit":"politics"}

The 37th percentile of american household earnings is around $39,000 in 2014.\n\nhttp://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2014/09/what-is-your-income-percentile-ranking.html#.VrrmuzYrIUE\n\n$500 is 500/39000 or 1.3% of annual earnings.\n\nI think it's very scary if someone can be \"crushed\" by an unexpected 1.3% annual expense.\n\nI mean, $500 is, what... a relatively minor repair on a reasonably priced car? $500 might be the cost of a new water pump. Or a set of four tires plus mounting, balancing, and disposal fee. $500 can be the cost of a regular maintenance, like oil + tranny fluid + cheap brakes + coolant. Pretty much everyone drives, so it's pretty relatable.\n\nIt's insane not to have a few bucks set aside for unexpected bills like $500.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse. Let's simplify and assume a linear distribution of people whom it would crush based on income; that means a household in the 63rd percentile may very well still fall in that category. That's $73,000ish household income. If I was shocked that a family earning $39k would be \"crushed\" by a $500 bill, then permit me to be astonished that anyone in the 63rd percentile can't manage a $500 (0.7% annual gross earnings) surprise bill. And to relate it to the usual suspect of unexpected expenses, a family with gross earnings of $73k probably has one or two new or relatively new (if relatively inexpensive) cars, where a non-warranty repair could easily run a thousand bucks, where even a standard service might cost your $500 (see what a low-end BMW costs to change the battery at a dealer.)","score":"28","subreddit":"politics"}

Being too stubborn to admit a mistake, in my opinion, is incredibly dishonorable to all of the soldiers that died over there.  It's not about Democrats vs Republicans in the context of the Iraq War.  We need to learn from it (both sides do, really), so we don't make a commitment like that again that cost our soldiers lives for an outcome that likely (at least in my opinion) wasn't worth those lost lives.\n\nTrump being able to come out against that isn't the only reason I will probably support him, but if I'm looking at all of the other Republican candidates and they aren't willing to criticize the Iraq War, I have a serious issue trusting any of them with our country's military.

Personally, I never heard of them prior to them getting Al Gore to Enschede. It is a non-profit organisation apparently.\n\nLooking back, I cannot find confirmation about Al Gore's price. I am almost certain I read he got paid 100k in euros, which was $137k at the time. (Due to the weakening Euro, it's $111k nowadays). Internet searches regarding his speaking fees in general seem to confirm this number.\n\nThe ticket prices were 1250 euro's by the way. This is for one single day with some talks and some great network opportunities according to their pamphlet. Basically a steal at such low prices.\n\nI can see how this is really attractive for a certain breed of person. But I don't think there'll be many events were I would feel more out of place than that. (I love going to speeches and such. It's more that I don't really belong among the type of person that spends over a thousand dollars for networking purposes)\n\nAnyway. I don't really disagree that the Clinton speaking fees are pretty sketchy. She got over $600k from Goldman Sachs in speaking fees alone in one year. You're not going to tell me she wasn't planning on running for president then. \n\nI think campaign contributions through SuperPAC's from hedge bankers are harder to defend though. In these cases they directly contribute to her election.\n \nWith the speeches you can still point to people like Al Gore, who also take big amounts of money in speaking fees. If you combine this with the argument that she wasn't planning running for president back then (I don't believe that for one bit), and you have a line of defence. That is, if it weren't for the sources saying she sounded like a Goldman Sachs CEO during these talks.\n\nWith the SuperPAC's, it's literally because they expect to be better off.

Since 2008, Clinton has been the presumptive front-runner and nobody has really come up to challenge so she ended up the de-facto nominee...and it was assumed that nobody from the Republican side would be able to mount a serious challenge so Clinton and the DNC were all but ready to have her anointed President.\n\nThen Sanders threw in and it's exposed the worst possible aspects of Clinton.  She's still the front runner and still has the best chance at the nomination but she's been seriously wounded and the right has been energized against her so she would face  an uphill battle in the general.  Sanders, even if he manages to eke out a victory in the nomination probably wouldn't do too well in the general , for a lot of reasons.  And should he happen to win, his coat-tails are very short and he won't get much support in Congress (of course, neither will Clinton but for different reasons)\n\nSo a year ago, the CW was the Clinton would walk her way into the White House but now the Democrats face a hard battle just to get there (keeping in mind it's very difficult for one party to control the presidency for more than two terms anyway) and even if they do it will be a pyrrhic victory.\n\nThe DNC's best hope was Biden running and they should've spent the last few years grooming a couple of alternatives, but they just sorta gave it to Clinton and it's come back to haunt them \n\nThe Democrats really misplayed this election cycle\n\nEdit: added some corrections and some improvements","score":"57","subreddit":"politics"}

{"body":"The LIBOR rigging scandal has only gotten weirder as time has gone on. For those that don't know what it is about, LIBOR is a rate that some of the major banks charge each other for short-term loans. These rates are used as benchmarks across the world for variable rate debt. For example, if you have a adjustable rate loan on your house, its probably based on LIBOR + x%. Every month (or whatever time period chosen) LIBOR is updated, and that's your new interest rate is set. \n\nOne of the chief guys in the case, Tom Hayes, was convicted of rigging this rate by convincing traders, who worked at the banks that set the LIBOR rates, to push the rate in certain directions at certain times. A common example was that he would convince them to push the rate slightly higher on the 1st of the month, since the majority of adjustable rate home loans reset on that day. Hayes would then make a profit on that spread. However, every one of the traders he supposedly convinced to manipulate the rates was just acquitted. They all argued that they told him that they would manipulate the rates for him, and then just didn't. They just told the gullible trader what he wanted to hear. So Tom Hayes is now convicted of creating a conspiracy that manipulated LIBOR without any actual conspirators. \n\nThe LIBOR scandal is full of things likes this. There are literally thousands of examples of the traders trying to manipulate the LIBOR through chat rooms and email. Banks have settled these cases for billions of dollars/euros. But the thing is, those guys were on opposite sides of the trades. For every guy trying to push the rates upward by calling traders at the banks, there were guys trying to push the rates downward. This happened so much that the regulators have never been able to determine the net impact. Which is really weird considering rigging normally implies artificially manipulating the rate so one side wins all the time. It was almost like the free market (supply and demand) was working, except it was setting the LIBOR rate through everyone trying to manipulate it rather than actual supply and demand for short-term inter-bank loans. \n\nIt all comes back to the fact that LIBOR is just this weird artificial number. The LIBOR rate is somewhat similar to what the FED rate is. Banks in the U.S. use the FED for overnight loans to meet their capital requirements, and they pay the FED rate. The LIBOR rate is supposed to be a similar tool; banks in the U.K./Europe supposedly borrow in the short-term from each other at this rate. However, none of them really actually borrow from each other at this rate at all. So LIBOR is just this artificial benchmark that everyone pins their adjustable rate debt to, but no one actually borrows money at.\n\nLike I said, the LIBOR scandal is weird.","score":"113","subreddit":"politics"}

{"body":"It doesn't. This is something that a lot of white Sanders supporters don't quite understand, and it's one of the reasons the \"Bernie bros\" shit has become so popular. A lot of White Sanders supporters use the fact that Bernie marched with King as some sort of end all be all. Almost like a trump card that makes Sanders beyond reproach when it comes to racial issues, and that doesn't play well with most African Americans. For example, I personally think that using that point is condescending as hell. Firstly, because it presupposes that marching with MLK was some kind of extraordinary act. It wasn't. Anyone who considered themselves to be a good, fair minded, person should've been marching with MLK. So Im not about to praise someone for doing something that they were supposed to do, especially grown adults. I reserve that behavior for children. \n\nSecondly, because I don't base my political decisions on shit you did 50 years ago. I don't really give a fuck who you marched with when my mom was 9 years old, I care about what policies that you have pushed for today and in the recent past. That is what will sway my opinion, not some walk you took with a dude I never even met, especially since I don't know the exact level of involvement Sanders had with the civil rights movement. \n\nThirdly, the argument just isn't a very convincing one. Jessie Jackson was damn near MLK's right hand man when compared to Sanders and I couldn't give two shits about Jackson. In fact, most of the white Sanders supporters making this argument couldn't give two shits about Jackson. And im willing to guess that you guys have never considered voting for Jackson, eventhough he too walked for MLK, which goes to show just how much of a shit argument it is. \n\nSo in conclusion, the fact that Sanders marched with MLK isn't as important as many white Sanders supporters think it is. In fact the average black voter who would vote for Sanders couldn't give two shits about who he marched with and are much more concerned about healthcare, minimum wage, and student loan reform.","score":"29","subreddit":"politics"}

{"body":"You know what's a fucking disgrace? Our \"democratic privilege.\"\n\nEvery single time we vote for any position at a federal level, we get to cast a single vote for a single candidate. The number of options we have on the ballot for that position is typically no greater than four, though in reality, it's almost never greater than two: Republican or Democrat. Those two candidates are selected by a farcical \"democratic\" process, and the controls for that process have no connection to our constitution. \n\nOn the executive level, well, we're witnessing exactly what kind of shit show that selection process can be, filled with disproportional weight towards early states (despite their size or voting base), bizarre caucuses, and vastly varying voter requirements and affiliations. And we're not even discussing campaign donors, super PACs, and the fact that the party doesn't even have to give us any options (as they typically don't with incumbent presidents. [Also, if it weren't for Sanders, the Democratic Party wouldn't have offered anyone other than Hillary this year.]) Of course, that's only on the executive level. On a congressional level, this selection process can happen almost entirely behind closed doors. If nothing else, the doors are deliberately hard to get through.\n\nThis all means that when we cast a vote in an election, we don't get to cast a vote for who we think is best for our views or who we honestly think should win. Instead we get to take our one vote, and cast a strategic vote for one of two options, and hope that vote has some wight. If you're someone who distances yourself from our Nation's embarrassing two-party system, than you had absolutely no say in either of those candidates getting the nomination. And don't bite your fucking thumb at us Independents, because we're the ones who actually decide the elections.\n\nSo, after all of that, what our \"democratic privilege\" means is that instead of having no choice at all, we get to pick one of two. The way I see it, we are one option away from oligarchy. And honestly, both options look pretty fucking similar to me.\n\nAnd you know what? We haven't even reached the worst of it.\n\nOn an executive level, we all know our vote means next to nothing, because that vote is grouped into a single vote with everyone else in our state, and that state's vote is cast proportionally with our congressional representation. We all know how bullshit this is, because we all got a first hand lesson in the short-comings of the electoral college in 2000. That election is the defining election for millennials, partially because it's the first election many of us voted, and partially because we all remember the media circus that bullshit became. What's more, we have yet to be offered a reason for why nothing has changed.\n\nBut Oh, what about the mid-term elections? What about the House and the Senate? In 2012 there were 45 candidates that ran unopposed in the House. In 2014, there were 77. At the state level, it is estimated that nearly 33% of candidates run unopposed. I literally went to vote in my last election in my district last November, and there was one person running opposed on my entire ballot. And I live in New York City.\n\nStill, assuming your choice has been increased from one to two, and you  do have someone to vote for, you're probably fucked, anyway. If your voice has any hope of affecting change, it can (and probably will) be divided and dissolved by the currently leading party. Such was the case in my former home state of North Carolina in 2012, where a majority of voters voted for the democratic party's candidate in their district, yet Republicans won nine of thirteen congressional seats.\n\nAre there solutions to all of these issues? Yes, their certainly are. They aren't perfect, but they're pretty fucking effective and they're exercised in a majority of other democracies throughout the world. Will they change here? Probably not, because the two parties in control are just that: in control. They stand nothing to gain and everything to lose if they make our voting proportional, or if they allow us to vote alternatively.\n\nTo be clear, I always vote. However, it is ignorant to assume that our vote is a privilege, and frankly, it's offensive. Our vote is what makes our country a Democracy, it is what defines our freedom. Our vote is a right, and right now, it doesn't mean shit.","score":"31","subreddit":"politics"}

{"body":"**Item #:** SCP-2403\n\n**Object class:** ~~Safe~~ Euclid\n\n**Special containment procedures:**\n\n~~Agents embedded in the authorities responsible for the allocation of radio frequencies all over the world are to ensure that there is a 0-24 commercial radio station on SCP-2403-2's frequency, suppressing its signal. In inhabited areas not covered by commercial radio stations, Foundation antennas disguised as local vegetation should broadcast white noise on said frequency.~~\n\n~~Updated on 200█/02/04:~~\n\n~~Due to the anomalous properties of SCP-2403-2 and its most recent method of propagation, containment is effectively impossible. MTF-ρ21 (\"Radio Silence\") should attempt to seek out SCP-2403-1. MTF-ρ21 should not seek out affected people and should suppress information about SCP-2403.~~\n\nUpdated on 201█/05/15:\n\nDue to the anomalous properties of SCP-2403-2 and its most recent method of propagation, containment is effectively impossible. MTF-ρ21 (\"Radio Silence\") should attempt to seek out SCP-2403-1. Due to the growing prevalence of SCP-2403-sensitivity in the general population, MTF-ρ21 is authorized to seek out people affected by SCP-2403-2 to accomplish this goal. SCP-2403-sensitive D-Class are to be exempt from monthly termination, contingent on their willingness to share information about SCP-2403.\n\n**Description:**\n\nSCP-2403 is an anomalous FM radio broadcast, available globally on the 10█.█ MHz frequency between midnight (according to local time) and the local sunrise. For unaffected people, the broadcast appears as radio static. However, in ~~0.0█%~~ 0.██%^(See update 2) of humans this white noise causes auditory hallucinations of music they find extremely appealing. ~~Other radio stations operating on the same frequency seem to nullify this effect.~~^(See update 1) This music will never match any released music. Voice pattern analysis on the auditory memories extracted from an affected D-Class using SCP-████ didn't give any results.\n\nSCP-2403 appears to be extremely addictive. People who have listened to it regularly will start to ignore their social responsibilities, adopt a nocturnal behavior, and become obsessed with finding the songs they have heard on the station and more information about the station. Upon the cessation of broadcast, or on days when the station doesn't broadcast (the appearance of these days shows positive correlation with solar activity) regular listeners will become depressed, consistent with usual stimulant withdrawal symptoms.\n\n**Update 1:** as of 200█/02/04, apparently in response to the Foundation's containment efforts, SCP-2403's signal changed. Starting from this date, SCP-2403's anomalous effects manifest regardless of other broadcasts or white noise on SCP-2403-2's frequency. Containment procedures updated accordingly.\n\n**Update 2:** on 201█/05/13, an SCP-2403-sensitive D-Class reported hearing numbers on the station. The coordinates pointed to a location in Death Valley. MTF-ρ21 was mobilized and sent to the location, but found nothing. Autonomous surveillance was set up as a precautionary measure. On on 201█/05/14 an unidentified civilian (later identified by the license plate as E███ L█████) was seen riding into the area on a motorcycle. A broadcast tower (designated SCP-2403-1) appeared for 11.7 seconds then both the broadcast tower and the rider have disappeared. As of 201█/05/15, the prevalence of SCP-2403-sensitivity has increased from 0.0█% to 0.██%, prompting the upgrade of SCP-2403's class from Safe to Euclid.","score":"31","subreddit":"comics"}

While Daoism is quite anarchist (more precisely based around naturalism and esoteric mysticism), it doesn't really hold any significant ground in Chinese philosophical framework regarding politics or ethics in the recent 2000 years. Due to it's naturally anarchistic framework, it never gained significant sponsorship from the dominant state powers. Daoism is highly influential in Chinese art, literature, and religion, but it's not nearly as influential as some of the other movements (Mohism, Legalism, Neo-Confucianism) in governing Chinese thought on Ethics and Politics. \n\nBuddhist on the other-hand is actually extremely collectivist, (perhaps only second to Mohism). The idea of universal reincarnation essentially means your existence is tied to the framework of any universal being. The ethics of Buddhism rarely concerns itself with how to govern, which is party why it has been so popular under different ruling dynasties. \n\nIf anyone here is interested in these things, I highly recommend doing a quick reading on these different schools of Chinese thought. Some of the concepts such as Mohist's concept of [universal love and utilitarian ethics](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/), and the Legalist concept of [equality under the law](\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)\") while disregarding noble standing and kinship are really leaps and bounds ahead of their time.\n","score":"70","subreddit":"worldnews"}

Every politician in particular elicits this sort of response. It is truly amazing how many gaps Trump supporters seem willing to fill in with their own details and how large those gaps are.\n\nOn the point at hand, you are correct, he is apparently talking about a direct transfer of funds. [Trump's website says that Mexico will pay directly for the wall and lists the punitive measures he will take to convince Mexico to hand over the money:](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform)\n\n\u0026gt; Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards – of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options].\n\nI would like to hear how many years of these measures it would take to actually pay for the cost of the wall, because obviously Mexico wouldn't hand over any money unless they had good reason to believe that they would lose more due to these tariffs and fees than the cost of the wall. Even that completely ignores the fact that Mexico would respond with it's own economic policy changes to drive up costs for American businesses.\n\nEdit: concluding paragraph","score":"15","subreddit":"worldnews"}

It really doesn't take much for people to drop them like a hot potato. There are plenty of alternatives, and it's relatively easy to maintain your own host and perform backups. If there's any popular tech service we don't need, it's github. They exist through popularity, but popularity can change very quickly. I'd be worried about causing any backlash like this.

And heck its a lot of systems, microcontrollers even. However if one is to write same piece of code in C there is no way to avoid native APIs because its all C has. So burden of portability falls on shoulders of programmer since its not already solved by someone else. And beating portability of CPython is huge endeavour in itself.

I'm talking a thousand at a time.\n\nBecause thinking what I just said is ridiculous tells me you have never lifted communities out of poverty.  Communities come out of poverty by investing into themselves.  That means setting up a situation whereby all of the wealth they generate in their lifetime is funneled into themselves.  Nobody cutting the fat off the top, not paying rent to other people, not paying high bills.  If you want to lift a community out of poverty, that community has to horde wealth for itself.\n\nYou cannot do that if you do not have power over yourself.  If you are poor in a city, you are at the whim of the wealthy.  If you are in a community of equals, you have power over yourself.  The wealth you create stays with you.  Sure, you pay some state and federal taxes, big whoop, the rest stays with you.  When you own your community, when you build your own park, you build the wealth in your home.  Your property value goes up.  When you build your own school, you build your own wealth. When you build a business, your build your own wealth.  Each member of the community feeds back to everyone else, and everyone wins.  The work of each individual is magnified across everyone in the community, because you all share the stake in what is going on.  Nobody is skimming off the top, nobody is leeching from your work.\n\nThis is how you build wealth.  Claiming sitting around in a city is going to build your wealth is stupid.  It will never work, you will stay poor forever, and it is 100% your own personal fault.\n\nYou cannot be the weakest member in society and expect to win.  You have to be among your equals or be the biggest fish in the sea.  Ultimately, the powerful win.  If you want to win, make yourself powerful.\n\nAlso, it is frankly absurd to claim growing your own food is difficult.  I grow enough food to feed myself as a hobby, I put in probably 5 minutes per day.  Growing food isn't hard.  I grow about 200 pounds of potatoes per year, plus loads of herbs.

So that makes for some very weak strategies on their part because instead of trying to set up a real trap, they're looking for the sucker strike. So the way you beat them, catch them cheating...take away the illegal move they worked so hard to set up, and they're suddenly in horrible position and you can literally wipe them out.

{"body":"Ancient Egypt person here, from all the research I've done, it really depends on where in Egypt, and when you are talking about. In general it goes from darker in the Old Kingdom to lighter and more near eastern/Mediterranean in the New Kingdom and beyond.\n\nI'll say this, the ancient Egyptians were used to \"black\" people living in their population. Especially Nubians, like in this relief here:\nhttps://mathildasanthropologyblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/nubian-tribute.jpg\n\nHell, Nubians once ruled Egypt for a few centuries as pharaohs themselves. They weren't a aberration in the Egyptian world.\n\nI think this is actually the most telling evidence that the Egyptians themselves weren't black, because they did show black people alongside Egyptians, but you could find Egyptians in art that go from very dark, like queen Tiye:\nhttp://johnoehler.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Tiye-same-statue-as-above-Agyptisches-Museum-Berlin.jpg\n\nto more \"middle-eastern\": http://www.zonein.com.au/history/egypt/the_scribe/images/the_scribe_04.jpg\n\nI actually liked Exodus(even though so much of that movie was shit), because a fair chunk of the people in it definitely *could* have been New Kingdom Egyptians. They were all on the lighter side of things, but I thought it was a relatively believable effort. Gods of Egypt is different because they are for the most part egregiously white. They really don't seem to even make the attempt.\n\nThe Egyptians themselves were definitely as a majority, closer to what we would see as near-eastern, but they were certainly not the same, nor were they far removed from darker African peoples.

{"body":"There was this girl in class (who I had been involved with previously) who refused to leave me alone for a solid 15 minutes. After asking her to leave me alone multiple times, and explaining that I was busy (finals), she got mad and slapped me. \n\nWe had computer chairs in this class, and I just pushed her away. She slid across the room and fell over, then left me the fuck alone.\n\nAn hour later her ex boyfriend, who was also a friend of mine, came up to me, grabbed me by the throat, and started screaming at me, telling me how I should never hit a girl and so forth. Luckily, my friends, who were pretty big, separated us and I explained what had actually happened.\n\nHe didn't know she had hit me, more or less out of nowhere, and didn't know that I didn't hit her. She had told him I did it out of nowhere and he took her word at face value. Once he heard my side of the story he calmed down, remembered how abusive of a chick she actually was, and apologized.\n\nGuys lose in this scenario more often than not, even if it's in self defense, and very rarely do people listen to their side of the story.\n\n\nEdit: Just for a little clarification, the guy was a good kid and this event was completely out of character. We weren't best friends or anything, but we did talk and hang out a bit before this (and before either of us had dated the girl). We never really talked again after this, but he did apologize again a few days later after he had completely cooled off. As for the girl, no idea. Spoke a few years ago and she was still a raging bitch, so I cut that real quick.\n\nEdit 2: She wasn't always a raging bitch. I had known her for a few years before we briefly dated and she was always wonderful, until she started dating this one kid. He was an abusive, lying, druggy, thief and she never recovered, I think. We started dating after she had split with him (because he was in rehab for heroin, again), and I couldn't handle her like that. She did a complete 180 from what I knew and it wasn't what I had hoped for.\n\nThis specific event happened a year-ish later.","score":"381","subreddit":"videos"}

We hung out in my room until I think around 11 PM talking and exchanged phone numbers and Facebook info.\n\nAfter we became friends, he asked me if I wanted to eat dinner with him and his roommate one night and I agreed. At dinner I asked him if he wanted to go with me to a dance our school was going to be having, and he agreed.\n\nThat dance actually happened at the beginning of last month. It played a part in helping us get together, but it wasn't the whole reason for it. We were hanging out one night, I think the night I got back to campus for the beginning of the semester, and out of nowhere I was just like \"Would it be weird if I kissed you?\" It was totally weird, but it started us talking about being in a relationship. We agreed that night that we weren't going to rush into anything and that the dance, about a week away at that point, was going to be our first official date. That was only sort of true. The dance was out first real date, but we kind of became a couple a few days earlier by accident. I was brought in front of the school's student judicial system for something stupid I did (got off with a warning, first offense) and I was freaking out afterwards and so I called my boyfriend to help me calm down. He held me and talked me out of my half-cry-half-rage, and we realized that we were pretty much dating already in every sense of the word short of actually doing it.","score":"13","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"Black people calling themselves \"African Americans\", yet they don't know what country their family hails from. Referring to Africa as one giant country instead of a continent, makes no sense whatsoever, and it makes them look very ignorant. Idris Elba doesn't go about his life calling himself \"African British\", or \"Sierra Leonean English\", or any nonsense like that. He's just British. Same principle applies to them, they're just American, nothing more.\n\nBy that logic, any other Americans could call themvelves \"European American\", but they don't do that, they specify the country their ancestors came from (German Americans, for instance), as if they were in the US \"just passing through\", and could return to the Old Continent and be embraced like one of them, when that's not the case. Someone born and raised in the US will never be the same as someone born and raised in Germany - starting by speaking the language and having dual citizenship, which 99% of the times they don't have.\n\nIn any case, I'll never understand it.\n\nEDIT: I see a common explanation being used... I believe that stating \"well, they didn't migrate on their own will back then, and their ancestry is lost on them, so it makes it somewhat easier for them to connect with their roots like that\", I don't think that's quite valid. Just like someone pointed out down in the comments, Australians came from all over the place, against their will, yet they're all Australians, with their own idiosyncrasy and cultural values, all of which makes them unabashedly Aussie, not \"Welsh-Australian\", or \"English-Australian\". A lot of Welsh, Irish, English and Scots criminals and undesirable people were literally kicked out of Europe (at the time, they were no better than slaves) and dumped in Australia hundreds of years ago, however, most (if not all, *dare I say*) of the Aussie population doesn't harken back to their long lost Scottish or Welsh ascendancy. Because of this, I think Australia is a great example of a group of people *fully embracing* their nationality and making it their own.\n\nPerhaps a few more Aussies could chime in and comment further on this.","score":"1275","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

There's a high chance that she is humble and doesn't have female arrogance. One that does most likely spends most of their time out on dates getting free food and not in the supermarket preparing meals in a frugal yet creative way. \n\nCreativity is important to me in a woman, along with frugality to a lesser extent. \n\nThe common factor is the rejection, that's true.

I think we Americans should be blaming the jingoistic propoganda that dictated what was taught to us in school. I went all the way through high school thinking that the D-Day invasion by America, Britain, and Canada was the turning point for the defeat of Germany. I've become somewhat of a history buff since then and I am constantly trying to educate anyone that will listen that Germany was essentially defeated as soon as it failed to reach Moscow because of the immense sacrifice of the Russian people. They are blown away when I start to mention numbers of Russian soldiers killed and the number of German soldiers that were killed by the Russians on the Eastern front versus the number killed by the Allies in the west. It's no comparison in regards to influence in the outcome of the war. Most Americans have never heard that Russians refer to WWII as the Great Patriotic War. Russia lost around 80,000 troops in the battle for Berlin alone. I haven't found any American that knowingly dismisses Russia's contribution, our education system has just failed us miserably. We were taught how evil Stalin was to his own people, but not the immense sacrifice of the Russian people. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm an extremely proud American, but we have to be honest with ourselves. If you want to look at the war in the Pacific then you can tout America's overwhelming contribution to the defeat of the Japanese all you want, but the defeat of Nazi Germany lies mainly at the feet of Russia. \n\nI appreciate you sharing your perspective.

You'd wander onto their land which is riddled with unmarked anti-zombie traps because these people legitimately think they're the last people on earth, and if there are any other people it's an anarchist post-apocalyptic landscape so fuck em, you can't trust them.  So there's all sorts of tiger traps and shit and these guys (or small communities) might just shoot you out of distrust of you or even because they hate you for leaving them behind.\n\nThere's a number of senseless deaths mentioned in the books, one of the most memorable is the soldier guy who had like 3 or 4 stories, he talked about this girl he was close to when they were walking across America to take it back.

{"body":"I'd say that may be a symptom of the era like you mentioned.\n\nMy friends BiL found out he had a kid when the kid was 1.5. He had a one night stand with a girl and didn't hear from her again until she demanded child support.\n\nShe is a meth head, has no job and the courts gave her full custody. He could only see the kid with full supervision and had to pay $500+/mo in child support, plus back child support since he hadn't paid for the first 1.5 years (you know, the time period when he didn't know he had a kid).\n\nAnyhow, $40k in court and attorney fees and 2 years later, he got custody. The mom legit missed 8 court dates (just never bothered to show up or anything) during that time and they just rescheduled them for her, nbd. Since he got custody (4 years now), I think the mom has made it to 10 of her monthly visits (that's literally 1/6). She never called or anything, just never showed up to see her kid, yet it took $40k and a couple years for the court to figure out she was a shitty parent.\n\nI know this is just one case, and I don't know if it would happen this way in other states or what, but it was still fucked up. I also don't know what sort of tales/sob stories she told the courts. I'm assuming she told them the father neglected and abandoned them or some shit.\n\nIdk, custody battles scare me and make me hope (even more than I already do) that my marriage stays happy and lasts.

When he wasn't busy belittling his bar staff (and let's face it, bar staff at a stadium aren't exactly pick of the crop as a general rule but hey, we all need an income), he was just itching, possibly physically, to find some customer he could fuck up the day of by telling them that they looked drunk and could only buy one drink at a time instead of four.

In your case, I agree with your position that your mom should've sought help, a family therapist maybe, and learned how to tell your dad in a safe, controlled environment and receive guidance through the healing process, how to handle it with children, family, etc. So I understand where you're coming from with this stuff. \n\nBut in OP's case, although I agree that she should seek therapy if she feels she needs it, I don't think she should have to consider the \"more harm than good\" option. That's basically telling her that *potentially*, it may do more harm than good to tell her mom. I know you're not saying flat out that she shouldn't, but you're saying it's potentially the better option if it would fuck up everyone else's lives. \n\nConsidering this is a child molestation scenario, it's extremely difficult, and in many people's opinions, flat out wrong, to believe that keeping it to herself for the sake of others should even be an option she should have to weigh. Because it's a much more deplorable act than adultery. And that's why I think you're getting down voted. \n\nEdit: In other words, it's not a popular opinion that child abuse victims should think about silencing themselves for the sake of others. Cheating mom/wife though? That's understandable, as the victim is a fellow adult.","score":"15","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"Imagine you were the President of Venezuela in this situation.\n\nYour country is entirely leveraged on oil, and its economy crumbling because of the collapse of the oil price. You have a history of coup d'etat and violent otherthrow of governments in their moments of weakness. Inflation is running rampant, there are shortages of almost every commodity people need, and the pressures on social cohesion are starting to push people toward desperation and violence.\n\nIt's not a stretch to say you as President are in a very real danger of social upheaval and economic collapse. So how do you govern under such circumstances?\n\nYou are powerless to deal with the price of oil. You might invite in the IMF, but in doing so it would result immediately in the social collapse you fear and an explosion in violence. It might create a coup in itself.\n\nMore importantly, inviting the IMF or in any other manner 'liberalising' the market would simply mean vulture investors swooping in to pick up all your assets at fire sale prices. Later, the prices for goods and services will increase, as historic trend in privatisation, which will only hurt your people more. Likewise, all of the profits generated by the sale and the enterprises themselves will be expatriated out of the economy as profits for their foreign owners.\n\nIn place of that approach, the other move is to try to exert more control over everything in the hope to contain anger of the people and limit the damage panic might cause. This is the approach your predecessors have traditionally taken. \n\nIt's had some degree of success, though not without criticism. And of course some situations it is impossible to forestall the inevitable end. There's only so much control a government can exert on market forces.\n\nI don't think there is anything really that can reverse this turn of fortune for Venezuela, short of a rebound in oil prices. Of course other actors like SA have staked their entire futures and existence on winning this current price war, and even as partners, are determined not produce less and lose marketshare. If Venezuela had more diversity, or some other commodity it could push instead of oil it might be able to pivot. But in the absence of something immediate, the choices are quite grim. \n\nPeople should be asking themselves if they would prefer to see a civil war, mass-violence and rioting, and/or a military junta and the suspension of all forms of civil law. Because you, as President of Venezuela, run an administration that is the only thing standing in the way of it.","score":"40","subreddit":"Economics"}

I loved the overall tone/atmosphere of the episode, very mundane but somehow a bit eerie like anything could happen.\n\nI really like the premise already, at least what I understand of it. Aside from having a very neat character design, I like how the existence of this Little Slugger character is kept kind of ambigious to the point where you don't quite know if he's real or not. The scene where the rumors spread and his appearance started manifesting was great, and the ending left me unsure on what to think.\n\nAnother interesting scene was when Saki(?), the character artist, has a conversation with Mamori(?), further questioning whether she can be trusted or not.

This section that the show highlighted is roughly where one might find the [Temporal Lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe), the section of the brain that is associated with processing auditory and visual information, language recognition and perhaps some involvement with the development of long-term memory.\n\nAdditionally mentioned in this scene is the \"secretion of pleasure hormones\". The commonly known pleasure ~~hormones~~ neurotransmitters are [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin). Some [dopamine pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic_pathways) start in the [ventral tegmental area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral_tegmental_area) ([image](http://karg.cbi.pku.edu.cn/brain-info/vta2.jpg)) which is also where the Phantom World brain anatomy highlights in red.\n\n**Singing as a means to harmonise humanity**\n\nI am certain there is some research that highlights the benefits of singing in the way that the show describes. Of note, tying words to a melody can make it easier to remember (see things like [mnemonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) and the recital of things like sonnets with consistent meter). This is in part because activating different neural networks simultaneously can strengthen long-term memory formation.

I shouldn't have to do anything extra in order appease the regressive leftists who ironically call me a bigot for supporting liberal values.\n\nDon't be too quick to scorn caution here. There is a reason to have some kind of taboo against racism, and extra layers of caution when it comes to things that even suggest racism. (Note that I'm not talking about a legal restriction or anything like that.) Human beings have an evolutionary history that gives us built-in xenophobic instincts. These instincts are incredibly dangerous—to begin with, they are probably the most efficient large-scale means of dissolving the social-animal programming that usually prevents us from willfully harming one another. To make this topical, I'd point out that many religions are obsessive about us-they distinctions, and have ritualized hatred of the outsider at their core. Religions exploit our neurological wiring in many ways, and racism is one such way.\n\nExample: The sexual assaults by immigrants against German women. This is something that absolutely needs to be discussed, investigated, and dealt with. But you should go into that conversation fully aware that \"brown outsiders raping our white women\" is an image with truly primal origins, that lights up all those nasty primitive parts of our neural networks. We need to be conscious about that. It would be grossly irresponsible to simply \"wing it\" and rely on one's noble spirit to ward off racist thinking.\n\nI agree with you in that I disdain \"SJWs\" who try to apply absolutist, binary rules to the discussion of race. But I also think that any human being who says, \"I'm not racist, so I'm not going to be apologetic about it; if I think that too many blacks these days are violent, I'll speak my mind.\" is ignoring their evolutionary legacy with potentially dangerous consequences. And I think every responsible human should periodically engage in some meta-cognition, asking themselves, whether a particular attitude is being subconsciously influenced by race.","score":"29","subreddit":"atheism"}

Rape victims will always be given the benefit of the doubt, even those who are lying, because if there is the remote possibility that their claim is true, no one wants to further traumatize them. \n\nRape is kind of one of those crimes where it's the exception to the rule of \"innocent until proven guilty.\" Right or wrong, it's generally assumed that the alleged victim is telling the truth and the accused is guilty. Why? Because rape is not uncommon. But, also, no one wants to believe that someone would lie about something so heinous. \n\nIt happens though, and it's unfortunate that someone can be falsely accused, have their name dragged through the mud, go to trial and possibly end up in jail for something they really didn't do. But, that's the way this works in society, unfortunately. \n\nAnd unlike other crimes -- and maybe I'm wrong here -- but I believe rape has a lower threshold for the alleged victim. A claim plus dna may be the only things needed to bring charges. He said/she said is terrible too. It's possible for a couple to have sex then the woman to have regrets the morning after and say she was raped. So, how does the man defend himself? He admits to/is proven to have been with her. He admits to sex but says it was consensual, she denies it. Who do you believe? It's tough.\n\nNow, I think that we can agree there are far more real rapes than false accusations. But, false accusations are not insignificant. Someone's life is getting ruined because of a crazy person or someone with regrets or out for revenge.

{"body":"Those are not mutually exclusive. Women who accidentally get pregnant tend to stop drinking when they test positive if they plan to continue the pregnancy. And what woman who wouldn't stop drinking during an actual pregnancy is going to stop drinking for a hypothetical one?\n\nThe reality is that women who aren't trying don't generally find out THAT much later than women who are. Women not finding out in their first trimester is rare, despite TV shows dedicated to it. If you wait, say, a week after a missed period to take a pregnancy test, you're maybe two weeks behind a woman who tested before she missed her period. \n\nMost women who are actively trying to conceive will still drink during the \"two week wait\" between ovulation and their expected period. This is considered a personal choice, and not a health issue, because it's so low risk. Many women try for years and don't want to spend their lives in limbo on the off chance that this is the month. Is the CDC releasing new evidence of the danger of alcohol in early pregnancy, or are they just sounding alarm bells over something (drinking as you normally would until you have a positive pregnancy test result) that is very common and not seen as a significant danger?\n\nWith that in mind, is it really unimaginable that women are irritated by this? It might seem reasonable to you, but for a lot of us, it's like we're being told that, regardless of our own plans and what we've discussed with our own doctors, we should consider the health of children who *haven't even been conceived yet* before living our own lives. This isn't happening in a vacuum. This is happening in the context of ever-increasing restrictions on abortion, of debates over personhood laws and conscious clauses, and of business trying to get out covering the contraception we're apparently supposed to be using if we want to be able to drink. Women are already living with the message that we are mothers first and people second, and that an occupied uterus is a government interest instead of a personal matter. Now they're telling us that our empty uteruses are, too, because they might potentially become occupied in the future. It's a heavy-handed and paternalistic approach, and a suggestion that is about as helpful as abstinence-only sex education.","score":"-3","subreddit":"news"}

It was like a different satisfaction for me. \n\nPretty soon days turned into months and then by the time we were ~6 months in, I had no idea how to tell him. So I just kept faking it. \n\nI, too, told him during an argument. In frustration it kind of just came out. It was like I needed to be mad at him to admit something I knew would hurt him. \n\nWhile he was visibly hurt and trust was lost, he handled it extremely well. He didn't hold it against me. He got passed his ego and then made it his mission to make me cum. The very next time we had sex he asked me what I did to masturbate and then he tried to recreate it. It took a WHILE but he was so patient and happy to please me that it wasn't as hard as I was always worried it would be. Afterwards he was mostly just annoyed that I didn't tell him sooner because he could have been doing that all along. \n\nSo OP, please try your hardest to not be angry with her.

I was so happy not to hear any utterance of \"chimichanga\" throughout the film.\n\nThis is definitely more of a Joe Kelly Deadpool than a Daniel Way Memepool. You had the jokes coming at you every which way, but when the jokes stopped, it really had a nice romance plot with enough drama to give the whole thing some weight. That sex montage, though... Loved it. \"Happy Woman's Day.\"\n\nReally loved Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, too. They really made the film feel like it belongs to a larger world. Just moments like Colossus watching the news while eating cereal, and recognizing the chaos that was being reported on was all Deadpool made me grin.\n\nThe 4th wall breaking didn't feel as forced as I feared it might be. The \"McAvoy or Stewart?\" line might be my favourite line of the whole movie.\n\nMy whole theater was laughing all the way through. I was the only one who laughed at the appearance of Bob, though... It was cool to see Bob.\n\nThis is the Deadpool movie I wanted. So happy with it.","score":"228","subreddit":"movies"}

Of Birdman, Whiplash, Grand Budapest, Imitation Game, Boyhood, Selma, Theory of Everything, and American Sniper, I think only the latter two did not deserve to be on that list (but I thought the rest were all good enough to 'win', but I had my favorite). This was also the same years as Nightcrawler and Gone Girl, which I *also* would have been happy with. \n\nRegarding The Martian, it's a great movie, and it's straightforward and reserved. Watney doesn't break down, nor does the crew or NASA. What I LOVED about The Martian was how each character came into work and did their job to the best of their abilities. They had different ways of coping with impossible challenges (Watney's humor, Gambino's caffeine induced brain blasts, Daniel's 'whatever it takes' attitude, ect.) but they work together, and they get it done. It's a celebration of human cooperation, and it's a damned good one. You'd be correct in saying no character really has an 'arc', and while that's a criticism I'd throw at a lot of films, I think The Martian is an example of one where there shouldn't have been one.

At that point the dynamic range for digital was pretty abysmal, and the resolution was lacking. 35mm scans can be far larger than 3mp and can be larger than 18mp. Professional 35mm digital sensors are much better today and have greater dynamic range and resolution than film. However, to say that in 2002, discredits this guy.\n\nAlso he used a pretty low quality scan for the first image comparison. He did mention that he used a drum scan later however the resolution and quality of that one is pretty lacking. My university has the $20,000 Hasseblad flextight scanners. The images that I get scanning both medium format and 35mm film are far superior to the ones that I get on my Sony A7. It scans at 8000 DPI. Of course at that point, you are scanning grain.

There's a self awareness to his act, and the show which the Top Gear bit comes from culminates in a fabricated meltdown in which Lee runs through the entire theatre ranting and raving over a perceived slight from the Magners pear cider slogan.\n\nIf anything, Lee is more an absurdist comedian with social commentary thrown in. So many of his bits essentially involve him taking a premise or an argument and the pushing it to breaking point in order to highlight its inherent ludicrousness.\n\nWith the Top Gear bit, the brilliance is how self fulfilling the actual joke is. So many people in the comments section, who clearly weren't offended when Clarkson used racial slurs or joked about Mexicans, were suddenly livid when Lee made offensive jokes about Clarkson and Hammond, a lot of them not understanding that the joke wasn't so much about Top Gear itself, but about the double standard that ensues when people are just allowed to say awful things to each other, but fall back on the defence that it's okay! It's just a joke!\n\nHe's only really edgy if you consider the fact that many of the people he seems to offend tend to hate the fact that he's an unapologetic left wing liberal.

Yes, I agree but the ethnic tension is not because of the regular folks, they try to work hard, improve their lives just like everyone else, but rather by the imposed war spoils of Croatia and Serbia called the Dayton peace agreement.\n\nWhat it does is it imposes a false democracy, you see in the forced constitution the only important thing are so called constitutional people who are Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nIt means that no matter what the people's will is, no matter how many votes you get, you will get elected if you're one of the constitutional peoples.\n\nWhy is that false democracy?\n\nWell, take a look at the demography of Bosnia. There are roughly 1.8-1.9 million Bosniaks, 1.0-1.1 million Serbs and around 0.45-0.50 million Croats which no matter how many votes each group gets they get the same representation in politics.\n\nSo Croats for example are almost 4 times less in numbers than Bosniaks and they both get same representation, which basically means 1.5 million of Bosniak votes does not mean shit.\n\nNow take a look at the demography of Montenegro,\n\nMontenegro people 280k,  Serbs 180k, Bosniaks 60-70k... You roughly get the same proportion as in Bosnia.\n\nWhy aren't there harsh ethnic tensions in Montenegro? Why are they moving fast in their political goals compared to Bosnia?\n\nBecause they haven't got a crippling constitution imposed by their neighbors. Their country doesn't look at your ethnic origin, they value citizenship no matter what your origin is. The minority doesn't rule in Montenegro.\n\nWhere would Croatia be if Serbs in Croatia has equal representation as Croats?

Part of the debt jump was a correction, because Greece had forged the numbers for some time.\n\n\u0026gt;The figure for Greek government debt at the end of 2009 was also increased from its first November estimate at €269.3 billion (113% of GDP)[67][68] to a revised €299.7 billion (130% of GDP). The need for a major and sudden upward revision of both the deficit and debt level for 2009, only being realized at a very late point, arose due to Greek authorities previously having published flawed estimates and statistics in 2009. To sort out all Greek statistical issues once and for all, Eurostat then decided to perform their own in depth Financial Audit of the fiscal years 2006–09. After having conducted the financial audit, Eurostat noted in November 2010 that all \"methodological issues\" now had been fixed, and that the new revised figures for 2006–2009 finally were considered to be reliable.[69][70][71]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis#Debt_levels_revealed_.282010.29\n\nWhile there was a bank recapitalization, it wasn't nearly as huge as you allege it to be.\n\n\u0026gt;The Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) managed to complete a €48.2bn bank recapitalization in June 2013, of which the first €24.4bn were injected into the four biggest Greek banks. Initially, this €48.2bn bank recapitalization was accounted for as an equally sized debt-increase, which – when assessed as an isolated factor – had elevated the debt-to-GDP ratio by 24.8 points by the end of 2012. However, in return for this, the Greek government at the same time received a number of shares in those banks being recapitalized, which it can now sell again during the upcoming years (a sale that per March 2012 was expected to generate €16bn of extra \"privatization income\" for the Greek government, to be realized during 2013–2020).\n\n\u0026gt;According to the third quarter 2014 financial report of HFSF, the fund is estimated to recover a total of €27.3bn out of the initially injected €48.2bn to the fund. This estimated recovery of €27.3bn includes \"A €0.6bn positive cash balance stemming from its previous selling of warrants (selling of recapitalization shares) and liquidation of assets, €2.8bn estimated to be recovered from liquidation of assets held by its \"bad asset bank\", €10.9bn of EFSF bonds still held as capital reserve, and €13bn from its future sale of recapitalization shares in the four systemic banks.\" The last of these figures is affected by the highest amount of uncertainty, as it directly reflects the current market price of the remaining shares held in the four systemic banks (66.4% in Alpha, 35.4% in Eurobank, 57.2% in NBG, 66.9% in Piraeus), which for HFSF had a combined market value of €22.6bn by the end of 2013 – but only was worth €13bn on 10 December 2014.[125]\n\n\u0026gt;Once HFSF has liquidated all its assets, the total amount of recovered capital will be returned to the Greek government to help to reduce its debt. In early December 2014, the Bank of Greece allowed HFSF to repay the first €9.3bn out of its €11.3bn reserve to the Greek government.[126] A few months later, the remaining part of HFSF reserves were likewise approved for repayment to ECB, resulting in a total of €11.4bn debt notes being repaid during the course of the first quarter of 2015.[127]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis#Impact_of_the_conducted_bank_recapitalization\n","score":"15","subreddit":"europe"}

The result of this is a labour market that's out of balance, with too high wages and higher unemployment.\n\nThe reason for the somewhat marginal change in Central Bank interest rate is that the institution has recently had to stop taking into account the private loans effects on the housing market, which is technically not within the scope of their mission. So now they are back to focusing on their main task; managing the exchange rate.\n\nSo while the monetary policy is infact \"expansive\", it has nothing to do with government spending, and is infact a way to get the now unbalanced monetary market back into the state that it *should* be in.\n\nFurthermore it is important to note that the Central Bank is independent, and not subject to government directives.","score":"14","subreddit":"europe"}

I think the life of William Jennings Bryan marks the transition best. When he was born, slavery still existed in the US and there was still a giant open frontier; by the time he died, my great-grandmother (who lived to age 99) was already a teenager, commercial radio stations were flourishing, the automobile had become a major commodity, there was no more \"frontier\", and a lot of still-modern political and social debates had arisen. Shortly after, my still-living grandparents were born, and they all saw the great depression, second world war, dawn of the nuclear age, etc.\n\nIt's very weird to reflect on\n\nEdit: it's also worth mentioning that all of the structures I've lived in since graduating college were built during William Jennings Bryan's lifetime (oldest in 1876, newest around 1915ish).

Several laws were passed by emperors in the fourth and fifth centuries to stop the practice of pagan sacrifices and other forms of worship until paganism was completely outlawed in 392 by Theodosius I.\n\nIt wasn't about creating a universal religion at all, it was more the fact that the emperor was a Christian and so everybody else had to be Christian too.\n\nEdit: Furthermore they did not 'take Christianity and add in bits and pieces of pagan culture': Theodosius I didn't just flip a switch and all of a sudden 1000 years of traditions and culture disappeared.

He's from my home town, and I've always been suprised how many people across leftist communities on reddit have heard his music, love his music, and follow his career. So I wasn't sure if anyone here had heard this yet and I thought it would be a good time to post. \n\nHere is his facebook post announcing his retirement from music:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/patthebunnymusic/posts/656408277832146\n\nAnd a thread on /r/folkpunk about it:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FolkPunk/comments/440sgp/pat_the_bunny_on_no_longer_being_a_punk_or_an/\n\nHe wrote a lot of songs about topics we all care about; economics, politics, feminism, drug addiction, travelling, homelessness, and other things. He's a damn good musician who's definitely gone through a lot to deliver these songs. If you have a facebook account, consider dropping by and leaving him some love. He's said that all his merch and music is still available for purchase, and anything you buy is going to be forwarded to some activist groups or charities that he likes. As always, all his music is still freely available to download if you don't want to buy it. \n\nAnd that's about it ya'll. Sad day for me, his music has gotten me through a lot of shit in life so I'm sad to hear he's gone. But I'm happy to hear that personally he seems to be doing better than he ever has. So again, drop by and leave him some love if you appreciate his music.

{"body":"Coyotes are a notoriously destructive group of animals whose populations have exploded in the past century with increased urbanization. They are the bane of the modern sheepherder, being able to kill dozens of animals in a single night. Their presence in cities has resulted in 150+ human attacks, and some fatalities, since their expansion. Hunting these animals is neither cruel nor damaging to their populations, in fact several studies have shown that you would need to maintain a 75% coyote removal in an area for 10 years to actually control their population. Coyotes are density dependent animals, thus their litter size and recruitment can vary greatly from year to year depending on the number of coyotes in a given area, as well as sufficient access to food.\n\nI work as a nuisance trapper and am often called to respond to aggressive coyotes in the city, and removal of these animals is 100% lethal 100% of the time.

{"body":"It is a lot harder to kill someone with a knife than a gun, and generally, unless the wielder of the knife is skilled, it takes a lot of stabs, but only takes one bullet.\n\nIn order to kill someone with a knife quickly enough that they couldn't be saved, you need to do one of the following\n\n* Pierce the heart - This is difficult to do with a knife because the ribs block the heart. It's possible to stab laterally through the ribs, but this is difficult to do when untrained, and even more difficult with a struggling victim. You can break the ribs and pierce the heart, but it's unlikely an 11 year old would have the upper body strength and children have flexible ribs, so it would absorb much of the impact making a single kill stab unlikely.\n\n* Cut the jugular or cartoid - This is a difficult thing to hit from the front against a struggling victim. Because the girls sister was also there, it's likely her assistance would have rendered it difficult if not impossible to make a kill slice. Note: This is also a very survivable injury.\n\n* Cut the femoral vein or artery - This would also be a very difficult hit. It's likely kicking would occur by the victim if attempting to slice the inner leg. This is a difficult attack even for someone who is trained. \n\n* Pierce the soft palate in the mouth, up into the brain - This attack is also very difficult to make against a struggling victim.\n\nIn order to kill someone quickly enough with a knife that there is no hope of medical intervention, one of the above attacks occurred OR multiple stab wounds. This is an unlikely scenario given that according to TFA the victims mother was there fast enough to have her die in her mothers arms after a heart shot, so in a knife attack the mother would have likely stopped the attack before a fatal wound.\n\nHad this been a knife attack instead of a gun, the girls would likely not have accused the killers weapon of not being real, and probably would have run away screaming before he could get in kill range, and if they hadn't probably would have had defensive wounds and need of therapy, but not much more.\n\nI have no uncertainty that this death would not have occurred if the killer had not had access to the gun.\n\nNow, though I believe in strict gun ownership laws, I also don't believe this killing would have been prevented by them. I put some of the blame on the parents for not controlling access to the weapon and ammunition. It should not have been possible for the boy to gain access to the weapon and ammunition without one of his parents. Though TFA says, \"The boy had been trained in firearm safety and had hunted with his father and grandfather, the judge noted.\", it doesn't mean he was responsible enough to use it unsupervised, and this death proves that.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add this. Proof of my contention is the Slenderman girls stabbing, the victim survived.","score":"66","subreddit":"WTF"}

The government intervening in economic policy is not the problem. Its private businesses/corporations infiltrating our government to make laws that favor them.

Majority of the power in few hands.\n\nI believe the demand creates the supply. By sheer numbers average, middle class consumer's spending/purchasing power far outweighs the few that have untold wealth. The only way to get this economy to a state that we all want is for people to spend. Let's be honest we don't anymore. It's not because of your taxes being \"wasted\" on others.

The sane implementation would involve raising income taxes in such a way so that anyone earning enough (e.g. $30k) would have their mincome cheque negated/reduced; so in the end only a portion of the population would be getting and keeping their mincome cheque.\n\n~~-~~\n\n*\"This is just being supported by people who already make money and just want more.\"*\n\nThere probably are some people who haven't taken 2 seconds to think about the income tax compensation part, yes.\n\n~~-~~\n\n*\"People aren't going to have incentive to work if they have guaranteed income.\"*\n\nThe guaranteed income would be enough to help people afford food and shelter; not much in the way of luxuries ideally. Personally I'd still want a job so that I can make more money so I can afford luxuries (like a TV, computer, dining out, vacations, etc.). Also there's the potential for some people interested in entrepreneurial pursuits to focus on them rather than struggle to maintain a minimum wage job at the same time.

I have seen apologists apologize like crazy on this but the verse still says very plainly that until Earth passes away the OT still is in force. It reads to me like the fulfillment will happen some time after the apocalypse when both heaven and Earth are done. Since Heaven never will go away the verse seems to be saying that the OT will be in force forever even in heaven. Just simply reading this as English it seems very clear to me that Jesus is saying that we are all to follow the OT explicitly until heaven and Earth are finished which really means, forever.\n\nI doubt that Christianity would have ever taken off if Paul had not broken the OT off from Christianity.

{"body":"A little background:  I built this for Burning Man in 2013.  I started the project in 2011 because I was fascinated with the idea of technology being able to shift your perception in unusual ways.\n\nIn 2011 I picked a spot with a good view of some major landmarks and set up a tripod with three GoPro cameras recording a full 360 degrees.  Somehow I forgot to take any pictures of that part and the whole thing got stolen at the end of the week, but if you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahv_1IS7SiE) you can see the tripod at 3:20, just to the left of the standing girl.\n\nIt took several weeks of computer time to process the video, correcting the fisheye effect and stitching the videos together into one wide video.  One of the cameras had a lot of power problems and didn't get a lot of usable video, so I ended up using only two cameras and 240 degrees of arc.\n\nThe telescope is just a specialized video player.  It's built around a Raspberry Pi, which turned out to be a surprisingly capable little video player.  If I was to do this again I'd go with much higher resolution cameras and a more powerful player, but for a limited budget this worked out well.\n\nThe Pi just plays a wide-screen video, and data from the pan and tilt sensors in the telescope control the viewport, so that as you move the telescope around you're controlling what part of the video you're seeing and the effect is that you're looking around the video scene.\n\nThe telescope had to be placed on the same spot the camera array occupied, and it took a bit of calibration to get everything aligned, but once it was running you could look through the eyepiece at the Man and see the Man from two years before, then pan over to the temple and see 2011's temple.\n\nOverall it worked out pretty well.  It required some repairs during the week, but it's still in functional condition.\n\nEdit: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieelz7K5uIE\u0026amp;list=PLHz5xhOeun3k3H3IRkkf84Pz2dx4VYQVp) is the unprocessed video, sped up by about 300x normal.

{"body":"hello. \nI did it. and it was an experience to say the least. \nAs advised i tried half to see the effects in the 2liter bottle. I wasnt even sure if this stuff was DMT but i trust my dealer. \n\nI vaporized the DMT and it clouded up a little bit and i hesitantly took a hit. I took it all and held it all in, i started feeling the effects slowly. \n\nVision was blurring, blanket was moving as if i were on a shrooms trip. It actually tasted nice, nothing like i have ever tasted before. It felt like i was tasting \"gigabytes\" like i could taste some kind of energy in the smoke. I started feeling heavy and blew the smoke out after a good 12-15 secs after this point it starts feeling like a really intense shroom peaking , amazon mages and what not and right away i was like ok this is familiar i can do more.  I didnt think of closing my eyes which i think was the mistake. \n\nthen immediately i got up feeling all kinds of things and i managed to take the rest and put it in my da vinci sandwiched in some weed and i am sure i put less then i did in the bottle vape. I sat on my couch outside and started smoking , i put the temp to 221C all the way up. After a minute i started seeing very nice visuals of the buildings outside. then i closed my eyes all the while smoking and my breathing was heavy at this point, and now i understand what people mean.\n\nThis is when the it kicked in and i really experienced what DMT really is. \nI saw this wheel, and it was turning into a gear. and i was like wow. what. \ni was completely in this other dimensional plane. i could see a wave on top. i thought to my self this is the tunnel and if i wanted to i could go into it. but i restrained. \nThen i felt this thing, it was a [women](http://i.imgur.com/2wJ46tE.jpg) exactly like that, with the crossed legs and everything and i felt like it flicked me with its finger. and i freaked out,   and i kind of got out of the intense part after that, ) started feeling a little stomach ache so i went and laid down and instantly felt better. After that i was just coming out of it and trying to understand what happened. \n\nIm glad i tried it slowly and experimented a little, it was insane, i cant explain those 2-3 minutes or whatever it was. Next time im sure i can have a much nicer trip and experience it in all its glory. \n\nthanks for the help. \n\n(edit: i just want to mention that even though i felt freaked out because all this was very new, i felt like the entity was being playful and i immediately wanted to connect with it again, but i had this restraint and thought i have more and can experience this again properly the next time) \n\n(Edit: Also want to mention i felt like i could have gone much deeper, once i closed my eyes and experienced the \"loading screen\" i was scared and knew i have more so i backed out, but im amazed that with taking a minimal amount i was able to go this far in my first trip, next time i will not be scared.","score":"14","subreddit":"Drugs"}

{"body":"Let me start off by saying that i'm happy to see any form of harm reduction and anything that reduces the stigma around drugs. Because, let's face it: there's not nearly enough mainstream content out there. I think the best thing about his videos is that when your average Joe searches for a video about 'LSD', he gets easy to understand information and sees that there are normal, healthy people who do drugs.\n\nThat being said, i think there is a lot of improvement that can be made. I will list some of my critisism in random order:\n\n1) He says he wants to \"disspell the myths\" [1], but then he'll say shit like \"It's all energy, right? High energy, low energy...\". Some people might call this 'being in the drug phase'. Don't say shit like that if you want to legalise drugs in todays sociaty that is so dominated by science.\n\n2) Some of his videos have really low information per minute. For example his recent video about mescaline microdosing. He barely has anything of significance to report, yet the video lasts over 7 minutes. Come on man, you could have said all of that in half that time.\n\n3) As someone on the autism spectrum i was personally very disapointed with his 'LSD with autism' video. In this so called 'documentary', we are suposed to see how \"psychedelics would affect someone with an already different view of reality\" [3]. Yet from the moment the drug is taken, they barely even mention the autism. Look, if you don't know anything about it and/or don't want to talk about it, that's cool. But then don't mention it in the title or act like you are doing this crazy experiment. Now you're just using someone disease to get more views.\n\n\nThat's about it for now.

I could link your other arguments with me over there and the same thing would happen, so it's probably best to rethink your priors.\n\nBut yes, I clearly work for the IPA, it's not that this is more outright bullshit fearmongering from an advocacy group that has been caught lying on multiple occasions.  I'm just a shill.  That's too cute, really.  Especially since I was on your side until about two months ago.  You know what changed me?  The fact that I couldn't accurately recant points that those arguing with me would put forward.  Just like those disagreeing with me here can only disagree with me through downvotes, not through words.  It's sad that they haven't yet realised that it means they're on the wrong side, but it did take me a few months as well.  I'm sure they'll make it eventually.\n\nJust a heads up, in this text it doesn't change how we deal with infringements of fair use or copyright, all it does is standardise the punishments caused by breaking domestic laws.  If we choose to legislate heavily pro-consumer copyright and fair use clauses (with the exception of life+70, which was already standardised in the AUSFTA, possibly other minor areas that SJ might correct me on) then there is nothing anybody could do under the TPP.  Just as the US will continue with their current fair use and copyright under their domestic DMCA.\n\nAlso I'm not a free-market capitalist, although it's good to spin everybody you don't like or can't argue with into little boxes that you've created for easy dismissal.  I'm a Greens-voting economic rationalist with incredibly liberal social views and a penchant for academia supported taxation (e.g. Very high GST, think ~25%, no corporate taxes, low income taxes and a progressive CGT with a cap of 30% that encourages long-term investment.  Although some of these can be raised if revenue is lacking) highly redistributive fiscal policy (Very large NIT, other social programs if required) nationalisation of utilities and infrastructure, in addition to clever regulations in areas with a pressing social concern that won't be met with the most efficient application of resources (e.g. banking and housing).

Health services from memory also did a business case for Fibre to hospitals and health centres around Australia found that adding a high speed fibre network would cost $30billion at the time and save them money each year in transport and logistics costs.

Using current Pell Grant data doesn't make sense since it's looking at students still in school or who just graduated. The money Stanford/USC raise now comes from those who graduated 20+ years ago. Show me Pell Grant data from 20+ years ago and I'll concede that point to you.\n\n2. Can you show me the data for your second point about OOS and International students admits being equal to California admits? I don't think this is correct. \nAlso, just because a kid comes from a family that can afford to pay 60k a year doesn't mean they have the means to be big time donors. You confuse the 1% with the .001%. We have a lot of the 1%ers... we need more of the .001%ers. \n\n3. I agree that students at Cal are, on average, better off economically than those at the other UCs.\n\n4. Cal isn't a martyr so much as it is a victim of the UC system. We cannot raise tuition (the campus was counting on this to close it's deficit) without the permission of the Regents. Most of our endowment is managed by the Regent's and not the campus foundation (The campus endowment management company has done a better job of investing it's money). Much of what we do has to be approved by the UCOP. We do send our students off to good jobs. However, 100 people making $500,000 a year won't donate as much as 1 person making $50,000,000 a year (This is the difference between us and Stanford, we have a lot of students making good money, they have less students, but they go on to make HUGE money) Looking at Cal students and their participation in the Peace Corps and at how many students we have that go on to work in the non-profit sector would make me believe Cal students aren't selfish.\n\nI think Cal is on the right track. Things like the Berkeley Founder's Pledge show we're making an effort to connect with our successful alumni. This is something Stanford and USC have done for decades that we're just starting to do. In 20 years we'll be able to compete with our private peers, we just need to continue to build up our philanthropic outreach.","score":"22","subreddit":"berkeley"}
{"body":"I think going the straight witches route was kind of boring. There's an edit you could do of this film where you remove the blatantly supernatural elements and make it about a family torn apart by fear and superstition, and frankly I think I would have been a lot more frightened by that film.\n\nAlso, as far as the social narrative of witches goes, this film felt really muddled. The final scene plays like a moment of empowerment. The concept of witches as \"just women with agency\" (as Dan Harmon once put it) is certainly an interesting one, and a puritanical society would be a good setting for such a take, but when the witches have crossed the line into baby murdering, they kind of lose any moral high ground that would earn the film the right to treat the final scene as being about empowerment. Besides, ultimately the story is about Satan gas lighting a young girl into being a witch by tearing apart her family. Not exactly an empowering narrative.

There's the Nox and the Tollan, who at first wouldn't even give Earth the time of day. Even the alliances that did work out, the Tok'ra and the Jaffa, had dissolved during a major war with Anubis.

{"body":"There are a couple of problems with the way that Hawkeye is presented that leads to dissatisfaction with the system. \n\n1) It's shown on TV as a perfect representation of where the ball goes.  After the ball has hit the pad, this isn't really accurate. Hawkeye can track the exact position of the ball prior to it making contact with the batsman, but after that it's based on probability. The more variables involved, the larger the margin of error. To demonstrate this more intuitively to a TV audience, the Hawkeye graphic should be as is until the ball hits the batsman, and then should be a tunnel, increasing in diameter as it travels. When this graphic reaches the stumps, it would be possible to show it as a circle, overlapping the stumps. For one that was plumb (a guy gets hit on the back foot from a full toss), the circle would be small, and probably all of it would be on the stumps. Because there are fewer variables (the ball wouldn't deviate off the ground, and there's not much distance to travel), Hawkeye could be very certain the ball was going to hit. If a guy charges down the pitch to the spinner, and gets hit, the Hawkeye circle would be much larger (the ball would deviate off the ground, there's far more distance to travel), and therefore would be much larger than the previous example. More than 50% of this circle would need to be on the stumps in order to overturn the onfield decision. This is how Hawkeye works, but isn't how it's graphically represented. When you watch Hawkeye, it's natural to think that the ball-tracker is saying exactly where the ball is going. It's not really, it's just the centre of the circle I described above. \n\n2) The role of the Third Umpire isn't really made clear. The Third Umpire's job effectively is like a judge in an appeals court: it's his job to see if he should overturn the on-field umpire's decision. He's not checking the decision *per se*, but seeing if the on-field ump has overlooked a key piece of evidence. In rugby, the referee asks the TMO 'Is there any reason why I can't award the try?'. This is clearer wording, and makes it obvious that the TMO is there to look for the howler. Ultimately, that's why reviews were introduced to cricket: to stop the horrendous decisions. So, in the example you gave above, the technology doesn't provide any reason why the umpire's decision should be overturned (meaning there's no clear evidence either way, so the original decision stands). \n\nIn reality, the technology that they've introduced has improved the game. It's not 100%, but it is far less likely to make a mistake than an on-field umpire. I think a lot of the problems of perception with DRS come down to how it is explained to the viewer. The commentators definitely don't help the matter. \n\nTL;DR: The umpire *thinks* the decision is out, and gives it; Hawkeye doesn't *know* that he's wrong, so doesn't correct him. Remove DRS and the decision would be the same. ","score":"16","subreddit":"Cricket"}

{"body":"Okay, so, bear in mind that I'm in the US in a different system and I did not personally see the patient. Also, not a trauma surgeon, I just learn alongside them in the ED. \n\nIn trauma, just remember your ABCs. You secured an airway for your patient, presumably he had decent breath sounds and didn't need emergent needle thoracostomy, and then you started fluid resuscitation. And you didn't stay on scene, you scooped and ran, which is appropriate for this guy. \n\nFrom the top, with anisocoria and GCS 3, that could be an uncal herniation from a traumatic ICH, which is typically a cause of death. However, with a secure airway (an ETT), we can continue to oxygenate/ventilate him essentially indefinitely. You're also describing a patient who is hypotensive and not tachycardic. Either this guy already herniated, or he's in neurogenic shock (or he's in hemorrhagic shock and took some beta blockers that morning). I can tell you IF he has a spinal cord injury, it'll be below C4 based on the fact that he's able to inspire/expire and that may also be the cause of that dilated pupil due to a transaction of his sympathetic nerve chain causing a Horner's syndrome. You're describing a depressed skull fracture and a mid face fracture, probably a skull base fracture (acutely look for epistaxis or hemotympanum, or clear CSF leaking from nose/ears). As a medic, there's not much to do for those fractures (and definitely don't try to nasally intubate or place an NG).\n\nThat patient also has bilateral rib fractures by your report and some combination of pneumothorax/hemothorax if he got bilateral thoracostomy tubes. Again, he's on a ventilator, his lungs will still expand, but he is set up to get a ventilator associated pneumonia or, more likely, acute respiratory distress syndrome. In patients over 60 who have rib fractures, each fracture produces a 10% risk of mortality.\n\nSo, what's next? Depends on how he responds to his interventions. If he's persistently hypotensive despite crystalloid, blood transfusion, and vasopressors, then he could be actively exsanguinating into a body cavity. If he arrests after blunt trauma, his odds of survival drop precipitously. He may need an emergent laparotomy or thoracotomy. If he has a traumatic brain bleed, depending on appearance, he may need emergent craniectomy. It depends on what other injuries he has that we can't see. We either need imaging with ultrasound or CT, or direct visualization in the OR. However, if he continues to decline, he may ultimately end up as an organ/tissue donor. He's gonna be looking at some time in an ICU regardless.\n\nI've seen numerous GCS3 patients who have made it out of the hospital, GCS alone isn't necessarily going to predict his outcome. A pt can have a GCS of 3 due to alcohol and have no other injuries from their MVC and then metabolize their alcohol and skip out of the hospital.  However, you're describing some very severe injuries. A pedestrian struck by a vehicle at 100km/HR is a very powerful mechanism of energy. I often tell our patients' families that it's hard to predict early on exactly what's going to happen. It's difficult to gauge exactly the outcome of a trauma patient, there are several scoring systems set up to predict such things, like TRISS. You can go here: http://www.trauma.org/archive/scores/index.html.  Some patients can have a very severe injury and recover fully, some may have seemingly minor injuries and die in the hospital; I have stopped trying to guess because I just get humbled anyway.\n\n\n\n","score":"42","subreddit":"medicine"}

{"body":"Lots of rabble-rabble about \"how is this related to mens rights?\", but it seems pretty clear to me.\n\nLegal and medical issues are definitely our top priority. Whether it's discrimination against hiring men, or keeping men from their children, or our reproductive rights, those are absolutely the things we should be focusing on first and foremost. Men are *dying*, four times more than women, due to inadequate support and treatment for suicidal depression. That's a serious problem.\n\nBut another problem we should be aware of, one which *contributes* to suicide in men, is the social biases for against men and for women. \n\nThis article is an example of those biases. It shines the light on an awful double-standard we honestly don't call out enough: Women that demand equal treatment from men, but refuse to give equal treatment to men.\n\nNearly half of women surveyed said they would end a potential relationship if they were expected to \"chip in\" at a restaurant. Let's rephrase that statement for those not grasping the gravity: Nearly half of women surveyed said they dislike men that believe in equality.\n\nThat's suddenly a bit more frightening, isn't it? Indeed, it stirs up memories of the study that said [women perceive the absence of benevolence as hostility](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/6958/Yeung_Amy.pdf;jsessionid=FB488C1B98BC7A23439F156E7F99D5C1?sequence=1).\n\nI think we're all well familiar with the feminist extremists that advocate for the special treatment of women, but reports like this reveal the more widespread and sinister issue that indeed *most* women seem to believe they're entitled to special treatment.\n\nIt's easy to be jaded and go \"Bwah, let the bitches have their wine, cats, and loneliness\", but this affects men too. If nearly half of women aren't willing to comply with the basic sentiments of equality, then where does that leave men seeking a partner?\n\nMGTOW, which I often feel like myself, is not something to be proud of. It's the symptom of a social disease. A culture where tensions and poor communication between the sexes has become so intense, that some people are just dropping out of the game entirely.\n\nIt's a problem we should be trying to solve for, not just scoff at as irrelevant or obvious.","score":"35","subreddit":"MensRights"}

Statistically speaking, adolescent males commit the most crimes, violent and otherwise. So, although I dont agree with it, I believe the logic is that by keeping out young men, they will reduce the crimes committed by refugees.\n\nThe \"vulnerability\" is how they describe it. They allow in gay men and men that are part of a family (ie a teenage boy coming with his parents is allowed, but alone is not). Maybe it's just a cover, I don't know. I just never got the \"vulnerability\" angle.\n\n\u0026gt;However, female rapists are not \"guaranteed to receive extremely lenient sentences\". In fact, many female rapists do see jail time and a lot of it.\n\nThey aren't guaranteed that now, no. But many feminists, particularly in countries like the UK and Scotland, are arguing for the removal of all woman's prisons and to instead use community sentences regardless of the crime. And they're meeting large amounts of success. This is the policy I was asking about.\n\nAnd while many rapes committed by woman may not be as bad, we're not really talking about 18 year olds having consensual sex with 15 year olds here. There are a lot of horrible sex crimes committed by women that, by and large, go unpunished thanks to feminist-inspired legal codes urging judges to avoid jailing women. I'll provide some examples of what I'm talking about. [Krystal Harvey](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1\u0026amp;objectid=11579355) recorded a video of herself raping her 1 year old son and sold it online to buy herself a laptop - despite facing 20 years in prison, she received home detention. [Jade Hatt](http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Babysitter-Jade-Hatt-sex-boy-11-listed-honest/story-28212827-detail/story.html), a 21 year old babysitter who raped the 11 year old she was watching, avoided any jail sentence despite the boy saying he didn't enjoy it and asking her to stop. [Barbara Kirby](http://bossip.com/1093657/pedo-pervs-woman-accused-of-drugging-raping-teen-boys-telling-them-age-is-just-a-number/), 36, drugged 12 and 13 year old boys to knock them out before raping them. There are tons and tons of these stories, and the vast majority of these women never spend a day in jail.\n\nSometimes it's because of double standards in not believing that boys can be sexually assaulted by women, and that's not something I blame feminists for. But more and more frequently the judge will acknowledge the harm on the victim but then still allow the woman to walk free because of their instructions to avoid sending women to jail at all costs - and this is something that feminists are responsible for. So my question here is, how can you support legislation like this that gives community sentence as a punishment for heinous cases of rape and abuse?\n\nEdit: Thanks for replying by the way!","score":"20","subreddit":"MensRights"}

{"body":"I always think of this:\n\n\"This is the time of year when people would slaughter, back when people did that — Rollie and Eunice Hochstetter, I think, were the last in Lake Wobegon. They kept pigs, and they'd slaughter them in the fall when the weather got cold and the meat would keep. I went out to see them slaughter hogs once when I was a kid, along with my cousin and my uncle, who was going to help Rollie. Today, if you are going to slaughter an animal for meat, you send it in to the locker plant and pay to have the guys there do it. When you slaughter pigs, it takes away your appetite for pork for a while. Because the pigs let you know that they don't care for it. They don't care to be grabbed and dragged over to where the other pigs went and didn't come back. It was quite a thing for a kid to see. To see living flesh, and the living insides of another creature. I expected to be disgusted by it, but I wasn't — I was fascinated. I got as close as I could. \nAnd I remember that my cousin and I sort of got carried away in the excitement of it all and we went down to the pigpen and we started throwing little stones at pigs to watch them jump and squeal and run. And all of a sudden, I felt a big hand on my shoulder, and I was spun around, and my uncle's face was three inches away from mine. He said \"If I ever see you do that again I'll beat you 'til you can't stand up, you hear?\" And we heard. \nI knew at the time that his anger had to do with the slaughter that it was a ritual and it was done as a Ritual. It was done swiftly, and there was no foolishness. No joking around, very little conversation. People went about their jobs — men and women — knowing exactly what to do. And always with respect for the animals that would become our food. And our throwing stones at pigs violated this ceremony, and this ritual, which they went through. Rollie was the last one to slaughter his own hogs. One year he had an accident; the knife slipped, and an animal that was only wounded got loose and ran across the yard before it fell. He never kept pigs after that. He didn't feel he was worthy of it. \nIt's all gone. Children growing up in Lake Wobegon will never have a chance to see it. It was a powerful experience, life and death hung in the balance. A life in which people made do, made their own, lived off the land, lived between the ground and God. It's lost, not only to this world: but also to memory. \"\n— Garrison Keillor \n\"Hog Slaughter\"\n","score":"144","subreddit":"Documentaries"}

I know some amiibo go for like billions of dollars because of bad supply. If I waited like a month or two would it still be likely that I could get the Ganon amiibo for a reasonable price?","score":"-8","subreddit":"nintendo"}
{"body":"**Fire Emblem: Awakening**\n\nI am a big fan of the Fire Emblem series, and I eagerly anticipate Fates' release two weeks from now, but I do find Awakening rather overrated. Many of the mechanics from older installments are MIA and the map design is relatively devoid of terrain, meaningful side objectives and any victory conditions beyond the rather barbaric Kill Commander and Rout the Enemy. Worse, due to among other factors the non-linear gameplay, the new skills, and the new pair-up system, Awakening is a one of the series' low-point in terms of balance.\n\nTo be honest, Awakening feels like a major step back in difficulty and complexity in comparison to the last original game released prior Radiant Dawn. That being said, by no means is Awakening a bad game. The characters are charming, aesthetically it's the best Fire Emblem has ever looked, the music is epic and the voice cast is an extreme improvement over Path of Radiance's and Radiant Dawn's. However, when it comes down to the core gameplay, I feel Awakening omits far too many of the brilliant mechanics of prior installments in exchange for some rather poorly balanced new ones, and for this reason, I feel it is not \"The Best Fire Emblem Ever\" or \"The Ocarina of Time of the Fire Emblem series\" like many mainstream media publications claimed. Thankfully, it seems many of the underlying issues with Awakening's balance have been remedied in Fates.","score":"15","subreddit":"nintendo"}

But seeing as the rest of the EU had a lukewarm response when France invoked the Lissabon treaty, do the readers of this subreddit really think that the european nations can stand united against russian aggresion, when they can't even face a jihadist pseudo-state. We need only to look at the response to the Ukraine conflict which, while not a EU nor a NATO member which might impact the decisions made by EU leader, was not very decisive and varied widely. \n\nIf the US is to be expected to respond to russian agression, should not we, speaking as a european, be prepared to do the same? Looking at the present military budgets of EU members, excepting those bordering Belorussia and Russia, we hae not seen a significant rise in response to Russia. As such, it seems we are not prepared. Why then, should the US feel compelled to do the same?","score":"14","subreddit":"geopolitics"}

{"body":"Hello everyone!\n\nI know a lot of people have had issues with the third arc. About the writing being off and the art not holding up.\n\nHere's the thing I want people to know. What happened with the original artist wasn't just something I moved on from the next day. It was a brutal time for everyone involved. It had an effect. \n\nThe new arc is darker, maybe confusing. Because that's what my life has been like in regards to Rat Queens since Roc left. It was one huge derailment after another. I nearly gave up, but I knew fans wanted more. Some fans.\n\nI want to say this about Tess Fowler. She saved Rat Queens. When Stjepan had to quit after two issues due to health reasons, I was done. But Tess came on, encouraged me to continue, and took over the series with ZERO practice time. She literally started drawing a monthly comic series having never drawn the characters in more than a pinup and not only that, but full time, never having done a monthly series.\n\nShe's done a stellar job just getting these issues out. But people aren't seeing that. They are seeing that Rat Queens looks different.\n\nI'm working out my demons in this arc. It's not called \"Demons\" for nothing. \n\nOur next arc is a brand new start. Tess will have time to do some designs, get familiar with the world without the looming deadlines. (We have a small break between arcs).\n\nIt's going to be fun again. It's going to feel like the original volume. But it WILL be different. Because Rat Queens has changed with everything that's happened. \n\nBut I still love these characters. And I want to take them on insane adventures. Hope you come along.\n\nKurtis\n\nEdit: Side note. I've looked into overall numbers for many Image series. There has been a fall of around 2000 copies per issue for many titles. I'm speculating it is related to the tanking CDN $. Our best selling issue ever was the Braga one shot by Tess.","score":"123","subreddit":"comicbooks"}
