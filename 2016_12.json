I *WANT* to get Vega but AMD has now let Nvidia rule the high-end for a year by the time they finally release it.

IE, it made no sense to have R9 380 and R7 370, when the 370 alone indicates lower performance than the 380.\n\nInstead AMD is going to have two versions this generation. Radeon RX 400 series targets those who want to meaningfully play games. The Radeon 400 series (not out yet) will target ultra budget consumers and system integrators. The Radeon 400 series would be those looking for something basic, but better than their older or nonexistent integrated graphics.

Michael Bradley didn't show up in big moments like always (he played ok in comparison with the rest of the squad, but should've played better). Beitashour created a lot of chances that just didn't amount to anything. \n\nSo in reality, the match was just all Toronto offense and all Sounders defense. But what really counts? The scoreboard. and at the end of the day, the Sounders finished more chances than Toronto. \n\n","score":"54","subreddit":"MLS"}

It succeeds at being very potent lategame while still giving you a lot of toys to play with.\n\n[Level 35 build (use S.P.E.C.I.A.L book on strength)](http://www.gameplorer.de/fo4/#1-60330002-300033-1-5202-50330002-4030002--127)\n\n[Level 50 build](http://www.gameplorer.de/fo4/#1-60540003-300034-1-6203-50340004-4050003-1001-127) \n\n[Level 75 build](http://www.gameplorer.de/fo4/#1-80543503-300034-1-6234-50440044-4050033-1031-127 ) \n\nI play this build a ton and am currently level 75 on it, but I had the build planned out from the moment I started. From a min-max perspective, it isn't the most efficient, but I didn't make this character to be efficient. I made her to be needlessly violent and destructive. With that said, things eventually became a breeze with this build even on Very Hard and I had to install difficulty mods to make it a challenge again. \n\nStarting Stats - S:4, P:4, E:2, C:6, I:6, A:5, L:1. I always collect all the bobbleheads to maximize the perks I can get by allocating/upgrading a stat to be 1 below where I need it and then getting the bobblehead. If you do this, the only stats you will need to upgrade are strength for melee damage and steady aim and luck once for bloody mess. High charisma is entirely optional since the highest charisma perk I take is Lone Wanderer at 3 charisma. Role playing as a manipulative character is better with high charisma, though. \n\nIf you want higher melee damage at the start but still want to eventually have high charisma, set your starting stats to S:7, P:4, E:2, C:3, I:6, A:5, L:1. The strength bobblehead can be acquired somewhat quickly, so you can easily have 8 strength at the beginning of the game. Now, instead of upgrading strength at your leisure and luck once, you will upgrade Charisma at your leisure and luck once.\n\nIf you still choose to forego high charisma in order for your character to reach their power spike earlier, do the same S.P.E.C.I.A.L setup I just mentioned and simply never put any more points in charisma. It can be argued that this is the best gameplay option because you will have Chemist 4/4 and can use Grape Mentats to have +5 charisma for a while. Still, I wanted my character to be naturally manipulative, so I opted for high charisma.\n\n[Aesthetic](http://imgur.com/a/tswnN): Torn Shirt and Jeans with Disciples Metal Chest Piece, Operators Metal Arm, Disciples Metal Arm, and Disciples Left and Right Leg.\n\nMy Endgame Weapons:\n\n* Kiloton Radium Rifle - an absolute powerhouse that tears enemies to shreds in spectacular fashion. I do not use a modded barrel on it in order to keep the hip fire accuracy high, which I will talk about later.\n\n* Two Shot Combat Shotgun - Kiloton Rifle cannot be used in very close quarters because the explosions will kill you easily. This weapon has been a capable substitute for those sorts of situations. Mostly just for variety since my knife/ripper is better for close quarters combat.\n\n* Assassin's Handmade Rifle - Fully modded, this weapon has next to no recoil, making it a great tool for long range engagements. You will mostly fight humans, so Assassin is a great legendary effect. I *do not* use The Problem Solver or Splattercannon (Furious legendary effect rifle) because I consider them be severely overpowered. They increase damage by 22% for each consecutive shot, and I do not think there is a cap to how high the damage can go. This ensures that even enemies who are supposed to be difficult to kill will be no more difficult than a weak raider.\n\n* Plasma Infused Assault Rifle - Stronger against non-humans than my Handmade Rifle, but weaker against humans. I like this, because it encourages me to use different weapons for different situations. Also, it's great for mowing down weaker mobs with its 80 bullet modded clip. \n\n* Death From Above - Missile Launcher sold by BoS that increases movespeed by 75% when aiming. Mod it with a targeter, and you dance around foes while shooting homing missiles everywhere. It doesn't matter how fast you're moving when you don't need to aim. \n\n* Big Boy - Two Shot Fat Man sold by Arturo. If you plan to do what I detailed in the OP, you will be undergoing one of the bloodiest playthroughs of Fallout 4 possible. You're going to need some massive fire power, even if it is a little overkill. \n\n* Violent Minigun - High chance that you'll cripple someone with how many bullets this gun shoots per second. Not really necessary to have, just another fun weapon for me to play with and is good for roleplay. \n\n* Throatslicer - Wounding Disciples Blade bought in the market at Nuka World. \n\n* The Reckoning - Sentinel Ripper bought in Far Harbor. I know, its not a very good legendary effect, but I haven't found a legendary ripper at all. I refuse to use The Harvester because it's disgustingly overpowered (pretty much staggerlocks enemies) \n\nAs an evil character, I wanted to give myself the tools to cause as much carnage as possible. This means explosions, melee weapons, and tons of shell casings hitting the floor. One second I'm mowing people down with explosive bullets, and the next I'm carving someone up with a Ripper. I'd cripple my opponents and drop a grenade on them while they were unable to run away. I never used stealth; I wanted my enemies to know I was coming and feel as much pain and fear as possible. \n\nTwo more things I want to talk about:\n\n**Why Not Spray N Pray?:** Well they both will deal insane damage since you have 4 points in demolition expert (yes, explosive rounds are affected by it). However, I much prefer the Kiloton Radium Rifle since it's more balanced. An explosive legendary on a submachine gun is broken because of how fast it shoots and because of how many bullets a submachine gun holds per clip. When I was using Spray N Pray, every  enemy was a joke. Even unmodded, you can shoot 50 bullets without needing to reload. With the Kiloton Radium Rifle, I can keep it at 20 bullets a clip, so even though it deals ludicrous damage, the DPS will have a lot of downtime. Also, the explosive legendary doesn't care how much damage your shot does since the explosion will always deal the same damage no matter what gun it's on. It only cares about how fast you get those bullets out. The submachine gun shoots a lot of bullets very fast, meaning the explosive legendary effect procs more. The Kiloton Rifle has more DPS, but it shoots slower than the Submachine gun. This is good for balance because the explosive legendary effect, which does crazy damage with demolition expert 4/4, won't proc as much with it. Spray N Pray is like a godmode weapon: point in the enemy's general direction, hold down LMB, and watch everyone die while hardly ever having to reload.\n\n**Steady Aim 3/3:** Most people don't seem to get this perk, but I have an interesting way of making the best of it. The Radium Rifle has a great deal of recoil and isn't the easiest to use at longer distances. So, instead of modding it's barrel to be better for long ranges, I deliberately didn't put a better barrel on it so as not to sacrifice hip fire accuracy. This + steady aim 2/3 leads to great hip fire accuracy on the Kiloton Radium Rifle, and then when you get steady aim 3/3 it's like a free all-around damage boost. I mostly like this because I played a (kilo)ton of CS:GO, but this also opens up fun new ways to play the weapon. Use hipfire in close-mid range engagements and aim below the waist instead of the head. The explosive bullets will have a high chance of crippling your targets legs, steady aim 3/3 bonus damage will proc, and even if you miss, the explosions will still hit the ground near them and deal damage. Hip firing also seems to have far less recoil than aimed firing with Radium rifles. \n\nI'm obsessed with balance, so many of the choices I made when building this character or choosing weapons were to promote balance in some way. I also love variety; I want to avoid having a weapon that is undeniably the best in every situation. Keeping balance and variety in mind are what have kept me coming back to this character for 75 levels, and I'm still not bored. \n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask. I'm considering doing a more detailed post at r/Fallout4Builds if there's interest. \n\nEDIT: Fixed a lot of grammatical errors, sentence fragments, etc.                                      ","score":"15","subreddit":"fo4"}

Younger men can find it easier to restart soon after, hell as a teenager I could rest by going down then return to sex for a second, sometimes even not stop. To expect a man to continue after is asking him to have the luck of genetics or a stubborn personality essentially. That or it suggests you gave him a less than satisfying orgasm. The male orgasm is a checkered flag, anything after is showboating. There seems to be a lack of understanding here that it's not really a choice for most men, it's probably about the same as asking your lady for D.A.P.\n\n\nIf you still have the hormones racing through and you have the urge sure most girls don't say no to more fun, I've only had a few show no interest, but it's not the norm for men to be able to. Best proof of this is to look at subs around femdom and submission and how much difficulties come into getting men to eat their own semen, the urge for all things leaves at orgasm. \n\n\nEdit:- downvotes for stating that it's not men being selfish but it's science and that it's unreasonable to expect this behaviour because of the chemical and therefore physical reactions of the male orgasm?

{"body":"There is one universal lesson every musician needs to learn - and most do if they stick with it long enough: The most important thing is the song. Each instrument's part should only serve to ADD to a song, even if all you're adding is silence. \n\nSo where do you start when writing? Doesn't matter. It could be a sweet guitar riff, a vocal melody, a set of chord changes, or it could be a bass and drum groove. The starting point is irrelevant as long as it's inspiring, its where you go from there that really matters.  Every choice from there needs to be considered for what it brings to the song, how it makes it better. \n\nTake, for example, a sweet guitar riff you just wrote - the rest of the band really digs it.  Well, it's going to be a driving rock song so it'll need a good driving drum rhythm behind it. The drummer starts mucking around and you all agree on three grooves that work with the riff.  Which do you choose? \n\nDrummer doesn't like the first one because it's really simple and votes for one of the other two, he doesn't care which. Bass player speaks up that she likes the third one so you and the drummer fire up again. Soon enough the bass player has a tight groove with the drummer. \n\nBut something isn't sounding right. You're playing the same guitar riff, the drum groove is cool, and the bass and drums are locked in tight. And it just isn't exciting anymore. It doesn't live up to the potential you heard when you were first playing it on your own.\n\nYou suggest going back to that first simple beat. The drummer starts hitting and the bass player, in an attempt to exaggerate the simplicity of the beat, just starts playing eighth notes on the root. Well, you launch in to riff again despite their eye rolls. Low and behold, it's fucking awesome again! The riff suddenly has that power again that you were hearing when you first played it.  The bass line and drum groove, despite being simple, were the right ones for the song.\n\nAny musician that says something is too boring, simple, or beneath their skills has yet to learn that lesson I mentioned earlier.  They are generally harder to jam with and always harder to listen to. These are the guitar players using tons of distortion over a mellow song, the bass players that never play whole notes, and the drummers that play as if they're paid per hit. \n\nSo who's right - you or your brother? Neither, both. If he has a good chord progression or riff then build on that. If you've got a groove start there. But be vigilant; you serve the song and only the song. Feeding the ego leaves less to give the song. \n\n\n\n  ","score":"23","subreddit":"Bass"}

Also, because they weren't holding to their end of things, I figured anything like that would be invalid as I hadn't technically finished the job.

Hell, one of my [favorite games of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starflight), and a major influence on gaming (from Mass Effect to Dwarf Fortress) was developed by a team working in a garage having never developed a game before in their lives. This was in 1984.\n\nAnd it was funded by Electronic Arts. \n\nIn other words, you stop trying to be an indie developer in a very different market. Indie developers can only exist within the PC gaming space because PC gaming is so well established. Trying to drag that same 'business model' over in to an infant industry is destined to failure without adapting to the market.\n\nWhile selling off the soul of VR in its infancy is one way of 'adapting', I say it's unacceptable. There are alternatives. Take them, or don't develop for VR. Because selling out and developing hardware exclusives is a short-term game with long-term penalties.\n\nPC gaming became well established *not* by developing hardware-specific games (beyond actual hardware requirements like 3D acceleration and x86 processors) but by having deep pockets funding game development and slowly nurturing the available market penetration of the PC over time.

I wouldn't have called it a POS, but it's not great. They are MASSIVELY overhyped. I wouldn't own one again, and even though it was my first \"fun\" car and there's nostalgia in that, I do not recommend them to others. \n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nFoxbodies suffer from a VERY poor suspension design that is archaic at best. The rear control arms bind badly when turning, and the short upper control arms aren't great for putting power down. There's a reason the S197 was praised for handling improvements, and all they did was remove one upper link, straighten the lower arms, and add a panhard bar. Switching the front to a standard macpherson strut also helped a lot. The conventional springs in the foxbody have VERY poor ride quality considering the low wheel rates they produce. Foxbodies also had awful power steering systems that overheat constantly when pushed hard and the lack of caster (0.9 degrees) produces zero steering feedback. You have to drill and slot the shock towers to gain proper camber and caster.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nThe brakes are woefully underpowered as well. Undersized discs up front with non-sealed bearings. Gigantic single piston calipers made of iron up front, tiny drum discs in the rear. \n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nThe structure of the foxbodies (and to a lesser extent, the SN95s) leaves a LOT on the table. Properly welded in subframe connectors are a must. I put an IRS in my foxbody and actually creased the quarter panels because of the extra moment created on the rear frame. Having subframe connectors installed made the front of the car actually connect to the rear of the car when turning. It was shocking the difference they made. To add to that, the metal for the body is THIN. It's like 18-20 gauge everywhere except the actual frame rails, which are around 12 gauge. I didn't realize how thin it was until I had to drill a few holes. The thin paneling everywhere really showed in ride quality and noise. Honestly, I don't ever want to ride in another foxbody without a proper cage. The welds, quality of metal, thickness of metal, and fit/finish is terrifying. You have to square the front k-member based upon the position of the rear lower control arm mounts, what kind of precision is that?!\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nOh, and the lower control arm mounts crack and break if you launch it hard enough. All of them have this problem. Even the 4-cyl cars.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nThe engine could possibly be the one saving grace of the car, but it's still \"meh\" as far as engine design goes. It's very simple and easy to work on, but it produces jack shit in terms of horsepower when stock. It's got a shatload of torque, but that's mainly due to the head design and SUPER long runners in the intake. The car runs out of breath at 4500 RPM. It's easy to swap on GT40 irons and a B-cam, but you're looking at what? Like maybe 280WHP and a cam that creates a lope so hard it's awful to drive in parking lots. Aluminum heads are great and all, but you're looking at spending $2500 for a top end kit, plus long tubes (which never fit properly with an X-pipe), and you're now making 340WHP. Whoopee. The only reason the cars run so well in the 1/4 is because they're light (due to all the thin body work). Honestly, the easiest way to make power with these things is forced induction. Slap a turbo or supercharger on it with 7-8 psi and it'll make 400 WHP all day. Push it further and you shatter the block. The girdles don't add much strength. It basically just holds the insides together in one giant broken mess instead of being scattered everywhere.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nThe transmission (T5) is okay. It's not the strongest thing in the world, but it's fine to about 350WHP. Beyond that and you run the risk of shattering 3rd gear with one poorly timed shift. Upside: they're DIRT CHEAP to rebuild and the shifter feel is GREAT because the shifter is directly mounted in the trans. The aluminum throw-out bearing shaft is fucking stupid though.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nErgonomically, they're a \"meh\" as well. The cars with airbags didn't have tilting steering wheels (thanks, Ford). The shifter is too far forward and too low (though, a nice Steeda Tri-ax can raise it to a VERY comfortable position). The steering wheel isn't centered on the seat, and neither are the pedals. The pedals are on 3 different planes. The clutch is super high, brake in the middle, and the gas pedal is on the floor. It makes it a pain to heel-toe without raising the gas pedal, and the super high clutch isn't fun in traffic. The interior plastic is held on with drywall screws. The seats are comfortable, but not supportive or strong. Without subframe connectors, the seats flex the floorpan so much it will crack and break.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nTL,DR: The whole car is a compromise not worthy of time or budget. It runs on nostalgia and nothing else. There are vastly better cars from that timeframe. There are newer, better cars that can be had for the same price that will do what it does. For what you could spend on one to make it go, stop, and turn with any sort of competency is going to put you in the price range of a cheap C5 (about 10 grand). Skip the foxbody, you'll find no sanctuary here.","score":"25","subreddit":"cars"}

{"body":"Really appreciate pros speaking up and sharing their opinions in a constructive, logical way like this. These guys have put in more hours into the game than any of us. They have a vested interest in making the game the best it can be, and they have the knowledge to change. Listen to them, 343. As for my thoughts:\n\nRadar -- competitively should be removed imo. At the very least it should be spartan abilities only. Straight up free, unearned information that rewards less skilled plays like camping with shotgun. I'm going to be honest, I have no idea why it's still in the competitive settings. [Tiberius Audley, Team Liquid's analyst, does a much better job explaining this than I ever can.](http://mtaudleyenough.blogspot.ca/2015/12/ambiguous-revelation-dangers-of.html) \n\nPower weapons -- Current settings make play way snowball-y. Once a team gets control, especially on certain maps, it's very difficult for the other team to come back. Don't get me wrong, good strats should be rewarded, but it needs to be proportional. Some comination of reducing ammo, increasing the time gaps between spawns, and nerfing/removing certain weapons from competitive would be good. \n\nSprint -- lol. I mean, it doesn't really add anything to the skill gap, but in H5 anyway it doesn't take much away from it either. So really it's clear it's only there to appeal to some vague notion of the \"modern FPS player\". Except the modern FPS players play games like CSGO, Overwatch, and Doom, which lack sprint, as much as they play sprint-laden games like CoD. So that's not really an argument anymore. Sprint should be evaluated on its merits in gameplay, not whether other games are doing it. Member when Halo was the innovator, not the copycat? I member. \n\nI'm surprised he didn't mention splinter nades, aka get out of jail free cards. Rewarding less skilled players can't coincide with attempts to grow a game's competitive scene, so I don't know why that exists. \n\nOutside of gameplay: spec mode needs fixing, aiming and ghost melees too (apparently this CU should do this!), MLG should get involved again IMO. This is how you make Halo viable as an esport again. \n\n-- \nThere is a reason why competitive settings have been separate from standard settings, and the player bases of the two are not mutually exclusive. Any argument for \"universal settings\" falls on its face with empirical data -- H5 is barely a bigger esport than it was a year ago despite millions in prize pools and all the other stuff, and I think it's time 343 realizes you can't just buy your way into the big leagues. Will fewer people play competitive if it's a separate playlist? I doubt it: **Halo's appeal has always been the myriad of things you can do in it**: grifball, or infection, or multiteam, or snipers, or hardcore, or customs, or this, or that...\n\nWhich is how 343 fucked up with H5. By launching with like 7 playlists they forced everyone to compromise, and as a result no single Halo community was truly satisfied. Let people play Halo how they want to play it and they'll never leave again. It's what made H3 great, it can make 343 Halo great too. ","score":"119","subreddit":"halo"}

But if a company can deny service to anyone based on their religion or views, an owner of a grocery store can deny a gay couple from shopping there, and if it's only one is in the area, it will effectively cut their food supply and force them to move. That treads far, far more heavily on freedom in America.\n\u0026gt; Uh, I would hope every single manager would higher a more qualified person over a less qualified one, what are you even saying? Do you seriously suggest we should hire trans people who are less qualified, just because they are trans?\n\nI know personally two business owners that would 100% never hire a gay or trans person if they could, they would not give a damn if the lgbt person was 10 times more qualified. Some people (many, really) hold their personal and religious beliefs far above making money. Hell, there was even some landlords in my town that refused to rent to Natives because they hated them so much, even when it was hard to find renters and they lost money for it. Edit: I am pretty sure what the person you responded to just mixed up the order, that seems quite obvious to me. I don't think anyone in their right mind would fault someone for hiring the most qualified and suitable person for the job. If a lgbt individual is less qualified and suitable than a straight person, the straight person should get the job. Simple meritocracy. But this also works when the roles are reversed.\n\nEqual protection under the law should be that no one can discriminate against anyone for who they are. I know it really would suck to bake that Nazi cake, but that also means that the Jewish person can go to the Neonazi's business and order services from him (not that he would, but the Neonazi would have to serve him if the Jew wanted to go to his business). \n\nAnother point here is that being gay or trans is NOT a choice, being religious is. If your religion is so opposed to homosexuality, it was your choice to remain in it and discriminate. Gays/trans never had a choice in their sexual orientation (I am not talking the idiot special snowflakes that think they have 18 different genders; they do make that choice). \n\nTo address freedom on a large scale, your thought is also misguided. You're an atheist (as am I). If owners have the right to not hire me or not serve me because of this, that is a fucking huge violation of basic human rights. The way people should act is that they don't have to like or agree with every religion, sexual orientation, view, etc but they MUST tolerate it. I, of course, do not mean shit like crimes or religious views of murdering heathens, etc.  The law should reflect this. A business owner can hate gays/trans all he likes but he must tolerate them at a basic level. Now that is freedom. \n\nEdit 2: I want to thank you for actually posting your side and debating. I feel it's much more important to talk the opposing side and see where they come from and understand each other, rather than the usual mud slinging that I see in many subs and threads. I may not agree with you, but I think it's good you're here talking and wanting to see our side too. ","score":"16","subreddit":"lgbt"}

{"body":"[**Part 1 of 2**]\n\nThe NF/NT/SJ/SP foursome came from David Keirsey, who's probably most famous for his view that each of those groups has characteristics in common (and differs from the other three groups) to an extent that significantly exceeds the other possible two-letter groupings.\n\nAs further discussed in [this PerC post,](http://personalitycafe.com/myers-briggs-forum/147485-everybody-wants-n-9.html#post3753492) Keirsey really started out as (and largely remained, through *Please Understand Me II*) an MBTI guy, but liked to frame his famous foursome as if it also carried on a grand, historical four-type tradition. But the purported match-ups he pointed to between his MBTI-based types and various older foursomes were often pretty strained.\n\nI've long thought that the right way to read Keirsey is as a guy who had a lot of good insights into the MBTI types (and a talent for bringing them to life on the page) — including interesting (although not always correct) things to say about his favored two-letter combinations — but without buying into his view that there was something truly fundamental about the NF/NT/SJ/SP carve-up.\n\nIsabel Myers was a big believer that there were lots of noteworthy aspects of personality associated with *combinations* of preferences, and the 1985 MBTI Manual (which she co-authored) included brief descriptions of *every possible two-letter combination*. But NF/NT/ST/SF was Myers' favored foursome, and I can't resist noting that it's a carve-up of the types that *totally ignores* the so-called \"cognitive functions.\" (Each of Myers' four groups consists of types with *four different dominant functions*.)\n\nMyers explained why she thought NF/NT/ST/SF was the most meaningful way to group the types in *Gifts Differing*. She said:\n\n\u0026gt;Each of these combinations produces a different kind of personality, characterized by the *interests, values, needs, habits of mind, and surface traits that naturally result* from the combination. Combinations with a common preference will share some qualities, but each combination has qualities all its own, arising from the *interaction* of the preferred way of looking at life and the preferred way of judging what is seen.\n\n\u0026gt;Whatever a person's particular combination of [S/N and T/F] preferences may be, others with the same combination are apt to be the easiest to understand and like. They will tend to have similar interests, since they share the same kind of perception, and to consider the same things important, since they share the same kind of judgment.\n\nKeirsey didn't think much of Myers' S groups. In explaining how he got from Myers to NF/NT/SJ/SP, he said:\n\n\u0026gt;I soon found it convenient and useful to partition Myers's sixteen types into four groups, which she herself suggested in saying that all of what she referred to as the \"NFs\" were alike in many ways and that all four of the \"NTs\" were alike in many ways — although what she called the \"STs\" seemed to me to have very little in common, just as the \"SFs\" had little in common.\n\nWhich brings me to a little study that I haz performed...\n\nThe official MBTI folks put out Career Reports that show the popularity for each type of \"22 broad occupational categories,\" based on \"a sample of more than 92,000 people in 282 jobs who said they were satisfied with their jobs.\" That's a *large* freaking sample by personality typology standards, and it included 5,830 ISFJs, 11,410 ISTJs, 3,230 ISFPs, 5,114 ESTPs, 4,321 ESFPs and 12,019 ESTJs.\n\nTo give you an indication of the nature of the stats, here are the \"Most Attractive Job Families\" (job satisfaction scores of 60-100) for the ESFPs:\n\n**Health Care Support**  [100]  \n—Nurse's aide, veterinary assistant, pharmacy aide, physical therapy aide  \n**Food Preparation and Service**  [99]  \n—Chef, food service manager, bartender, host/hostess  \n**Personal Care and Service**  [91]  \n—Lodging manager, personal trainer, hairdresser, child care provider  \n**Office and Administrative Support**  [70]  \n—Bank teller, receptionist, clerical services, legal secretary  \n**Sales and Advertising**  [62]  \n—Sales manager, real estate agent, insurance agent, salesperson  \n**Building and Grounds Maintenance**  [60]  \n—Gardener, tree trimmer, housekeeping, lawn service supervisor\n\nAnd again, there are 22 categories in all.\n\nI don't have a full set of those Career Report stats, but I have them for the six S types previously mentioned, and it occurred to me to wonder whether the occupational preferences of SJs tend to be more alike than the occupational preferences of STs (as Keirsey's perspective would arguably lead you to believe) or *vice versa* (more in line with Myers' perspective).\n\nSo I decided to calculate what you might call the *total distance* between the job choices of those six S types by totaling the 22 differences in job satisfaction ratings. And here are the results:\n\nISFJ vs. ISTJ (both SJs): 737  \nISFJ vs. ISFP (both SFs): 337  \n\nESTP vs. ESFP (both SPs): 659  \nESTP vs. ESTJ (both STs): 375  \n\nIn both cases the results favor Myers' perspective — that ST/SF is a more meaningful way to group the S's than SJ/SP — and by a *very wide margin*.\n\nAnd noooooooooooo, I'm not saying this *disproves* the fundamentality of Keirsey's temperaments by any means, but I *am* saying I consider those results some serious *food for thought*. Career choices are a big part of a person's life — not to mention an aspect of life that Myers and Keirsey both thought (consistent with decades of data) tends to be substantially influenced by your type — and 92,000 is a huge sample, and those ST/SF-vs.-SJ/SP results are *dramatically lopsided*.\n\nMy perspective continues to be that it's probably a mistake to put too much emphasis on *any* particular grouping of the 16 types, including Myers'. As reflected in the MBTI Manual, I assume there are probably noteworthy and insightful things to be said about *each* of the possible two-letter combinations.\n\nAnd for anyone who's interested, I talk about why I tend to think of INs as my peeps in Part 2 of this comment.\n","score":"15","subreddit":"mbti"}

{"body":"\u0026gt;Why do you need your guns?\n\nI don't know that \"need\" has anything to do with it, and I don't feel compelled to start from a position of having to justify why I want a firearm. A just society should start from a basic premise that everything is legal unless there's a damn good reason to make it illegal.\n\nI can wear red socks on Thursdays not because there's a law saying I can, but because there's no law saying I can't. I don't \"need\" to wear red socks on Thursdays, but the onus also isn't on me to justify why I need to.\n\nI carry for self-defense. I'm not paranoid. I don't believe I'll ever use my firearm. I don't go looking for trouble. Carrying doesn't embolden me - I don't go anywhere or do anything armed that I wouldn't do unarmed.\n\nSo why do it? Well, why not? It takes 15 seconds in the morning to pull my pistol out of my safe. It takes another 15 seconds to put it away at night. Other than that, and an enjoyable couple hours going to the range every month or so just to put holes in paper, there's no big commitment.\n\nThere are also the Shit-Hit-The-Fan possibilities to consider. I'm pro-abortion, pro-gay rights, pro-separation of church and state, etc, and if things were to get too far out of line in this country (you know how our election turned out, right?) I might find myself needing to protect myself and others. I'd rather do that armed than unarmed.\n\n\u0026gt;Why do you need so many guns?\n\n\"Need\" again, eh? I need a small revolver because I often wish to pocket carry. I need a Glock 19 because it just works, shoots 9mm, and has a decent capacity. I need a 22lr rifle because it's my wife's from when she was a kid. I need a 12ga shotgun because I used to hunt with it. I need a break-action 410 shotgun because it's mine from when I was a kid. I need an AR-15 because the democratic party is intent on making them illegal. (seriously, they're fun to shoot and have self-defense uses, but the only reason I bought one is that Clinton might have won.)\n\n\u0026gt;Why do you need an assault rifle?\n\nSee above. Note that it's very expensive and rather difficult to get a select fire rifle. What's generally available is semi-automatic rifles, not fully automatic. In other words, almost no civilians have access to the same rifles that are available to the military or police.\n\n\u0026gt;Isn't better/safer to not have one of those?\n\nThey exist, and as long as they do, I'm safer having one than not. It's very rare for them to be used in crimes, btw.\n\n\u0026gt;Isn't the government responsibility to keep you safe?\n\nNope. They may be responsible for the general welfare, they have no duty towards the individual. I can call the police and tell them that there is an armed man standing outside my door telling me that he's going to blow up my house in 4 hours, and the police can choose to simply ignore me. The only time the police have a legal duty to protect me is when they've taken on that duty by forcing me into their custody. (That is, if they arrest you and deprive you of your liberty, then they also have a duty to give you at least some minimum amount of protection while you're in their custody.)\n\nEven if the government did have a duty to protect, there's no way than could possibly carry out that duty. You'll often hear people say that they carry a firearm because police officers are too heavy and there aren't enough of them.\n\nI'm going to assume that you don't live in a country with zero crime, so a government that can't or won't keep every citizen safe isn't a foreign concept to you.

The number one thing that changes my mind about someone is if they offer their support without being asked. If they're interested in helping and help because it's the right thing to do. It proves that you're a good person and that people can trust you.\n\nThe difficult part is understanding a person's culture and personality.

{"body":"\u0026gt;It encouraged Invoker to farm just because he started to need farm to exist and be decent.\n\nExcept so do most scaling mids that have his insane peak mid to late game? And just because he farmed for the first 20-25 minutes he was still strong early on with the global presence sunstrike, split pushing and pressuring towers. At his peak a few patches back he literally dominated every stage of the game with very strong laning, even stronger mid game once he got aghs, and easily the best late game mid. \n\nHe needed to be weak at some point to justify his mid-late game ability. Do people forget people (pros) used invoker in early game push strats, dominating the lane and building necrobook + forge spirits and win the game in 20-25 minutes (often paired with beastmaster + venge). The fact he had the best late game of any mid and no stage in the game he wasn't super strong is what made him OP. Every other hero is either weaker early stronger late or stronger early and then falls off. \n\nNow he is actually in a good place. He is weaker early and stronger late. He is balanced. 15th most picked hero at Boston, 49% winrate. 52 games vs Lunas 70 (and 52% win rate).\n\nI have no idea how harshly the new changes will affect him, but they do not seem like that huge of a nerf. More quas regen/exort damage helps you trade better over time in lane, while less stats makes you more vulnerable to ganks. Forge spirits nerf is big, but remember the patch as a whole increased levelling speed. This means he can get to that big deafening blast dominate the game quicker. I put my faith in icefrog to give him any tiny buffs/nerfs he may need to keep him at the fair and balanced 6.88 level. ","score":"16","subreddit":"DotA2"}

Then they started adding shields and powerups, then they added sprinting, like CoD, then the game was ded. \n\nI've seen it with CoD, they just kept adding new features to make it \"look\" different from the previous version to justify selling it, they would make the maps more visually \"enhanced\" but really they just put a bunch of dogshit on the maps making it shit. \n\nI've seen it with SC2, Oracle added in LOTV and Terran was wiped off the fucking planet.\n\nI've seen it with so many games and I promise it will be the end of Dota. The players who hate this will seriously considering trying LoL or HOTS.\n\nUnfortunately I doubt it would be possible for Dota 2 as we knew it to be played competitively, because of the money involved.

{"body":"\nTOUKOKUUSSA 2015 Oulun-junasta saapui Helsingin rautatieasemalle tavallisen oloinen nuorimies. 173-senttinen tummahiuksinen tyyppi, jolla on korkea otsa.\n\nTällä tavallisen oloisella nuorukaisella oli kuitenkin poikkeukselliset vaatteet. Noin 500 euroa maksanut takki oli Armanin, Guccin vyö maksoi 300 euroa. Tomi kertoi päällään olevien vaatteiden hinnat ja ynnäsimme ne yhteen. Summaksi saimme noin 1 800 euroa.\n\nTomi oli merkkivaatteistaan selvästi mielissään. Hän ylpeili niillä myös sosiaalisessa mediassa. Instagram-tilinsä kuvissa Tomi esitteli kaulakoruaan saatesanoin: Viis hunttia kaulassa.\n\nKuvat ovat hämmentävän häpeilemättömiä. Ranteessa Michael Korsin rannekello. 24 karaatin kullalla päällystetty kannabissavuke. Kokoelma Armanin takkeja, Seikon noin 3 000 euroa maksava Astron-rannekello. Pino 50 euron seteleitä rullalla.\n\nJuttelimme täyden työpäivän. Tomi kuvaili yksityiskohtaisesti, miten carding eli verkkokaupoissa toisten luottokorttitiedoilla tehtävät petokset toteutetaan. Sain osoitteet Tor-verkon sivustoille, joista voi ostaa dumppeja eli tietomurtojen avulla hankittuja luottokorttinumeroita.\n\nHän kertoi myös, mistä löydetään muuli eli ihminen, joka nostaa rahat, ja millaisiin osoitteisiin hän pyysi korteilla tilattuja tavaroita toimitettaviksi.\n\nTomi ei vaikuttanut peittelevän mitään. Hän kertoi, miten oli löytänyt tietokoneet 10-vuotiaana, miten oli tutustunut Nikoon ja kuinka Osuuspankin palvelut kaatanut operaatio oli tapahtunut.\n\n”Ei ollut muutakaan tekemistä”, hän perusteli hyökkäystään pankkeja vastaan.\n\nTomi tiesi, että Osuuspankki tulisi vaatimaan häneltä mittavia vahingonkorvauksia. Mutta keväällä 2015 Tomi ei vielä murehtinut korvausvaatimuksista. Tai näin hän ainakin vakuutteli.\n\nKovin katuvainen Tomi ei ollut. Jäi vaikutelma, että hän oli joistakin rikoksistaan jopa ylpeä. ”Jos nyt katsoo taaksepäin, olisi ne pankit voinut jättää väliinkin ja keskittyä muuhun tekemiseen. Mutta tehty mikä tehty.”\n\nSilti Tomi puhui verkkorikollisuudesta ”järkevänä rikollisuutena, joka voittaa leikiten jonkun Siwan ryöstämisen. Hyöty on paljon suurempi.”\n\nTOMI ja Niko eivät ole suinkaan ainoita rikoksiin sortuneita teinihakkereita. Yksi nuorena aloittaneista on espoolaisteini, joka on käyttänyt nimimerkkejä Zeekill ja Ryan.\n\nHän aloitti verkkorikosten teon jo 13- tai 14-vuotiaana ja oli 17-vuotias, kun hänet viime kesänä tuomittiin kahden vuoden ehdolliseen vankeuteen noin 50 700 tietomurrosta.\n\nMaaliskuussa 2016 poliisi otti kiinni kolme alle kaksikymppistä nuortamiestä epäiltynä useista palvelunestohyökkäyksistä. Kohteena oli muun muassa puolustusministeriö.\n\nMyös he ottivat yhteyttä minuun ja halusivat kertoa hyökkäyksistään itse ennen kuin poliisi tiedotti ottaneensa nuorukaiset kiinni.\n\nLaista piittaamattomat teinihakkerit ovat tyypillisesti persoja julkisuudelle, vaikka he esiintyvät nimimerkeillä. He haluavat mainetta ja kunniaa siellä missä heidät tunnetaan, kaltaistensa piirissä.\n\nValtaosa teinien verkko­rikoksista ei silti koskaan päädy otsikoihin. Valtaosasta he eivät edes jää kiinni. Ne ovat pieniä rötöksiä ja muistuttavat myymälävarkauksia: kolttoset havaitaan jälkijunassa ja haitat kirjataan kiltisti hävikkiin.\n\nInternetiä voisi verrata valtavaan ostoskeskukseen, jossa useista kaupoista puuttuvat valvontakamerat ja hälyttimet. Vartijoitakin on liian vähän. Tällä jättiostarilla rettelöivät ja rötöstelevät nuorukaiset, jotka istuvat omissa huoneissaan maapallon jokaisessa kolkassa. Kuulokkeet korvilla he keskustelevat näppäimistöillä ja imevät tietoja ja taitoja kaltaisiltaan.\n\nMOTIIVEJA on kolme: maine, raha ja jännitys, sanoo rikoskomisario Tero Muurman.\n\nKeskusrikospoliisissa työskentelevä Muurman on toiminut tutkinnanjohtajana kahdessa eri rikosvyyhdissä, joissa Tomi on epäiltynä. Palvelunestohyökkäysten lisäksi Muurman tutki luottokorttipetosten sarjaa, josta Tomi oli vangittuna uudelleen syksyllä 2015.\n\nMuurman johti myös tutkintaa, jonka tuloksena espoolaisteini Zeekill tuomittiin kymmenistätuhansista tietomurroista.\n\n”Tietyissä piireissä saa mainetta pahanteolla. Mainetta voi muuttaa rahaksi, jos voi myydä taitojaan sitten, kun on päässyt piireihin. Joskus motiivina voi olla myös silkka kiusanteko”, hän sanoo.\n\n”Jotkut hakevat jännitystä. Kun ennen potkittiin autojen peilejä, nyt dossataan verkkosivuja.”\n\nDossaaminen on tietotekniikkaslangia, joka tulee kirjainlyhenteestä DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service). Suomeksi se tarkoittaa hajautettua palvelunestohyökkäystä: juuri sitä, millä Tomi lamautti OP-pankin kaksi vuotta sitten.\n\nTeinihakkereista tiedetään kuitenkin vielä kovin vähän. Muurmanin mukaan tutkimusta tarvitaan.\n\n”Ilmiö on kansainvälinen, joten tuloksilla olisi varmasti käyttöä myös ennalta ehkäisevässä työssä”, Muurman sanoo.\n\nTällä hetkellä ennalta ehkäisevää työtä ei ole. Eikä teinihakkereiden käyttäytymistä ole helppo muuttaa.\n\n”Olemmehan me yrittäneet esimerkiksi vangitsemisia, mutta joskus on kulunut vain viikko siitä, kun tekijä on päässyt vapaaksi, ja sama meno jatkuu. Eikä ihmisiä voi eristää loputtomiin.”\n\nHarva nuori tai aikuisempikaan hakkeri tulee ajatelleeksi, kuinka suuriin ongelmiin verkkorikokset voivat johtaa.\n\nEsimerkiksi Suomen ja Britannian kansalainen Lauri Love käy parhaillaan oikeustaistelua sitä vastaan, että Britannia luovuttaisi hänet Yhdysvaltoihin. Lovea odottavat syytteet useista tietomurroista, joista voi Yhdysvalloissa seurata ainakin teoriassa jopa 99 vuoden vankeustuomio.\n\nVertailun vuoksi: Suomessa ankarin rangaistus törkeästä tietomurrosta on viisi vuotta.\n\n”Minun mielestäni nämä nuoret pelaavat hyvin lyhytnäköistä peliä”, Muurman sanoo.\n\n”He saavat maineen toisaalla, mutta yhteiskunnan silmissä he menettävät sen. Moni ei ota huomioon, kuinka pitkälle jäljet verkossa ulottuvat. Teoista voi olla kiinnostuneita muidenkin maiden viranomaiset. Silloin esimerkiksi ulkomaan lomamatka voi muuttua tyystin toisenlaiseksi mitä alun perin on suunnitellut.”\n\nTero Muurman arvioi, että aktiivisia nuoria verkkorikollisia eli teinihakkereita on Suomessa noin kymmenkunta.\n\nSamaan hengenvetoon komisario toisaalta sanoo, että hänen tietonsa ovat puutteellisia. Läheskään kaikki verkkorikosten uhrit eivät edes huomaa joutuneensa uhreiksi. Yrityksetkään eivät mielellään ilmoita rikoksista mainehaittojen pelossa. Piilorikollisuutta on paljon.\n\nMoni nuori verkkorikollinen syyttää omista rikoksistaan puutteellista tietoturvaa. He ajattelevat jotenkin näin: tein tietomurron, koska se oli mahdollista ja siksi murron kohteeksi joutuneen oma vika.\n\nSilti julkisuuteen nousseista teinihakkereista vain harvaa pidetään tietoturva-alan ammattilaisten parissa erityisen kyvykkäänä.\n\nHe ovat kuin pankkirosvoja, jotka eivät peitä kasvojaan valvontakameroiden edessä. He joutuvat vastuuseen teoistansa.\n\nPALVELUNESTOHYÖKKÄYSTEN ja siihen liittyvien muiden rikosten esitutkinta valmistui joulukuussa 2015. Vasta noin vuotta myöhemmin, 20. joulukuuta 2016, Helsingin kihlakunnansyyttäjä Kukka-Maaria Kankaala nosti Tomia vastaan syytteet yhdestätoista eri rikoksesta.\n\nTörkeä tietojärjestelmän häirintä, kaksi tietojärjestelmän häirintää, yksi tietojärjestelmän häirinnän yritys, kaksi kiristyksen yritystä, törkeä kiristyksen yritys, vaaran aiheuttaminen tietojenkäsittelylle, luvaton käyttö, petos ja maksuvälinepetos.\n\nOikeudenkäynti alkanee talvella 2017. HS:n tietojen mukaan Tomille vaaditaan jopa ehdotonta vankeutta.\n\nOsuuspankki vaatii Tomilta 455 000 euron korvauksia. Se vastaa keskipalkkaisen suomalaisen 15 vuoden nettotuloja.\n\nSoitan Tomille joulunalusviikolla kaksi tuntia sen jälkeen, kun hän on saanut tietää syytteistä.\n\n”Vähän mietityttää toi”, Tomi kertoo puhelimessa. Äänessä ei ole uhoa.\n\nTomi kertoo olevansa Imatralla kotinsa parvekkeella. Hän on juonut kuulemma aamukahvit sähköpostin ääressä.\n\n”Toisaalta on hyvä fiilis, että tämä asia menee eteenpäin. On sitä jo odoteltukin.”\n\nTomi on tunnustanut monia rikoksiaan, mutta pankkien kiristämisen hän kiistää. Hän väittää, että kiristysviestit olivat pelkkää julkisuuden kerjäämistä.\n\n”Mä olen sellainen ollut aina, että huomio kiinnostaa.”\n\nNykyään Tomi tapaa kavereitaan, nukkuu myöhään, käy yökerhoissa. Hän kertoo, ettei ole enää Nikon kanssa juuri tekemisissä. Niko asuu nykyisin toisella paikkakunnalla.\n\nMakea elämä maistuu Tomille yhä. Hän haluaisi kovasti matkoille, mutta saa passin vain kuukaudeksi kerrallaan.\n\nJoulun alla Tomi julkaisi Instagramissa kuvan ostoksistaan Alkossa. Taustalla pilkottaa Dom Pérignon -samppanjapullo ja etualalla kuitti: loppusumma 325 euroa.\n\nHän kertoo tekevänsä nykyisin ”ihan laillisia hommia”, virtuaalivaluuttakauppaa. Tomi ei enää puhu raha-asioistaan yhtä avoimesti kuin aiemmin. Ei ainakaan puhelimessa.\n\n”Olen pitänyt huolen siitä, että elämässä pitää olla hauskaa”, hän kuittaa.\n\nMitä hän aikoo tehdä uutenavuotena?\n\n”Varmaan lähdetään kavereiden kanssa johonkin isompaan kaupunkiin, jossa on paremmat meiningit. Juodaan alkoholia ja juhlitaan.”\n\nNikoa syytetään vuonna 2013 tapahtuneista kolmesta tietojärjestelmän häirinnästä ja yhdestä kiristyksen yrityksestä. Nikoa ei syytetä kahden vuoden takaisista hyökkäyksistä. Nikon nimi on muutettu. Tomin oikea etunimi on Tomi.","score":"22","subreddit":"Suomi"}

And how did he recognize French so quickly, instead of it being some dumb kid?\n\n\n- When she got access to the internet, was she completely imagining searching Homer on Youtube (which in the video he says something like \"I'm not stopping until I have that ring,\" which aligns with her story of how they lost Homer's ring, and connects past and present)? Also, no one witnessed her search google in (the present), so why would this instance have occurred? No one was questioning Homer's existence then... Except for her. \nIt seemed that she was relieved to see homer in the 2007 video. She knew he was alive after the video was posted, so she wasn't worried whether he was alive or not... because she met him after the video was posted, after his first NDE. She was questioning if it actually all happened or not before, so I think that she was relieved to see that he \"existed.\" But maybe I'm overanalyzing. Maybe she was just glad to see him.\n\n\n- Where did the books come from (I know this is a question for you too.)? If they were Amazon shipped, she would have had 24-48 hours to read all of that.

Brilliant but insane. \n\nShuuichi finally got a moment to show who he is, this show has forcibly taken that away from him throughout the season, so having this quiet moment with Kumiko was a long time coming and really nice. \n\nReina finally managed to truly fit in with those outside of Kumiko, she's laid out her anxieties now and there's a really nice moment of acceptance and comradery for it. \n\nSeems a lot of distaste for the lack of a final performance, I don't think they could of done enough to really differentiate it from mid season, and this was a moment of conciliation for many character arcs whereas mid-season was a moment of team triumph, I feel the piece definitely needed to be in episode 5.\n\nOverall this episode was amazing, Hibike has been my favourite Kyoani show since season 1 and this continues to solidify that idea, it just seems to create drama and character threads that sit really well with me.

Taiga softly rubs her feet against Ryuuji's back, and very nearly says out loud:\n\n*\"That dream, it wasn't so bad.\"*\n \nTaiga has come to a realization that,  actually yeah, a life with Ryuuji wouldn't be all that bad would it?\n\nRegardless of the romantic implications between the two in this scene, it primarily establishes just how comfortable, and *intimate*, they are with each other.\n\nThe fact that Taiga is the one to vocalise these thoughts is perhaps indicative of the lack of intimacy in the rest of her life. Ryuuji at least has his mother around.\n\nTaiga doesn't really know what to make of these feelings, and as such chooses not to talk about them.\n\nYou can tell they are both happy with each other though.

{"body":"Oh God. We’re finally here. It’s been 63 episodes. We’re finally, finally here at the very last leg of the journey and damn, is it satisfying. I’m usually a hardcore lurker around these parts but I can’t resist jumping in to ramble about one of the best episodes I’ve ever seen in an anime.\n\n\nThe significance of Ed’s last transmutation is absolutely incredible because it’s not only the culmination of his character arc, in a single scene it manages to encompass the entirety of everything that FMA stands for. **It’s all about Edward Elric choosing humanity over alchemy.**\n\n\nEd started off as an arrogant, hot headed little prick of a main character. He’s not just “Edward Elric”, he’s “the talented child alchemist” or “the young prodigy”. His identity is always pinned to his status as the Fullmetal Alchemist first and foremost. Everything he has achieved thus far, it’s because of his powers. Because without it, he’s nothing. He believed that the only way to accomplish any of his goals was to rely on his supernatural abilities.\n\n\nNot now. Here he chooses to give it up instead and commit to a final sacrifice to regain what truly matters. This entire time he’s believed that alchemy is the answer, but now he understands that the real answer is to let go of it.\n\n\nWhat makes the end of his character arc so satisfying is that every single thing in this series has gone unwasted. Every single thing in this series has affected Ed in some way, shape or  form, to lead up to this moment. Nina Tucker totally could have just served as emotional baggage for Ed, but not in FMA. She has never left Ed’s thoughts and she comes *back* here to reiterate the lesson that even with his prestigious alchemic knowledge, Ed can be *powerless*. The episode in Rush Valley that most people dismissed as filler, it’s NOT. You can read my writeup that I wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5a7xr5/spoilersrewatch_fullmetal_alchemist_brotherhood/d9eh3aa/), but I’ll restate what I said. That episode is a testament to the power of humans. Winry is the representation of the strength of humanity. Even if she’s not an alchemist, she’s the one who gave them the legs to stand on. She’s the one who was able to break equivalent exchange and give up on revenge against Scar. She’s the one who serves as an emotional crutch to the Elric brothers. She’s the one that Ed has unsurmountable respect for because she, a simple human, has the power to give life (and help deliver the baby) without having to abide by the binding laws of alchemy. \n\n\nAll of this leads up to the moment Ed stands in front of the gate and his monumental decision. He chooses to throw away his meaningless title of “alchemist”, the title on which he staked almost his entire identity,  in favor of  embracing “humanity”. He throws away hubris and the pursuit of power over love, family, and ultimately **humility**. Here, stripped of all titles and all arrogance, Edward Elric stands before Truth not as the Fullmetal Alchemist, but as a human, and he is stronger for it. Because unlike Father, who sought to elevate himself above humanity and use knowledge in pursuit of power, Ed won because he understood Truth. He didn’t “lower” himself to the level of humans. He realized that a mere, weak human was all he ever was in the first place. Contrary to the belief that Ed is now powerless without alchemy, it’s the exact opposite. He’s powerful because he’s human, and even if we can be weak and timid and fearful, humanness will always win over the delusional pursuit of godhood. \n\n\nIn over 60 episodes, the little midget gradually transformed into the humble person we see now. The enormity of Edward Elric [standing before the Gate of Truth](http://i.imgur.com/PDc1Arg.png) is just absolutely incredible. \n","score":"19","subreddit":"anime"}

He was the best at knowing what would sell things to regular people. How would something change your life. I honestly have not seen an iPhone feature since the 4 with Facetime that's really blown me away. Siri originally too. Every year it's just...thinner, smaller, less buttons and inputs, faster, same battery life. Really nothing else of major interest though. I want the love back. MS showing off the Surface Studio was way more akin to Steve Jobs than anything I've seen from Apple in the last few years. Every event is just Tim trying to act like he's connecting to the audience in a way no one else can, Craig making jokes about his hair, Phil showing off hardware that even he seems to know is horribly underpowered.\n\nThey became too big. Too profit driven. They started with a passion for making computers for regular people and Steve was there while they invented amazing products that have changed the world. Now they're just continuing to drive the ship as long as possible.\n\nEDIT: My reference to \"thinner, smaller, less buttons and inputs, faster, same battery life\" was towards all of their products, not really only iPhone. Their laptops have lost all the momentum they had going leading up to the retina Macbook Pro. iMac's really haven't changed all that much aside from 5K screens. Mac Pro and Mac Mini have barely been touched. They're focused almost solely on their most profit making products and practically ignoring the others. Taking away most inputs, underpowered, etc.. iPhone interfaces have remained the same since the original. Also, in my opinion all the arguments for taptic feedback, touch ID and whatnot are not like my original argument. Those are all refinements or additions that improve an existing functionality. Taptic makes it feels nicer to interact with, 3D touch adds functionality yes but nothing revolutionary, Touch ID speeds up getting into the app and Apple Pay is nice yes but it doesn't really allow me to do anything that my credit or debit card couldn't do before. \n\nEDIT 2: Woke up to a lot of replies.

I find it interesting that you think Nar Shadaa is the place with the clearest agency, because I always found it kind of stupid. Attracting the attention of the Exchange to find the Jedi Master never made sense to me. Also, at a certain point the game snatches you from the middle of whatever you're doing and force you to start a long sequence during which you have to complete before doing anything else. That always sucks. I much prefer Onderon, where everything we do makes sense for a character who only wants to talk to Kavar and kind of gets caught up in the war. \n\nOne of the reasons Malachor fails as an ending is the random monsters on this supposedly lifeless planet. They shouldn't be there, are easy to defeat, and do not add to the story at all. It would have been much more effective to force us to wander through a wasteland filled with skeletons, maybe with Kreia talking to us through our bond about the devastation we wrought.

{"body":"I think you're right about a whole lot of this. However, I have two problems with just leaving people alone in their misery. First, I believe in a world where we care for each other and help each other. If someone is drowning - even if it is self-induced - don't we have an obligation to each other to hold out our hands in friendship? Should we allow our neighbors to suffer without even trying to help?\n\nSecondly, while it is certainly not true of all incels, some of the men here have very harmful ideas about others that can affect the way they treat people they encounter. Elliot Rodgers was an incel, whether or not he used that particular word to describe himself. Because the people in his life allowed him to suffer in relative silence, he and many others are dead. Obviously, most of the guys here aren't violent like Elliot, but their daily encounters with other people, especially women, are colored by their ideology. Having met people like this in person, I know how emotionally taxing it can be and how it can ruin your day. \n\nBasically, if we can help just one person, that has the power to enrich the lives of not only that person, but all the people whom they interact with. I can see this situation as being similar to a religious one. They say don't debate with religious people because they are by definition delusional and irrational....... but it worked for me. If many other people hadn't taken the time to point out each and every fault in my reasoning until the illusion was crushed, I probably still wouldn't be free from the yoke of religious dogma.

{"body":"I'd go\n\n1) ACOK - Bran. Very well-written chapter, notable since GRRM isn't really known for his prose being particularly great or anything, and its a great thematic capstone to the book. Plus it's a neat twist - Bran's alive! On my first read of ACOK I missed all the miller's boy implications and whatnot so this was a most pleasant surprise to me, and I remember the chapter fondly because of it.\n\n2) AGOT - Dany. Like you say OP, big game-changer. Great ending for Dany's arc. Very exciting, thrilling stuff.\n\n3) ADWD - Epilogue (Kevan). Snow on King's Landing, what an image. I've long liked Kevan and always wanted to see inside his head, so this was bittersweet - I indeed got to read him as a POV, but in an epilogue, so he was surely going to die. \n\n4) ASOS - Epilogue (Merrett). Not a huge fan of this one. Merrett didn't really click with me, and I'm not a huge fan of the Lady Stoneheart twist. I don't like resurrections in fantasy, and I feel having Cat come back (sort of) in the same book she died kind of undercut some of the impact for me. Still, certainly an exciting chapter.\n\n5) AFFC - Samwell. A nice enough chapter, but an extremely bizarre anticlimactic point to end the book. The symmetry with the prologue was neat,  but having such a non-starter of a chapter like this as the end of an ASOIAF novel exemplified the structural issues of AFFC to me. I love AFFC, it's my second or third favourite of the series, but man, it certainly had issues.","score":"26","subreddit":"asoiaf"}

{"body":"There's a few qualifiers that have to be tackled if these books are to be used by George to have Tyrion read them.\n\nFirst, they have to be something Tyrion hasn't read before. He reads everything he can get his hands on, he even gives Joffrey a wedding presents of the rare tome Lives of the Four Kings. So for one of these books to be an impacting reveal it should be something rare or unknown to Tyrion. And he had a moment in adwd where he laments some books he would like to read but has never found. Among those are Unnatural History by Septon Barth, Blood and Fire (or Death of Dragons), and the fires of the Freehold by Galendro. \n\nAmong those three, Unnatural History would be the best bet. It's a rare book that Tyrion wants, it's written in common and about Westeros history like Dany internally remarks when she receives the gifts from Jorah. Unnatural History is Septon Barth's masterwork about the biology of dragons deemed so dangerous by King Baelor I he had all copies he could find destroyed. Surely this tome would be useful to the dragon queen and Imp. And it would be a great twist if one of the remaining copies was in a dusty essos market, no one able to read it to know it's value in Westeros. \n\nHowever there's an even more intriguing possibility. The rarest book in the world, one that every scholar the world over would give a lifetime to see, and some like Marwyn have written books focusing on it. That tome is titled Signs and Portents. It is the record of Daenys the dreamer's visions and prophecies that lead the Targaryens to flee Valyria before the Doom. The intriguing part is that no one knows what else is in that book. Marwyn claims to have only seen three pages. What else is inside of a book that contains true, verified prophecy? \n\nOne idea is that this book may contain the Prince that was promised prophecy. Perhaps those three pages that Marwyn has are what convinced Rhaegar he was the prince himself. Or maybe it goes further. Perhaps in that book of prophecy is Daenerys' entire life and journey written down hundreds of years earlier, step by step by her ancestor Daenys. Perhaps the predictions of the future the Undying told to Dany were not their own but merely them relating the prophecy to her from a copy of Signs and Portents. The implications of Tyrion reading that book could be massive and disruptive or world saving depending on how Tyrion uses it. Of course because it is a lost book we have no idea what language it is in. Like Unnatural History it's possible that no one in the immediate area has any idea they have a book worth a fortune, and would sell it as a curious novelty to Jorah. It's so rare and obscure that you could see how it would end up lost in the hands of people who don't recognize it. \n\nUnnatural History is a more likely choice, but Signs and portents is a much more intriguing possibility. \n     ","score":"108","subreddit":"asoiaf"}

{"body":"The point is that the Glory is separated from the Power.\n\nThe Head of State symbolises the Nation. So in the USA sometimes criticising the President feels to them like criticising the nation, because for them the Glory and Power are tied in the same person. Which is why Bush got so much support when he invaded Iraq, while Blair got a million people demonstrating against him. \n\nA good Head of State like QEII, who keeps her mouth shut and acts purely as a symbol in ceremonial situations, can make people feel proud of their nation without inhibiting their ability to crtiticize power and politicians.\n\nImagine what Trump will do when he gets his hands on the Glory of the Presidency, people standing up and playing \"Hail to the Chief\" every time he walks into a room for example. Trudeau and Mrs May don't get that deference, it is reserved for the monarch who is a Symbol who wields no power at all. So even if the glory went to the Queen's head, she has no power to act on it.\n\nP.S. In Germany they have an elected head of State and a Chancellor, and in theory the glory should go to the President and the power to the Chancellor, but in practice the President is a nonentity and the Chancellor gets all the Glory and Power. Look at the mistakes Merkel has made over both the euro crisis and migrant crisis, but they are afraid of criticising her, because they would be criticising Mutti, the Mother of the Nation. The problem is exacerbated by the Grand Coalitions Germany has had for a decade, which means there is no opposition apart from tiny parties from the extreme left and right. It's an unhealthy situation and is the cause of the destruction of the EU.\n\nThe symbolic head of state needs to be a *glittering* person to attract the glory away from the seat of power, which is why constitutional monarchy works so well.\n\nIn France it's slightly different: they have essentially an Elected King, whom they guillotine regularly. So Chirac and Sarkozy were treated with reverence and then both put on trial when they left office. They'll find a way to get Hollande too, and De Gaulle was forced to resign when the French ignored him on Europe.","score":"25","subreddit":"canada"}

The measure is such that it must have serious consequences.

Borden's government stiffed them and violated those rights. Nobody from Laurier's government was promising Canada to be a free-to-enter promised land, only to charge Chinese immigrants as they arrived. They were doing it because the low cost of Chinese labour was depressing wages in British Columbia, and the idea of livable minimum wage is something we still haven't made peace with in this country.","score":"14","subreddit":"canada"}

{"body":"« Ecrivez au parquet »\n\nGarges-lès-Gonesse est à l’autre bout du district : un commissariat imposant, construit en forme de revolver. Sous les plafonds majestueux, les mots résonnent comme dans une cathédrale déserte : ils ne sont plus qu’une quinzaine depuis le rattachement à Sarcelles. La chaudière vient d’éclater. Elle ne sera pas changée : trop cher. Des radiateurs ont été apportés, certains de chez soi. Ici, on traite surtout les stupéfiants et la délinquance financière. « On nous demande de prioriser les fraudes contre la Caisse d’allocations familiales et la Sécurité sociale, dit une fonctionnaire. Il n’y en a pas tant que ça – de la survie, surtout. »\n\nParfois, quelqu’un appelle pour s’inquiéter d’un autre dossier. Presque invariablement, il s’entend répondre : « Ecrivez au parquet. » Il arrive que le parquet envoie à son tour un papier bleu : où en est l’enquête ? Alors, un fonctionnaire descend à la cave. Il traverse un fouillis de plantes en plastique, rescapées d’une visite officielle, et de vélos datant de l’époque où devaient se lancer des brigades à deux-roues. Et là, tout au fond de ce cimetière des ambitions brisées, le fonctionnaire ouvre un placard. 1 846 dossiers sont alignés : escroquerie, abus de confiance, paiement frauduleux… Le fonctionnaire pose le papier bleu sur l’affaire qui lui correspond. Au hasard : l’arnaque d’un joli moustachu de Sarcelles contre une infirmière de Rodez, rencontrée sur Meetic, 2 850 euros en 2013. Puis le fonctionnaire remonte. Il faudrait dix plein-temps pendant six mois pour les écluser. « Alors on attend que les procédures meurent toutes seules. »\n\nDepuis septembre, 493 nouvelles affaires ont déjà été ouvertes. Une gradée soupire : « Les petits jeunes me disent : “Et la considération des victimes ?” Ils se sentent humiliés, impuissants à combattre la délinquance. Ils le prennent à cœur, ils dépriment. Je dois faire attention. »\n\nEntre 2012 et 2014, quatre suicides ont frappé les équipes de Sarcelles. Depuis, un psychologue donne quelques heures de consultation, mais on préfère pousser discrètement la porte du capitaine Thierry Rolland, 55 ans. La photo d’un flic bronzé, botté haut et chevauchant une moto spectaculaire mange tout un mur de son bureau. « Et si tout ce que vous aimiez devenait votre métier ? », proclame l’affiche. Tout gamin, Thierry Rolland l’avait vue dans un commissariat : c’est d’elle que vient sa vocation. Il a fait son burn-out en janvier 2013. « Les collègues sont durs, l’un pensait que je simulais. » Il est un des seuls en France à accepter de briser le tabou et témoigner à visage découvert. « Ça me donne une raison de vivre. » Même si les statistiques restent discrètes, le nombre de morts par suicide dépasse largement celui des tués en service dans la police. Une mesure avait été mise en place, obligeant les flics à laisser leur arme au commissariat. Elle a été supprimée après l’attentat contre deux fonctionnaires, chez eux, à Magnanville, en juin.\n\nLe Boulet se sert un thé dans une tasse siglée « l’homme de ma vie ». L’employée de l’auto-école a formellement identifié Kevin. Elle a montré les résultats du test qu’il a passé exactement à l’heure du vol pour l’examen du code. Un ami, peut-être, aurait utilisé son mail ? Le magistrat a libéré Kevin.\n\nSur la chaise, en face du Boulet, Mathurin vient de s’asseoir. Il commence : « Tu crois que je vais te lécher les pieds ? » On vient de l’arrêter avec un portable arraché à un apprenti maçon.","score":"20","subreddit":"france"}

{"body":"I know it was patented, but that exact swing mechanic isn't necessary to fix a lot of the issues the ones after SM2 had with the swinging.  \n\nFall damage and sense of danger aside, the main issue with the feel of the swinging is momentum.  See how in [THIS CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8vvjOW1Nfc\u0026amp;t=18s), he falls off of a huge building and instantly loses all momentum when he starts swinging?  By the third swing, it's entirely gone.  And then he goes into that weird auto-movement thing, and don't even get me started on that.\n\nBut in the original Spider-Man 2, the farther you fell, the faster you would swing, and the faster your first swing, the faster your second swing would be.  It made sense, and it was fun because it felt real.  In [THIS CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc_3XSTwq-o\u0026amp;t=2m11s) (best I could find right now, sorry), you can see that the momentum of each jump and swing is actually carried onward, not just imitated.  The other danger besides fall damage is loss of speed, because they made speed fun.  If you hit a wall or the ground, guess what, you lose your speed.  That's why they put in mechanics like the wall run; to give you a tool to deal with that and keep the momentum or \"combo\" going.  \n\nBut now the \"combo\" is broken automatically each swing.  The new Spider-Man games took the punishment of screwing up in SM2, i.e. losing your momentum at the end of a swing, and made it the norm.  It doesn't matter if the swing mechanic of attaching to individual spots and boosting along got patented, all the other parts of the traversal have been made unfun.  \n\nI want to believe in Insomniac.

As a lifelong PC gamer I did a double take and googled a bit to verify that it wasn't bullshit, it just seemed so incredible. So in hindsight the outrage over Horse Armor and its pricing is less understandable to me than the lack of outrage over the other ridiculous price gouging that goes on on consoles.\n\nThough I will say small DLC wasn't as new as that Bethesda would have you believe.

What happens when one day someone has spinal damage, especially in the neck area, or if they're cut by a skate (like Richard Zednik) and the medical staff can't get to them? Hits to the neck or chest after a spinal injury could ruin any chance a player has of walking again and could kill them. The time it takes to get medical is also critical in cases of spinal injuries and severe bleeding. Every single second matters and if players are charging over the body even if they don't hit him, they're costing him valuable time that could save him from potentially permanent damage or even death. We all know the Richard Zednik is only alive because of how quickly he received medical attention. Ricardo Lockette the Seahwaks WR who got a spinal injury a year or two ago might have died had anyone run over him during the play. He certainly wouldn't be able to walk like he is now. I don't want to see someone loose their chance to ever walk again, or see someone get severe brain damage due to extreme blood loss or even die because players wanted to \"defend\" them.

Never once had he driven a car to work. He didn't want to spend money on things he didn't need. He had been hit by a car before during one of his bike commutes, but that didn't stop him. He would take out his spare bike and ride off to work the very next day.\n\nHe was no super human, though. He was just an herbalist who worked around the clock seeing sick patients in NYC. In his lifetime, he took only a few handful of sick days and vacations. After his long commute and work day, he would return home all beat and tired.\n\nBut despite all of this, he would spend his days off work fixing things around the house. It was not uncommon to hear the sounds of him sawing wood or hammering nails in our garage on the weekends. Some days he would grab his toolbox and disappear for hours. It never ceased to amaze me, because here I was as a young boy praying to get less homework. And here he was spending almost all of his waking hours working, even when he didn't need to work. And when he's not working or fixing things around the house, he was reading shelves upon shelves of books on how to heal people. I always just thought that he was simply a workaholic.\n\nIt was not until after his passing that I learned that he was much more than that. My family is not the only one who misses him. My neighbors still come up to me today asking about him. When I let them know that he passed away, they would tell me stories about how he helped fix their garage doors or their sink or their toilet for free. Some would tell me how he used to give them free medicine and helped cure them from their illnesses.\n\nThe more I heard stories about him and the older I got, the more I saw his influence around the household. My mother would cook extras of her delicious home-cooked meals and share them with others. I went around my neighborhood helping people fix their computers, printers, and TVs for free. We all had our talents, and we were willing to share them. And I think that's really what we're all here for.\n\nThat man once told me, \"If you have more than you need, build a longer table rather than a taller fence.\"\n\nWords to live by...\n\nIt would have been his birthday this week.\n\nHappy birthday, dad. We all miss you.","score":"1863","subreddit":"movies"}

I don't think he killed himself. why would he think she would even respond, let alone foresee she'd ask him to dinner or give him any sort of opportunity to do that? i think the death in the book was just a culmination of what he felt like after he finished writing it. he expressed his feelings through art by killing his family's killer. and he was either empty after it, with nothing more to feel, or in complete anguish for the immediate future and very possibly beyond.\n","score":"16","subreddit":"movies"}

They have a higher production quality as well as a darker tone which many mistake to mean better in a general sense. Smaller seasons, can be binged watched, dark tone they have a lot of things that are in vogue right now. I myself loved DD S1 and JJ but LC and DD S2 were both weaker in my eyes.\n\nBut I think underneath the admittedly shitty grime of general network television bullshit, I think AoS is better than all of them. The consistent quality despite multiple 20+ seasons, the creation of completely new characters that I've grown to love, the ability to blend humour and wit into stories that can be quite dark and serious despite the \"light and campy\" moniker people throw on the show without thinking too hard about it.\n AoS is such an underrated show in my eyes.

{"body":"A simple direct democracy perhaps, but the people of the enlightenment weren't stupid, and designed these things the way they are for a reason. An important part of western democracies is to **avoid the tyranny of the majority.** You can often predict how people will vote depending on their socio-economic as well as geographic and work situation, so in a large country like the US it important to make sure that different parts of the country that may have fewer people living there, with completely different political wishes, are represented, and don't get their voices drowned out by places that just happen to have larger populations. Areas with less people living there might be just as, if not more important to a society's functioning than cities with large concentrations of people. This is why it's important that they have any chance to affect the outcome of elections, because otherwise these areas, where we know for a fact due to their socio-economic, geographic and work situation they will want to vote differently than people elsewhere, might as well not have a vote at all.

{"body":"I got into K-pop during the SNSD - Gee era which I think was 2009 and I've followed many acts from then until now.  In the beginning I felt a bit like I was a weirdo because I was listening to mostly korean music while everyone else I knew didn't and even made fun of the way the idols looked when they saw what I was interested in.  I've also felt a little strange as I get older and k-pop pulls in younger fans.  It makes me feel like maybe I should have matured out of it? \n\nBut you know what??  I decided that none of that matters.  Nobody else can be inside my head and feel how the music makes me feel.  K-pop gets me moving inside, bopping along, and lifts my mood.  It's the ultimate stress relief.  I'd never regret sticking with k-pop.  As long as it makes me feel good I'll keep following it.  If you're feeling embarrased about liking k-pop then I say just relax and let it happen. \n\nThe only caution I'd give is to keep an open mind.  Don't let the fandom culture limit your exposure to other groups.  Yes, BTS is amazing, but there are so many other great groups out there too.

The reality of the situation is that this is the Neopets we have and will continue to have and JS will prop it up in this state until it makes too much of a loss - at which point, it will be closed.\n\nAll major issues with Neopets currently ultimately come down to a lack of funding for resources. JS does not have money to throw at Neopets and, even if they did, it would be commercial suicide to invest heavily in Neopets - a dead franchise at this point - rather than their other games based on active franchises (School of Dragons being front and centre).

{"body":"Cuando se empezó a señalar el saludo diferente en V de Errejón pensé que no tenía ninguna importancia y que las pequeñas diferencias enriquecían a Podemos. Era la prueba de que en Podemos cada cual puede escoger los signos que más le atraigan. Lo que no sospechaba entonces es que Errejón ya había empezado a crear su propio partido dentro de Podemos. El canal de telegram \"Pueblo, patria, Podemos\", los canales de Jorge Moruno y otro afines y el canal del propio Errejón empezaron poco a poco a difundir consignas que no casaban del todo con la línea oficial de Podemos, como queriendo exhibir su \"V\" en cada tema. Las dimisiones en bloque en Madrid y el posterior silencio autoimpuesto de Errejón fueron la confirmación de que algo iba muy mal. Y en las últimas semanas, los errejonistas, no sólo han difundido información engañosa con unos gráficos impresentables, sino que están utilizando sin pudor a los medios vendidos para atacar a compañeros de Podemos. Yo lo siento de veras pero creo que esa gente sólo se representa a sí misma. Los quiero fuera de los órganos de Podemos cuanto antes y espero y deseo que seamos los inscritos los que los expulsemos de sus cargos de forma democrática. Soy consciente de que hay personas que tienen una visión opuesta a la mía. Desgraciadamente he podido comprobar que no sirve de nada tratar de llegar a un entendimiento con muchos de ellos. Cuando hay posturas tan irreconciliables, sólo se puede resolver el conflicto votando y respetando el resultado.

I remember one girl in sex ed asking 'Is it possible you lose so much blood that it makes you ill?' and the nurse just laughed and said 'Of course not! That's not actually possible!'\n\nBullshit.\n\nI started my periods when I was 15. Right from the beginning, they were insanely heavy and typically lasted for two weeks. They actually became more irregular as I got older; occurring anywhere from once every three weeks to every four months. Each month, I would lose so much blood that I became pale and dizzy. I couldn't stand up without my vision getting dark and my breathing was always shallow. I would need to change an overnight pad every hour. At 16, I switched to a menstrual cup and used the larger size (recommended for women who have given birth) because it held slightly more than the smaller size - even then, I still had to empty it every two or three hours.\n\nAny time I mentioned to female friends 'I think my periods are quite heavy', they'd all say 'Oh same, mine are so heavy too! I have to change a super tampon every four hours! You don't need to worry, _you're just like so many girls_.'\n\nI finally saw a doctor when I was 18 and told her about my periods. She gave me a look of 'What the actual fuck' and essentially told me my periods were completely fucked up. Turns out I was severely anaemic as a result of years of heavy bleeding. Was immediately put on the pill and told to skip as many periods as possible while waiting to see a gynaecologist.\n\nI really think there needs to be a sex ed class where they teach you that, it's possible for periods to not be normal.

But if you were prone to this, I assume you'd already know, having gone through a pregnancy. \n\nGeneral advice for everyone: Find the most experienced provider you can to put your IUD in. If your doctor cites outdated info or admits she doesn't see them much in her practice, go to someone else if you can. The provider's experience level makes a huge difference in outcomes, and in my anecdotal experience, also in how long it takes and how unpleasant it is.

Seriously, do it.\n\n- You see that little hammer icon next to the long list of stuff you can craft when you open your inventory? If you left click that, it'll show you a compacted view of stuff you can craft, and you can just click on one of the items in the compacted view and it'll bring you to that recipe on the list. Makes finding stuff in your inventory take no more than a few seconds no matter how long the list is.\n\n- Additionally, there is a button near your main inventory that allows you to quick sort your inventory - makes finding stuff in there much easier. There are also similar options in the inventory screen of chests, makes sorting things to and from your inventory easier too!\n\n- I can't remember, do they know how hammers work? If you left click physical blocks (not background ones) with a hammer they'll change shape, to stuff like angles and stairs - can be used on platforms too to make into stairs like lewis wanted, and makes roofs really easy. You can make some really cool bases using them, opens up a whole new layer of architectural design!\n\n- the guide really is worth talking to, he essentially acts like the r key in the TooManyItems mod in minecraft. So long as you have a material, he can show you all the things you can make with it. ALL the things.\n\n- You should really never make a golden axe while still wearing stone armor - the focus should really be on armor and weapons (your guys' copper shortswords are the worst in the game, at least upgrade to the wooden broadswords), then pickaxes, then other junk. Axes really don't do enough to be worth crafting til you've got nothing better to do with your materials.\n\n- Did I mention you should buy rope from the merchant and replace the platforms in the hellevator with it?\n\n- Investing in a potion stand and health potions is a pretty good idea - grab some sand, make it into glass at a furnace, make the glass into bottles there too, then plonk a bottle on a worktable to make an alchemy station. Then all you need is 1 mushroom, 2 gel and an empty bottle to make a lesser health potion that restores 50 health. They can also be upgraded to regular health potions (100 healing) with a glowing mushroom at an alchemy station, which you get from the underground mushroom biome (the place with all the glowing blue shrooms).\n\n- It's worthwhile grabbing any stars you see that fall at night - three of them can be turned into a mana crystal to increase your mana. You won't have too much in the way of magic items for a while yet, but worth planning ahead. Be aware that stars vanish in the morning, even if you drop them from your inventory!\n\n- Finally, you should probably consider replacing the platforms in the hellevator with rope, which can conveniently be purchased from the merchant :p\n\n","score":"22","subreddit":"Yogscast"}

{"body":"Experience eventually trumped youth today (fun fact: Bayern fielded it's oldest starting XI this season today). The early Thiago goal kicked things off well, and Leipzig just fell apart there. An amateur mistake by Keita and a penalty simply gifted the points to us.\n\nnbsp;\n\nDefence didn't have much to do today, but Hummels was a standout performer, making occasional good passes behind the Leipzig high-line for Lewandowski, who in one instance almost managed to chip the ball over the keeper, but was unfortunately deflected above the bar. Alaba and Bernat both did exceedingly well at LB, with dangerous 1-2s with Costa and Ribery respectively.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nMidfield really won it for us today. Alonso was solid a lot of the time, and the only time he was caught out Selke didn't manage to pick out Burke in time, which fizzled out the attack instantly. He also managed to get a goal (inside the box!!!!) from Keita's horrendous error. Vidal was the ball-winning midfielder, breaking up the typically fast passing and running game that Leipzig employs. He is in fact one of the main reasons why Leipzig didn't manage to trouble Neuer much at all tonight. Thiago shone once more in his impressive start to the season, first getting a goal, and coordinating the attacking midfield well. He can really give Müller quite a run for his money to get a place in the starting XI.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nRobben was sufficiently good in the first half, causing troubles in the Leipzig back-line, and passes exchanged with Lahm on the right-wing set up the first goal. Withdrawn at half-time to rest him due to fitness issues last weekend. Lewandowski got on the scoresheet today from the spot, but a pretty average performance from him, who really have to work on his chance conversion and setting up his teammates (many a times he wasted chances by not squaring the ball in time, or just shooting when there were better options). Ribery, who came on for Robben, gave Leipzig a bad time in the 2nd half, but ultimately got nothing out of it, despite his near goal off the crossbar. Costa was the MOTM today for me, with his explosive pace and exquisite skills which tore the Leipzig backline to shreds. Deserved a goal, but couldn't get one.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nOverall, the first half was a joy to behold, with a combination of brilliance from Costa and Leipzig's apparent stage-fright throwing us into a 3-0 lead. The second half was however lacking the creativity and perhaps determination that they had in the first, which let Leipzig off the hook from a worse scoreline. The game could have ended much differently had Leipzig struck first. Ultimately, the lack of experience and perhaps awe of playing against such a big club in such a stadium let to Leipzig's downfall today. The foul by Forsberg against Lahm was very cynical and certainly deserved the send-off, which just threw Leipzig off their game. Too many times we could see players like Poulsen lose their temper and get frustrated whenever they lost the ball, and that's something they would have to work on as a team to continue posing a challenge for the title. Hassenhuttl, and Leipzig, would certainly learn from this and grow as a team, and Bayern would be happy to take 3 points and the autumn championship tonight.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nWorst player: Forberg - threw his team's chance to win the match tonight away with a cynical foul on our captain\n\nBest player: Costa - too hot to handle for the Leipzig backline\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nP.S.

{"body":"I experienced many of the same things as you when I first started frequenting stores. People wouldn't look at me, conversations died out quickly, and people just generally seemed uninterested in anything other than playing.\n\nAs many others have pointed out, this is probably due to the demographic of magic players. There is a high percentage of us that just aren't very social.\n\nEventually, though, I think I cracked some kind of code. First of all, I think many players are a bit reserved, shy and maybe insecure. That means that it will take time before they warm to people and open up. After becoming a semi-regular at my store, many guys that I previously thought to be arrogant and uninterested have proven to be really nice people.\n\nThe other thing that I needed to understand, was that for most people hanging out at an LGS, the main topic of conversation will always be MTG and nothing else. To begin with, I always tried to strike up conversation about everyday stuff like work, other hobbies, sports, news, etc., but that never worked out. If you just drop all the 'normal' conversational topics and instead focus on magic-related things, you might find that people will be more likely to enjoy talking to you.\n\nAnd last but not least, I think my own prejudices contributed towards me having trouble functioning at my LGS. I never considered myself a \"fulltime geek\" like the other people there, and maybe that made me arrogant and indifferent towards them. Like, \"We're here to play magic, but I'd rather talk about everything else.\"\n\nI've really started to enjoy playing at my LGS, so I hope that you will experience the same.\n\nTL;DR: Magic players often think, breathe and eat magic all day long, so magic is likely to the only topic for conversation and interaction. Many people are also shy, so you should give them time to warm to you and not give up after one negative experience at the store.\n\n","score":"34","subreddit":"magicTCG"}

{"body":"Frankly, Im enjoying standard. The downsides are quite obviously copter and emrakul though.\n\nPutting such powerful cards in colorless is a huge balance issue. Sure it means no single color is busted by them, but it makes them far too common. Thopter would be okay, because it's strong but not oppressive. Emrakul on the other hand can single handedly turn a losing game into a win.  \n\nPersonally, I think if we didnt have emrakul or copter the format would look much the same as it does. Delirium would be running around like crazy, u/w midrange would be right behind it just without copter. And aethrworks would be less consistent as they would need to always hit ulamog or bust. But if not for copter, the rest of the format would be substantially weaker than the current big 3. B/r aggro/madness would be far worse, vehicles wouldnt exist. Rg/x energy decks would be substantially better. But thats about it.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of the actual feel bad getting mindslavered actually is.\n\nThat said. I take all of this over JTMS, bitterblossom, thoughtseize, blightning, snapcaster/mana leak, and packrat.\n\nLike any oppressive cards in standard it's once agaim, the tools to solve the problem dont exist. Red has virtually no artifact removal, no color has any graveyard hate, emrakul is on a cast trigger so summary dismissal is the only proper answer, and Gideon is arguably the 3rd most powerful planeswalker ever printed able to crush anyone looking to run creatures into each other. \n\nProbably the worst thing is how close this standard is to being great.

This isn't like the Amiibo brand where they had intentions of keeping it rolling indefinitely.\n\nThe Amiibo problem wasn't even the (exact) same issue.\n\nNintendo was stepping into 'toys to life' with two heavy competitors already in the market and no data. They were very open that there was simply no way to produce all figures at the same time in equal numbers. Obscure characters like Wii Fit Trainer were stocked in lower ratios to characters like Mario or Pikachu. Rather than buying characters they liked, like the optional plastic DLC it is, fans were inspired to *collect them all*. And not just one copy, either. These fans wanted one to open, one to keep boxed, one to customize. Suddenly sales estimates are off by as much as a third.\n\n...All during a port strike, meaning even the stuff they had wasn't making it to shelves.\n\n*Then* people started buying these things up like they were valuables, while the bubble was just waiting to burst.\n\nAnd now that people have wised up, scalping has cleared, the Smash Bros. set is (almost) finished being released people complain that the market \"cooled\" -- no, it's where it's supposed to be.","score":"16","subreddit":"nintendo"}

I am not insinuating that Donny is a child rapist or that Clinton, Podesta, whoever else over at the DNC is a fucking angel. I am making extremely hyperbolic hypothetical claims to illustrate a point.\n\n\nLet's say (R)on and (D)erek are running for President. I hack both of them and find some shadynasty stuff, say, like **both of them are homosexual pedophiles who have raped young boys and kept video that shows them in the act**. This is utterly disqualifying, and if these videos came to light, they would pretty much instantaneously lose all but their most uninformed support and go to jail on top of it.\n\n\nAgain, **both of these guys are guilty of the same crime** and I have evidence that will fry both of them. However, I only release (D)erek's video. Boom, everyone knows he's a pedophile, his shot at winning the election explodes into dust, and (R)on is pretty much swept in by default. But remember, **(R)on is a pedophile rapist too** and I'm simply not letting anyone know. Instead, I'm going to dangle the knowledge that I know over his head and blackmail him into doing whatever I want.\n\n\nIt's about influencing opinion. Hell, let's imagine that both (R)on and (D)erek aren't guilty of anything. They are both absolute saints with differing views on what direction to take a country, but are swell guys regardless. I hack (D)erek. It's not that I can't hack (R)on--I can hack anyone, I just choose to hack (D)erek today. I find nothing even remotely incriminating to any sensible or informed person. The problem is that the voters aren't sensible or informed, so when I announce **(D)EREK WAS HACKED! POOR INFORMATION SECURITY!**, it gives the impression that (D)erek's camp is worse at IT than (R)on. That's not the case, I just *chose* not to hack (R)on. And if I really want (D)erek to lose, I can start going through the absolute nothing I got from the hack and making up crazy stories about it. *Someone* is going to believe them. \n\n\nThere are going to be more people willing to think (D)erek is a monster based on either his \"poor information security\" or whatever nonsense conclusions I draw from his innocuous emails--say, the fact that he evidently likes to eat pasta a lot must mean he's running a child sex brothel out of an Italian restaurant--and are now willing to vote against him or at least not *for* him than there are people who will see that this hack was targeted or that the conspiracies coming out of it are unfounded lies and are now more willing to vote *for* him or against his opponent for whatever reason, say, \"Well, if someone's trying this hard to sabotage him, he must be good.\"\n\n\nThe selective targeting of individuals or leaking of information can be used to misinform and prejudice voters.

( 7 with combat experience, the seal has extensive combat experience and is our leader and teacher )\nWe formed almost 5 years ago and we practice every week for 16 hours on the weekends. We are properly equipped and are highly trained, and 100% loyal to President Trump. There is an entire network of like minded groups in the northeast that have had detailed and consistent communication and plans regarding any situation that threatens the country - foreign or domestic.\n\nWe may be citizen soldiers but the SEAL has turned us into true warriors. When we first started many of us were out of shape and lethargic. Many were gamers in poor health. Three are mothers concerned about the future of their kids and country. Our military members taught us how to eat right, work out properly, think on our toes, and have trained us in numerous weapon systems, tactics, first aid, etc. Trained in every season the northeast gives us. They also are in constant contact with their military buddies and President Trump has nearly universal support. They covertly tell them that if forced to choose, they would back President Trump with any force required.\n\nIf the liberals try to do anything, we will be ready. All of us will. I think people will be VERY shocked at what comes out of the backwoods in our more rural counties in this country. The gun ranges are placed there for a reason after all. :-)\nOur patriot group is within 15 min of 5 substations, and 3 national guard armories. We know which police departments are against us, for us, or on the fence. \n\nThe left and many people make the incorrect assumption that militias are made up of \"hicks\" and are unprofessional. They will be in for quite a shock if they try to steal the office.\nEveryone here is on our highest alert we have that is in peacetime. We thought Hillary was going to steal the election and we were all geared up and ready to go. But Trump won rightfully so and we stood down. We now fear that they will fabricate bullshit to try to force a new election.\n\nListen carefully, Democrats. If you try this, it will be the biggest mistake you have ever made.

{"body":"I took Flygon to the London International Challenge. He does have a niche when Garchomp exists, but it's very specific. \n\nIf you want a dragon that hits physically, especially with Earthquake and Dragon Claw, Garchomp is your choice 100% of the time. However, if your team is super weak to EQ, Flygon can act as a switch-in with Levitate.\n\nMy team for London had Tapu Bulu because I was using both Arcanine and Togedemaru, making me weak to Earthquake. However, to cover the rest of the weaknesses of my team, I really needed a Dragon/Ground type. Grassy Terrain weakens EQ damage, that's why I had Tapu Bulu in the first place. I really needed ground coverage to hit the many electric types I had no way to beat. That's where I looked at Earth Power users. Flygon was something that fit all of the following problems:\n\n* Defensive typing\n* Ground coverage that wasn't EQ\n* Team was weak to EQ\n* Team was weak to Garchomp\n\nUsing a Choice Scarf special set allowed me to outspeed and OHKO most Garchomp variants with Draco, the only ones I couldn't beat were Scarf and the AV Chomps I didn't expect at all and lost the tournament to. I could outspeed and OHKO Tapu Koko and had a % chance to OHKO Marowak-A and Kartana with Earth Power.\n\nDespite Flygon's reputation for being just a bad version of Chomp, it was actually one of the more reliable members of my team. It was able to net me some key KO's and was a big player in most of my wins. If the Garchomps I ran into were not AV variants, I would have done significantly better, and Flygon would have been my ticket to day 2.\n\nWhile under most circumstances, Garchomp is always better, there are a few cases where Flygon is the more effective choice. My team was one of those times, and the biggest reason for that was that Garchomp only gets Earth Power by ORAS Move Tutor, while Flygon gets it legally. Being able to work around Grassy Terrain without anti-synergy was major, and only Flygon could do all of the things I wanted.","score":"21","subreddit":"stunfisk"}

{"body":"My adoptive parents sent me to a camp in Utah for kids with reactive attachment disorder. They sent me after a friend and I tried to run away, which meant we left a poorly forged note saying we had been kidnapped and tried to hitch a ride out of town. I don't remember being transported and I never tried to run away from camp because it was surrounded by nothing but dirt and snakes. You had all privileges stripped at admission. We mostly cleaned barns and got platitudes yelled at us. When you first arrived you started by sitting in a circle all day, every day. I was an expert at playing the system and doing whatever I had to in order to graduate (aka escape) so I moved quickly. There were girls there that hadn't been home in a year and if you didn't move up, they could keep you until you turned 18 or your parents stopped paying. I have no idea how any of them stood it that long unless going home was really that much worse...for some of us it was. \n\n\nDespite graduating I never went home, they had a set of unlicensed foster parents from Colorado pick me up. I learned a lot from camp, mostly how to stand there being cold for hours, how to smoke a cigarette in less than a minute and how to steal. Oh, and how to make a bed.

He wasn't pleased with this workaround solution and proceeded to inform me that it would interrupt the flow of his work because now he would have to walk to the other side of the building (30 second walk) to retrieve the print job and *it was just easier to print the email attachment he received at his desk so he could just scan and send it* to the next person in the chain of command. \n\nDuring the explanation, I stopped him and asked him why he was printing an attachment again, not being sure if I heard him correctly. It turns out, I did hear him right, and he was printing email attachments, scanning them with his desktop scanner to use the 'Scan to Email' function, and sending the received attachments repeatedly by following this procedure. \n\nUpon hearing this, I introduced him the the Forward Email functionality of his email client and called it quits.

I guess I could compare it to North American textbooks including the Battle of the Somme in WWI. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings are given much more attention, and like how WW2 is basically an entire genre of movie in the west, you could classify movies about these bombings as their own kind of genre. The narratives don't blame Americans, they're just about the horrors of war and regular people trying to survive.\n\nI think Pearl Harbour was mentioned because it is a major event for Americans, but there are tons of \"actual\" atrocities (not to diminish the tragedy of that loss of life) that the Imperial army committed that will never be in the textbooks. People have mentioned the Rape of Nanking and Unit 731. Japan is also criticized by neighbouring Asian countries for the abuse of \"comfort women\", who were women taken without consent from Imperial-occupied areas and made to be sex dolls for the soldiers (they claim to have learned this from Americans). \n\nThe thing is that the Japanese government has never apologized for these events, and this is a large part of why China and Korea hate on Japan. This and Yasukuni shrine. Hoo boy this turned into a longer post than i expected.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention why I mentioned being zainichi.

I haven't watched a ton of her show (don't have cable), but I *did* see the \"Twelve Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\" episode and thought it was a brilliant satire of the double standard that men and women face in entertainment (to whit: ugly men are allowed to be famous as comics, while women are only allowed to be famous if they're pretty, regardless of what they're trying to be famous for).

{"body":"Not a teacher, but I had one who recently got arrested for a sexual relationship with a minor student. None of this was surprising to my friends and I. This teacher was notorious for hanging out with her students on the weekends, gossiping about students, and bullying them as well. Basically she acted like she was an immature high schooler herself and not a mature adult. Personally I never liked her because we had some beef in previous years which resulted in her blocking me on all social media and talking shit behind my back. Eventually it was found out that she sent nudes and gave a student oral over the course of about three months. He was a grade ahead of me and I only knew him through other friends and social media. She was arrested in her classroom and I saw the cop cars pull up to the school. This story ended up going viral so I wouldn't be surprised if anyone here has heard it before. I've included an article for proof. Google her name and you'll find lots more. Her husband (yes she's unfortunately married) paid her bail and I have no idea what she's up to now.

{"body":"I appreciate your question, and it's a question I get quite often. As much as people want to think of the world as black and white; right and wrong, do or don't, it's much more nuanced than that. The best way I can describe it is a steady succession of bad choices over a period of time, brought on by life events. I am of the firm belief that an individual is born an addict. Your brain is just waiting for the right stimulant to manifest the addiction. For a lot of people, it's alcohol. Others, it's stimulants. The first time I tried opioids was when I was fifteen (I'm twenty-two now). In American Psycho, Brett Easton Ellis writes a line that truly defines addiction for me. He writes, \"Relief washes over me like an awesome wave\". When I took opiates, from the moment I first felt the effects, I knew they would ultimately be a problem.\n\n\nSo, trying them sporadically over the next few years, I first started abusing them after a four-year relationship ended. You tell yourself, \"Oh I'll just buy some for tomorrow and then I'll wait a week\". That turns into, \"I'll do pills, but I'll never try heroin; that's for junkies. I'm above that. I'm refined.\" Which turns into, \"Well Heroin is so much cheaper than pills, so I'll buy that. But I'll only smoke it. Shooting it in your veins is for the hardcore users. I'm above that. I'm refined.\" Which turns into, \"Well I can sit there and smoke $20 worth of heroin in one sitting, or I can shoot $5 worth into my veins, and piece it out four times.\" I'll tell you right now. The high from putting junk in your veins compared to even smoking it is absolutely incomparable. You know the beginning scene of Trainspotting when Renton has the tie around his arm, cigarette dangling out of his mouth, and his eyes are rolled into the back of his skull? He says, \"Take the best orgasm you've ever had, multiply it by a thousand, and you're still no where near the feel of a hit in your veins.\" That's the best description I could ever hope to actualize.\n\n\nNo one will ever understand the things that we users will do in order to get our next hit. Being dope sick is literally the worst pain I have ever been in in my entire life. When people think of pain, they think of acute, and visceral pain. Being dope sick is acutely painful, as well as having a psychological skull-fuck on the user. The feeling of sitting by my phone, waiting for my dealer to wake the fuck up from his inevitable hit-inducing four-hour coma; having a text come in from someone who is not your d-boy (the ONLY person you want anything to do with in the entire world at that moment) and screaming at your phone, launching it across your room. The feeling of your dealer saying that he'll be at the spot in ten minutes, and him not showing up for a fucking hour, while you sit in your car slamming your hands against the steering wheel, skin crawling and sweat drip down your brow.\n\n\nIt's indescribable. But hey. When you get that hit in you, it's all worth it. It's like you learned nothing from the past four hours. From the past week. From the past however-long. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, and expecting different results; somehow thinking that the experience will be different from the last.\n\n\nI wouldn't wish addiction on my worst enemy. I hope that explanation at least scratches the surface","score":"190","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

Throughout the month we do various repairs and deal with disputes, but it's minor enough that my husband - who does the bulk of the repairs - can work a full time job and I'm a stay at home mom so I just take care of the other stuff.  It's pretty minimal and the free rent is basically like getting an extra $1500 every month.  We also live in a highly coveted neighborhood in a very coveted city, so it's definitely worth it for about 2 or 3 hours of work per week.\n\nEDIT: Just to clear up any confusion we do NOT own our buildings, we just manage them.","score":"99","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"From /u/Senior_Chang\n\nSo there's this kid named Billy. And Billy's a normal kid, right? Except he loves trolleys. Really loves trolleys. Loves trolleys more than is appropriate, it is kind of weird. But whatever, point is, he likes trolleys. In kindergarten all he did was play with trolleys. He made no friends. But he didn't care, he had trolleys. He brought in his favorite trolley for show and tell in second grade. One of the other kids took it from him to tease him. Now, Billy did not like this at all. Billy was angry. He got this crazed look in his eyes. Something bad was going to happen. And it did. Billy started wailing on this kid, throwing arms and kicks at him. His parents had to be called in and they had to placed in separate classes. \n\nThroughout his school career, Billy is known as that kid who likes trolleys. In high school, he starts this trolley club. He's the only member, because nobody else wanted to be in it or even liked trolleys as much as Billy. Time went by and Billy was senior in high school.  He decided that he wanted to go big- he wanted to be a trolley conductor in San Francisco, that was his dream job. He enrolled in a nice, small college out in Montana. At this point, Billy has decided he is an adult now, and he should go by Bill. So, Bill goes to college. It's a nice place and he has a good time. He learns French, German, calculus, but most importantly, everything he needs to know about trolleys and then some. Bill graduates top of his class.\n\nBill is ready for the big time. San Francisco. But he doesn't quite have the money yet, so he works at the local Wal-Mart for 2 years. It's awful. His manager is always on drugs and can't handle the store at all. But Bill is tough about it. He gets his work done knowing that trolleys are in his future. At this point, he has the money. He's going to San Francisco.\n\nBill moves out to San Francisco and immediately applies at the trolley company. His credentials seem alright, so he is called in for an interview. At the interview, Bill's passion is clear. He loooooves trolleys. He is hired on the spot. \nBill comes to his first day of work shortly thereafter. He loves it! This is the life he wanted. The passengers love him, too, as do his coworkers. The trolley is the best thing to ever happen in his life. A few weeks go by, and all is great! Bill loves his job, trolleys are the best. \n\nBut this can't stay forever. One day, Bill is driving the trolley downtown. He loves this, trolleys are the best! He approached the intersection of 13th and Apple Boulevard and there seems to be a commotion! A new restaurant was opening. A large group of people starts to cross the street in front of Bill. Bill stares at them. Something happens in his mind. That look in his eyes that he had when he beat the kid in first grade reemerges. He's doing something bad. And he did. He drove the trolley through the crowd and killed 9(!) people and injured many more. This was awful.. This was bad..\n\nBill goes to jail for this. He has a trial. Unfortunately the verdict turns out bad for him. He is getting the death penalty. Bill weeps. He ruined it! He had his life perfect, and he ruined it! He couldn't return to the trolley anymore.. The day approaches for the execution. Bill is going to get the electric chair. Bill is asked what he would like for his last meal. He thinks for a while and says, \"I would like a steak.. A nice big one. Medium rare please. A baked potato.. No wait, make that 2 baked potatoes.. and... 2 blue apples. Yes, blue apples.\" Now of course, you ask what are blue apples? The prison staff had to ask him. They are apparently a very rare kind of apple only found in South America. \n\nIt was the night before the big day and Bill was served his last meal. The steak was cooked to perfection, the potatoes were okay, but most importantly were the blue apples. They had been given to Bill. Bill loved them. They were delicious. The only thing he like more were trolleys. And he loved trolleys. Now it was the day. Bill was going to be put in the electric chair. The executioner asked if he had any last words. Bill replied, \"Yeah, I'll say a few.. Just tell my parents I love them and that I'm sorry.. And I really love trolleys.\"\n\nThe executioner went and turned on the power to the chair. He let it stay on for the normal amount and shut the chair off. But Bill was still alive. Perfectly fine, except maybe an elevated heart rate, but he was alive. Bill was alive. The executioner was shocked. He had never seen this before! Because the chair didn't work they let him go. Bill was alive and well.\n\nBill at this point knew he couldn't get a job at the trolley company again. He decided to move to the east coast. He looked around and settled on Boston. Looking for jobs, Bill finds openings with the city bus company. He applied for a job. Now, times were tough for the bus company. People now just don't want to drive buses. They were severely understaffed. Bill was given a chance and called in for an interview. He was clearly passionate and seemed very well learned. He was hired.\n\nBill liked this job. It wasn't quite a trolley, but it was still good. His first day was splendid. Passengers loved him and he enjoyed driving. A few weeks went by. A month went by. It was all going great. Football season came. Bill was driving the bus on a Sunday. There were large crowds of people in town for the game and Bill was losing his patience. At the corner of 13th and Main Street, he was stopped at a stoplight. A crowd of people crossed the street. Bill lost his mind. His brows furrowed and he got that look in his eyes again. Just like in first grade, just like in San Francisco. He floored it into the crowd and killed 7(!) people, injuring many more. This was bad. This was awful.\n\nBill went to jail again. He had another trial and was once again given the death penalty. Bill wept. He had again thrown his life away. The day approached, and once again Bill was scheduled for the electric chair. He was asked if he had last meal requests. “Yes,” he said, “I would like some pizza, pepperoni please. A breadstick. No, make that 2 breadsticks. And 2 blue apples.” Again they had to ask about the blue apples. They are very rare, from South America.\n\nThe night before the execution, Bill had his last meal. The pizza was good, the breadsticks were okay, but the blue apples. They were delicious. Bill enjoyed this meal and the blue apples. Now it was the day. Bill was going to be put in the electric chair. Bill was asked if he had any last words. Bill replied, \"Yeah, I'll say a few.. Just tell my parents I love them and that I'm sorry.. And I really love trolleys.\"\n\nThe executioner went and turned on the power to the chair. He let it stay on for a while and shut the chair off. But Bill was still alive. Perfectly fine, except maybe an elevated heart rate, but he was alive. Bill was alive. The executioner was shocked. He had never seen this before! Because the chair didn't work they let him go. Bill was alive and well.\n\nAt this point, Bill knew he could never get a job in the United States again. He was going to go to Europe. He had learned French and German in college, so he decided upon Germany. It would be a good place. He adopted a fake identity, Terry Matthews. He reinvented himself. Terry was a new man, a changed man. He settled down in Germany and rented an apartment. Terry, as I'll call him now, looked for a job. He was shocked to find a trolley company in the city! He couldn't pass this up. He applied. Terry was called in for the interview. His passion was clear. He loved trolleys. He also spoke German and English, which was a bonus for dealing with tourists. And even French! Terry was hired on the spot. \n\nTerry loved trolleys. He reminisced of the first days in San Francisco. This was his dream job. The first day on the job went fantastic! The passengers loved him and he loved his job. A few weeks went by. A few months go by. A year goes by. 2 years go by. Terry loves his job. One day, Terry is driving the trolley around town. It's a big day! Germany is playing an international friendly soccer match and it is the height of tourist season. Lots of people are in town. He is in the trolley when he sees a large group of people crossing the street. Terry suddenly becomes enraged. He gets the look in his eyes again. He drives into the crowd and kills 13(!) this time.. This is bad. This is awful.\n\nTerry goes to prison. He has a trial. At this point, the judge knows that this isn't Terry Matthews. This is Bill, the trolley conductor from America who killed 16 people there and now 13 in Germany. He is given the death penalty. He will be executed by electric chair.\n\nThe day approaches and Bill is asked for a last meal request. He thinks about it and said, “I haven't had American food in a while. How about a cheeseburger. Some fries. And two blue apples.” The prison staff here knew about blue apples. The local world food market sold them. They were from South America and very rare. The day is tomorrow and Bill has his last meal. The burger was okay, not as good as he was hoping, and the fries were good, but the blue apples. They were delicious! Just like he remembered.\n\nFinally, it was the day. Bill was going to the electric chair. He was asked for last words. “Just a few,” he said. “I want to say I'm sorry. I don't know what took hold of me... And I really love trolleys.” With that, the executioner turns the power on. It's really going. The chair sizzles and the executioner waits. Finally, he turns it off. But Bill is still alive!!! How!?! The executioner is shocked. His heart was a little fast from the nerves, but other than that, perfectly fine! The executioner was astounded.\n\nHe had to ask.. “Bill.. I must know. You survived twice in America. And now once here! How?! How did you do this!?”\n\nBill thought for a moment and said, “I guess I'm just a bad conductor.”","score":"1085","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"When I was in high school I got into theater. It started out with my friends being in Macbeth, then I started building the sets and doing other back stage tech work. The theater teacher was openly homosexual and the principle didn't care for him. That teacher quit due to stress which led to us having a long term sub and then this new guy. I had started auditioning and was getting bigger roles in the plays every semester. This guy who replaced the sub and original teacher was a total creep. There were these wild rumors going around that he was cheating on his wife with one of the students. His wife would call up some of the students and question them about if they knew anything. If the wife is that scared then something is going on. We also saw a lot of fairly blatant sexual tension between him and the student. He would also give her the lead role in everything she auditioned for. We hated this guy. He would never spend any money on productions and things just weren't adding up. We knew how much money the previous plays had made because the older teachers were more transparent. We started doing crappy plays with free scripts, and not spending any money on new set pieces but just reusing old ones. He was probably pocketing the money. I got cast as the lead male role in the Bride of Frankenstein. The student he had the secret relationship with was the bride of Frankenstein. He wouldn't ever give direction in what we should do and always seemed preoccupied with the lighting instead of what the actors were doing. We were choreographing all the scenes ourselves without a chosen leader. All signs pointed toward the show being a big fat failure and I didn't want to be the guy up on stage in the lead role being embarrassed. I straight up quit. Part of me quit because I knew he did not expect anyone of the students to have the balls to do it. I called his bluff and it felt great. My understudy took over the role and he wasn't that great of a fit. My fellow cast members were pretty frustrated with me but I think they should have had the guts to do the same. This was a couple months before graduation and I just left theater and started playing more guitar. I joined a band I played with for a few months and went off to college. After a year at college I went out for a drink with the student who had the supposed relationship with the teacher. By her own account it turns out they actually did have a relationship. They considered each other boyfriend/girlfriend for a while. The teacher had 2 daughters aged 2 and 4. He really was a piece of shit. He ended up getting fired and the theater program was completely shut down a year after I graduated. I think it had something to do with him stealing money and the productions being failures.","score":"147","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

(Big main street in Denver) Eventually we hit a red light together, and I started waving a baseball bat out the window at him, while he, a tire iron towards me.\n\nProblem was that a cop was watching us from across the street, and shone his lights on us, which spooked him, and in turn spooked me, so we both took off form the red light. He was in the left turning lane, and I was in the straight lane, but we both ended up taking left turns, causing the cop to peel out after us.\n\nThe guy in the left lane had the advantage in speed, it was a pick up versus a mini van, so he pulled away first, and left the cops right behind me. I knew there was no out running the cops, so I pulled to the side of the road, while the cop pulled up next to me.\n\nThe cop pulled over next to me, and was going to let his buddy out while the driver went after the other car, I saw this as my only opportunity to get rid of both of them. So with fear in my voice, I yelled to the cops as soon as the passenger door was open. \n\n\"He was pointing a gun at me! GO GO GO!\"\n\nThey didn't even bat an eye, the passenger closed his door and they hauled ass towards the pickup truck who was only a few blocks away.

Only took them a few minutes after that to realize they had been had, so they let the truck driver leave, while they doubled back trying to find me. \n\nHonestly, I was super in the wrong, I shouldn't of been doing what I was doing, and I would probably still be paying off the consequences of those actions had I not thought to try something.\n\nTL;DR: Told cops other guy had a gun and used the distraction to escape from the cops.","score":"16","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"Just recently went through something like this with my uncle over the summer. He died from a heroin overdose in his bed. The point of no return happened when my aunt moved in with him after my grandfather passed away and gave the house to him. They were both hoarder-types, into drugs, and severely obese. I don't know how you can treat yourself any worse. We distanced ourselves from them because things were going south very quickly and my dad didn't want us to see what was happening. \n\nMy uncle weighed over 600lbs when he passed and it required 6 firemen to get him out of the house. His mattress was soiled and flattened to the floor with no box spring or anything. The police told us to make sure we wore thick boots and pants and watched where we stepped in case there were any leftover needles laying around that they didn't find. \n\nEvery single room was stacked head-high with random shit. My dad and I went through everything over the course of a week and found anything of value we could. The only things we actually kept were some pieces of jewelry and a 200 gallon glass fish tank that was in the basement, infested with Black mold. Had to wear masks to get it out of the house and clean it. I'm gonna go through each room individually because they were all unique.\n\nThe living room was stacked with boxes, head high, filled with random crap that you would find at the dollar store. I'm not sure why anyone would buy bulk shit from a dollar store. Tons of random cheap toys and items that have obscure uses. The couch was drenched in dog piss and that was where the dog made it's home. The dog's area was probably one of the cleanest parts in the house. \n\nThe kitchen had no counter or cupboard space left. It was filled with both washed and unwashed dishes. There was even shit stored in the oven. There was almost no food in the fridge that wasn't past the expiration date. There was a large hole in one of the cupboards where it was very apparent that Raccoons were coming in and doing whatever the hell they wanted.\n\nThe basement was mostly empty surprisingly. The floor was covered in garbage, and there were a few boxes here and there. There had been a flood and the basement was just simply abandoned after that, left to soil. Everything was covered in Black mold. We had to wear masks to go down there, and honestly I'm not sure we wore appropriate protection. I probably have cancer or something growing in me right now because of it and don't even know it. \n\nMy aunts room was also attached to the bathroom. There was no door on the bathroom. Everything was covered in a film. What was supposed to be white was yellow and brown. There was even mold on their tooth brushes. The toilet looked like it was never cleaned in years. Her bedroom floor was covered in dirty clothes. Stacks of random clothing items chest high in some spots. There was a pile of dirty feminine products overflowing from a trash bag in the corner. I had to leave the house and fight the urge to vomit for a few minutes after discovering that one.\n\nMy uncles room was bizzare. It was also covered in dirty clothing, but the dog pissed all over everything in there because the dog was bonded to him. As I said before, the mattress was straight on the floor with no box spring or frame. It was flattened like a pancake to the floor. His night stand was where the majority of the drug items were. The police confiscated everything there except a few bongs that were never cleaned. The weirdest thing was that there were boxes and boxes of ammunition laying everywhere. Mostly shotgun slugs, but also .308 rounds and 9mm rounds. My dad is a little bit of a gun enthusiast so we kept this.\n\nThe worst part was the smell. We spent a whole week in what smelled like a thick mixture between wet dog, piss, shit, mold, and sulfur. I got used to it over the course of the week and every time I stepped outside, the air smelled like perfume it was so fresh.\n\nMy then aunt passed away 2 months ago from complications after knee surgery. She also weighed about 600lbs. We left most of the crap in the house that we couldn't find a use for. They will be bulldozing the lot soon because the building is unsellable.\n\nTL;DR : Uncle inherited grandpas house, aunt moved in with him. Both hoarder types and incredibly unhealthy people. Uncle passed away and left a massive mess behind. ","score":"16","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

There's some zombie outbreak and the military stops trying to help and just starts killing everyone. Then they set up quarantine zones and become their own dictatorships.\n\nThe truth is that while this could happen, the movies like to depict this happening in every circumstance without fail. As if the only thing keeping the military from becoming a tyrannical faction are the politicians, and we know that's not true because politicians are almost completely impotent. \n\nNot to mention that the military isn't made up of mindless drones. They're your friends and neighbors. They're not exactly motivated to genocide their own friends and family just because they're told to. In historical examples where a military has risen up to overthrow and oppress their own people it usually coincides with some distinct cultural or ethnic divide between the military and the people who are oppressed, but that wouldn't be the agenda in the event of a world-wide cataclysm. \n\nI will give credit to the video game *The Last of Us* (SPOILERS AHEAD) because it clearly shows the military actually trying to do their job and keep things in order. In the beginning of the game you assume the military is the antagonist, and that the Fireflies are the good guys.

Sure they could make one big ass update, add dozens of stuff we always asked for and it'd feel like a damn new game, but that'd be all there's left for this game.\n\nAs an economics enthusiast I can see their strategy with the game. While we hate them because shark cards and they don't care enough, you need to understand that, as a company, they *need* to make money. Without shark cards and overpriced stuff they'd have to allocate even bigger budgets in the maintenance of the game, which would cause them to be forced to cut the budgets in future games/updates. \n\nWhile GTA VI is also greatly anticipated, I don't see it coming for at least 2 years from now. GTA V/Online is still their most active game currently, and it'd have to fall from its glory for a new game to be in order. Besides, they will have to make the next game be their best work so far - with graphics and animations and models, and I'd rather wait 3 years than to have a rushed out game that feels hardly any different than GTA V.\n\nJust my two cents.","score":"16","subreddit":"gtaonline"}

Yeah, OK, once in a while I would want to reach out (I was young, male, and horny), and I hadn't developed the social skills to help me do that.

{"body":"Players were being knocked over and shoved before this incident, Zlatan destroyed someone after 10 minutes wasn't it? It was a physical match. There was a short spell after the coming together where it was heated and it died down. In general though it was quite a physical game. Rondon was involved in a lot of this. \n\nYes, a slap/anything to do with the face warrants a red by the rules. I don't necessarily get furious with refs when they are slightly lenient with this. Zlatan grabbed someone by the throat a few weeks back and the ref was sensible about it. It doesn't always have to be a red and generally refs book the two players involved as 99 times out of 100 they are both resonsible. There is also the possibility that the ref didn't see it and can't act on the reaction of opposition players. To him it may have looked like two players squaring up and pushing each other, warranting two yellow cards. Which I still think ended up being a good call to keep the game from exploding.\n\nIn my opinion he managed the game correctly and prevented players from being sent off. Refs who live by the laws but apply some common sense are what I like to see.\n\nThough this is my opinion you don't have to agree, not sure it warrants the dramatic \"I mean, wow\" crap however","score":"-9","subreddit":"reddevils"}

Your training will be on the job, and you will learn and be expected to learn everything from cashier, to accepting calls and to mopping the floor. \n\nAnother thing to note is that before you clock in and start work, youre required to copy down the daily work schedule and some other stuff. Eg. Top 5 items of yesterday, yesterday's sales, this week's points. So you're kinda expected to come earlier than stated. If you don't copy them down, you'll be clueless and singled out. \n\nCustomer service is the most important. You have a specific way to stand, and standard phrases to reply with.

{"body":"I think the maze has a physicality, but it's not quite so cartographic as a map with one specific location as a start and end point. Dolores had to literally retrace her steps multiple times, and receive visual and physical cues multiple times (being dragged by MIB, rewalking the path she took with William, hearing Arnold's voice before hearing it as her own, etc) in order to realize she's done them before, been there before. She never would have achieved consciousness without iterative action. A brain in a sealed box that never interacts with anything never develops. The physical act of repeating, returning to the buried town, taking the multiple trips and steps to get there, is eventually what brought her \"through the maze\" to consciousness on the other side. The maze is more the physicality (and correlated mentality) of progressive loops, rather than a direct concrete path, but it is still a physically and materially manifested path nonetheless. \n\nEdit (in response to your actual comment): I'm not sure she (or any host) needed to find the church specifically, but the physical act of retracing her steps brought her back to her (and Arnold's) past memories/attempts at gaining consciousness. The church was involved in her past memories (before her current role), and thus was needed for her to push her into consciousness. So I think it's... both. She had to go to the church because she's been there many times before with progressively more memory of her past, and it was a \"natural\" consequence of her progressive looping over time.","score":"27","subreddit":"westworld"}

So many people saying we should just let people live in extreme poverty to stop overpopulation.\n\nDid you ever notice how the most extreme examples of overpopulation are in the countries with the worst poverty? That's because people in poverty are more likely to have children than people in developed richer nations. Birth rates actually drop when standard of living is increased (and that decrease is more than enough to make up for the extra people who are surviving). That's why places like India or certain parts of Africa have massive population growth but in places like Japan, the population is going down and getting older. People are less likely to have children and those who do tend to have fewer children when their children aren't dying off from starvation and disease.\n\nEvery country on earth has had a point where birth rates were high, even in the U.S. people were having more children on average before the industrial revolution made our lives easier. Every developing nation will likely go through the same change. Completely ignoring the people in the areas causing overpopulation is the exact opposite of what we need to solve the problem.","score":"-5","subreddit":"worldnews"}

The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment, of the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life (lex devina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved.[1] ***To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order*** since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.[2]\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nYou should not live your life with your only goal to have happiness.\n\nWe must seek knowledge of the Natural Laws.\n\n*Better to seek truth than happiness.*\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;","score":"26","subreddit":"TheRedPill"}

{"body":"I think the best version of this analogy is the Baseball World Series. Trump and Clinton are playing 7 games, whoever wins 4 of them wins the championship. Baseball pitchers can't play every game in the series because of the strain. Clinton has a pitcher guaranteed to pitch a no-hitter, but can only play two games (representing New York and Commiefornia). Instead of slamming the wall and actually trying to win those games, Trump puts out the pee-wee squad to play those games, allowing Clinton to win two games with 8-0 scores. In the other 5 games, he plays better than Clinton because his players are better rested, and wins 4 games 6-4. Clinton scored more runs in those 6 games (28 to 24), but it doesn't matter because that's not how you win the series. If total runs scored mattered, Trump would have tried in those first two games, keeping Clinton from making the big scores.","score":"48","subreddit":"The_Donald"}

Well honestly I thought she coddling Okabe was in her character more than slapping.

But when it was up, it hit hard enough to make up for those down times.\n\n\n\nThat being said... yes, Charlie's death was an amazing moment of television. When Season 4 began, I had the good fortune for my work to cross paths with Dominic Monoghan. After chatting for a bit, I asked if I may ask him a LOST question. \"I don't know what the smoke monster is, man!\" No-no-no... I assured him it wasn't anything like that...\n\nIn the series, it was established that Charlie was Catholic. But in his final moment, he does the sign of the cross with his *left* hand, which is considered by most as \"inappropriate.\" His reply: \"Ah, do you know why I did that?\" No, that's why I'm asking... He went on to explain his intention. That Charlie has done a lot of fucked up things in his life. It was a small nod/way for Charlie to meet his maker and acknowledge who he was.\n\n\n\nThought you'd enjoy the anecdote. Now imagine you had to wait months between each cliffhanger?!?! In all seriousness, savor Season 4. It might be my favorite.\n\nENJOY!\n\n^^^^^Live^Together;^Die^Alone\n\n\nEdit: Somehow missed the **RE**-Watching. I'm an idiot.

{"body":"I mean, The adventures themselves are like starter sets.  15-20 dollars for 4-5 legends, a number of other cards is pretty good value, and you can always dust cards to turn into the other cards you need.  \n\nHuge disadvantage for blizz is that your concept lowers the value of packs and gold in the game if ppl can just buy into things even easier/cheaper than before.  This means less of a reason to grind.  Less grinding means ppl are more likely to play, stop, and just never start up again (especially with the phone game era, players are very fickle and easily distracted).  Ways to do it that avoids this pothole, but its there.\n\n\nIf anything, they should try to release adventure content more often.  Maybe something like a new self contained \"wing\" every month for 5 dollars that comes with a specific legend card and a small handful of other cards (like wings do).  Sometimes it could be new cards, sometimes old cards from the classic set.  Then the last match would have you use a \"created deck\" using the core cards you earned from the wing, but with other good cards added (which means you want to spend more money to create that deck you just played.   This would 1. Give new content.  2. Let ppl have an easier time getting some of those good classic cards but roll it out slow enough to not lose them players/money. 3. Keep ppl engaged all year instead of playing for a few weeks before/after xpac only.  \n\n\nFree c'thun is actually a good example here because it has very clear cheap cards, a clear main legend, and some costly \"obvious additional\" cards that aren't required for the deck to run.  \n\n\nHeck, at the end it could ask if you want to create the deck you just played so you can see what you are missing (pushes you to buy more packs too, while helping players to create a cohesive deck)","score":"18","subreddit":"hearthstone"}

{"body":"For those who are not too familiar with this stock, here are some points from my research:\n\nPro: \n\n- Bremelanotide has met its primary phase 3 endpoints and is eligible for PTN to submit an application to the FDA. Per PTN, this will likely be in 2H 2017.\n\n- The drug is considered superior to Addyi, which was bought for 1b and is the only other competitor to Brem currently on the market.\n\n- Addyi was approved by the FDA, yet has some questionable side effects. By comparison, Brem is safer and thus should also be granted approval by the FDA.\n\n- The current market cap is quite low for a company in this position (60-80m), so there is plenty of room for growth on positive news.\n\n- As per PTN's last earnings conference call, a Nov 2 reuters report and 1-2 other sources, there is outside interest in the drug. PTN have stated that they do not have the resources to market/sell this drug themselves, thus are seeking either a partnership, sale of the asset, or sale of the company. They hired an investment bank to assist them in making the best decision.\n\n- There is no other competition beyond phase 2 studies, so they have a niche in the market place.\n\nCon:\n\n- PTN are cash strapped. They are a development company with no income. With their recent December public offering, they have enough cash for another 2-4 months. If there is no action within the next month or two, the possibility exists they may need to dilute further for working capital.\n\n- Brem's only current application is via auto-injector (needle). This may be perceived as a negative as potential users could be turned off by this.\n\n- Data from secondary end-point has not been released to the public. While there is some debate that SSE (satisfying sexual events) are not a fair validation for this drug, we can't ignore the fact that the data has not been released to us (though it is available to potential suitors). Negative secondary data may effect the stock price or collaboration options.\n\n- Addyi sales are not good. While it is believed that the side-effects are the primary reason for this, companies may be reluctant to approach the valuation applied to Addyi.\n\n- Warrants. The company currently has 133m outstanding shares, but approx another 120m in warrants that will be exercised if/when the share price exceeds $.80. This is likely what is keeping the share price in check. Bare in mind that if the company receives and approves a significant collaboration offer, it will be applied to a 252m float, not 133m.\n\nI believe the positives outweigh the negatives and I'm holding just over 33k shares. I'm going to give them until mid-february to get something done, and then I plan on pulling the plug if there are no updates. I don't want to get caught in another public offering. Given that interest was expressed publicly in early November, this will give them 3 months to complete a deal of some sort. Conservatively, I value this stock at about $2 (500m mkt cap), which would be about 300% above today's price.\n\nJust remember, there are no sure bets in these stocks. Proceed at your own risk.\n ","score":"17","subreddit":"pennystocks"}

I think the best feat that DD has is the elevator/hallway fight in the second season, and he took hits and was clearly exhausted by the end. The only hit Chirrut took was when he had his guard down in impossible odds. \n\nR3: I think Chirrut takes these 7-8/10 anyways, but to give him a 10/10 then put DD in a tie fighter in a canyon and give Chirrut his blaster. \n\nR4: Daredevil wins in the courthouse. Chirrut isn't bar certified. Jokes aside I think Daredevil would be better in a challenge situation. If the task was liberating Jedha without the interference of the Death Star I think Daredevil would make more progress than Chirrut.

{"body":"So, first off the Longsword looses hard. They are considerably slower, more fragile, and vastly under-armed compared to their opponents' vessels; only the SHIVA nuclear warhead is remotely comparable to its opponents' ordinance, and that missile body is not intended for track fighters in flight - plus, each Longsword carries exactly one.\n\nIt then comes down to the Fury versus the X-Wing, and it's hard to compare them - the Fury has a crew of two to four and is 3-5 1/2 times larger than an X-wing depending on the Pattern of Fury. I suspect it is markedly less maneuverable on account of its crew not having artificial gravity, instead relying on sophisticated spacesuits to counteract inertial forces on their bodies.\n\nThe Fury also does not have the benefit of shields, although given the advanced armors of the 41st millenium this is much less of a setback than you might expect. It's noted as carrying \"anti-starship\" missiles, although it isn't clear if \"starship\" includes \"starfighter\" or merely larger hulls. The real problem here is I'm not aware of real hard feats for the Fury to base its weapons on, and Lascannons come in a variety of sizes and yields.\n\nIf we assume that the Fury's Lascannons are roughly analogous to the X-Wing's lasers, then the Fury loses if it is a standard pattern - poor maneuverability and large size make it an easy target. If it is one of the Fury patterns with an additional ball turret, however, it has the potential to hold a nasty surprise for the X-Wings.\n\n**Round 1:** My inclination is that the X-Wings take losses, but ultimately manage to engage the Furies successfully. If the Fury's are ball-turret patterns, it's a lot closer.\n\n**Round 2:** Starhawk Bombers are *massive* compared to Y-Wings, and the latter is not (despite its portrayal in games) actually a dedicated attacker/bomber but rather a starfighter with some viability in that role. Furthermore, the Dictator is enormous compared to Home One and simply has much more to chew through. Dictator takes this.","score":"25","subreddit":"whowouldwin"}

{"body":"It's not that hard, you can easily see if something is a key from the first 5 characters and how many dashes are in it.\n\nSo you can throw away everything that doesn't come close to a key (with regex or something). \n\nSecondly if an extension has the same functionality you need in a bot there is probably a bot out there with the same functionality maybe even same code as the extension. Also it's probably quite easy to implement that extension in a bot of some sorts.\n\nNext with the knowledge that ocr is sometimes not as reliable at some kind of angle why wouldn't you let the bot turn the image around for a few extra views on the code?\n\nA computer can do these things pretty fast. I've made bots that can find words in wordseeker puzzles, it could get about 20 matches in somewhat over a second even without predefined answers. \n\nIt's not that hard if you know what you're doing and even then I didn't use ocr although the bot could handle the 8 directions of the puzzle (even reading backwards although puzzles like that took some more seconds) ","score":"19","subreddit":"pcmasterrace"}

{"body":"I was on a date with a woman I had met through a work function. We went to a nice Italian place that was near my office and were having a really pleasant evening, though the waiter seemed to have a thing for my date. It's a family-owned place and not at all unusual for the wait staff to pay general compliments to the customers. It can set a really great atmosphere, but this guy was borderline hitting on my date - enough for her to uncomfortably ask me if it was normal.\nA few minutes after the entrees arrived the waiter swung by to make sure everything was acceptable, but he laid it on thick by implying that I didn't deserve such a lovely woman. We laughed it off, but a minute later I excused myself to use the rest room and tracked down the waiter to request that he tone it down a few notches, as he was embarrassing himself, my date and me. He was a bit overconfident in feigning ignorance, but assured me he would refrain from further compliments.\nThe service was absolutely fine after that and it became a memorable evening of getting to know someone new in a romantic setting. Until the check came - I stuck my credit card in the bill book, but when the waiter returned he apologized and said the card had been declined. I immediately knew what was going on because I pay my CC off in full every single month - I don't use it for big, long-term purchases.\nHe insists that he tried it twice, and that perhaps we try another card... or my date could pay the bill. I'm usually pretty levelheaded in tense situations, but I have to admit this nearly ruined the evening for me. I kept my voice down, but demanded the owner visit the table to get involved. The waiter assured me that wasn't necessary and that he'd try the card again, but I insisted and said I would track her down myself if he didn't care to.\nThe look on his face when he realized that this was happening was sweeter than the dessert we'd shared. He disappeared for about a minute and returned with the check, claiming that it went through this time and would I still care to involve the owner.\nWere it not for 20% gratuity being built into the bill, I would have said no. Instead I told him that he could refund me the 20%, or I could request the owner do it. Sheepishly he said: \"Yes sir, I'll remove the tip immediately.\"\nThe woman and I never got very serious, but this was a great inside joke that kept us laughing on the few dates we had after that.","score":"23","subreddit":"pettyrevenge"}

It can be subtle cues or from a history of making out/ hooking up (you may think it would be certain at that point, but not for everyone); whatever it is, you need SOME evidence that they would feel the same way. \n\nIn a way, confessions like these are somewhat selfish. \"I love you, what are you going to do about it?\" is such a game changer in a friendship, especially when the object of affection does not feel the same way. YOU basically create an awkward situation and possibly compromise the friendship. It's hard because often times, the other person *does* care about you, just not in the way you would like.

In this specific case, Bill French as \"Dr. Bill Warner, PhD\" used that credential as an implicit claim of expertise to lend authority to what he was talking about at that moment.\n\nAs my answer demonstrated, he lacks the skills to back up the *expertise* signified by a PhD in history. Most basically, he applies the standards and values of the 21st century as a way to judge the 9th as successful or unsuccessful. (That is: he requires medieval scientists and scholars to have achieved the same results as modern scholars despite VASTLY different technological levels and, oh yeah, the fact that modern science would look vastly different if those medieval scholars had not existed.) This is not expert-level historical methodology. This is not even high school-level historical methodology.\n\nHe does not have the expertise that he tries to pretend he does by using the PhD here. It's disingenous.\n\nIncidentally, scientists and mathematicians who are willing to do the additional work to gain expertise in history (that is, in the methods of historical research) are an *incredible* boon to the field. Very on topic here is George Saliba's *Islamic Science and the Making of the European Renaissance.* Saliba is a professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies who actually started with a B.S. in mathematics, and puts that knowledge to incredible use in understanding the past and communicating it clearly. The telling of history benefits SO much from people with additional expertise--so long as they gain the expertise to do the history part correctly as well.\n\nBill French/Bill Warner does not have that expertise, but he wants us to think he does, and his dishonesty must be called out.","score":"26","subreddit":"AskHistorians"}
{"body":"The short reason is that it happened by accident in the reign of Edward III (r. 1327-77), Edward I's grandson. Edward II was know during his lifetime as 'King Edward, son of King Edward', but this didn't really work for *his* son, so he (Edward III, that is) became known as 'the third Edward'. Although this wasn't intended to start a precedent for regnal numbering, merely to differentiate three successive kings named Edward, it ended up having that effect. \n\nFor the record though, even in Edward I's time, it was well know that he wasn't the first king of England named Edward - he was explicitly named by his father, Henry III, in honour of (Saint) Edward the Confessor. There was also, of course, another Anglo-Saxon king named Edward, the little known Edward the Elder (r. 899-924), Alfred the Great's son and heir [and Edward the Martyr, see below]. So if we were to follow a strictly correct regal numbering: Edward the Confessor would be Edward ~~II~~ III; Edward Plantagenet, Hammer of the Scots would be Edward ~~III~~ IV; Edward son of Henry VIII would be Edward ~~VIII~~ IX; and David Windsor would have abdicated in scandal with the regnal name Edward ~~X~~ XI. One of those funny little accidents of history!\n\nEdit: Drat, I forgot about (yet another) little-known Anglo-Saxon Edward, Edward the Martyr (r. 975-8), so called because he was murdered after a very short reign, probably by partisans of his half-brother Aethered ('the Unready'); he was venerated as a saint at his tomb in Shaftesbury Abbey within a few years of his death.

{"body":"In the UK, Records at Kew (National Archives) hold documents for sailors and their pensions from the 17th to the 20th century. Greenwich had a hospital/retirement home for sailors from the 18th century onwards, and houses some records, conveniently a short stroll form the National Maritime Museum, whch also has a lot of records. \n\nFrom what I can recall of my higher education in things of maritime history, battle wounds/associated injuries account for surprisingly few injuries; the is because a ship engages in battle for very little of its functioning life. The most common injuries and ailments are everyday things; gut problems (terrible food and scurvy); skin conditions (lice, poor hygiene etc); hernia and strains (no mechanical lifting aids); and accidents from falling from aloft. We also know that amputation does not always result in automatic retirement; in times of necessity they could still be serving. So logically, hearing loss and tinnitus may not have been quite so widespread; after all, the guns are not fired everyday, and when they are it's not a all day event - unless you are in battle. And of course, given that you are away from land for months at a time, you're not going to waste your ammunition on, bar for regular, rather than frequent, practice. The lack of mention of hearing problems may imply this, or I could be completely wrong. I'm fairly certain that hearing loss and tinnitus are caused by constant, persitant sound levels above acceptable range - given the relative small size of ships it seems unlikely that only a few would be affected (if it was many, it would have higher mention), and that such a source of noise was present in the pre-industrial age. \n\nTemporary loss is certainly highly likely, but its repetition, leading to permanent loss/damage, that is the key. It may be worth mentioning that an brief work colleague of mine who had been an army engineer had hearing loss; the loss was in the lower registers, resulting in his setting his ringtone to some horrific high pitched squeak that drove everyone else nuts - but it was that only kind of noise he could reliably hear, especailly at a distance. It may be that the bosun's whistle was the 18t/19th century equivalent, so that hearing loss in the lower registers was something to be coped with and worked around, given that a significant part of everday life was routine and ritual. But I'm no expert...\n\nSome injuries resuted in discharge and a pension, but tinnitus and hearing loss is not one I have personally come across. Undoubtably it occured and sailors were discharged for it. It was likely regarded as largely untreatable, however this is another area for research. \n\nThe book 'Jack Tar' by Roy \u0026amp; Leslie Adkins may be of interest to you, as would the institutions mentioned in the first paragraph. \n\nAs a sidenote, 'cannon' aboard a ship of war are referred to as guns, regardless of size.
