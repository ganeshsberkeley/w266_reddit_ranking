{"body":"People are going to say it's planned obsolesce on Nvidia's part, but it's really not. \n\nMost of AMD's GCN releases should have destroyed Nvidia's counterparts from the start. Look at a 7970 vs a 680 for example. These two cards were released around the same time frame and competed at a similar price point. \n\n* The 7970 is a 3.7Tflop 3GB card\n* The 680 is a 2.5Tflop 2GB card\n\nThe 7970 should have completely smoked the 680 when it launched. It didn't for a number of reasons. One GCN was a brand new architecture, completely different than the VLIW 6xxx series before it, while Kepler was a largely refined Fermi. The second was AMD's driver performance was simply not up to par, especially in multithreaded scenarios. The third is that parts of the card were simply un-utilized, Async for example didn't even become a thing until very recently. \n\nNow, 3 or 4 years later, game developers have had time to learn the architecture. It being utilized in consoles have allowed the devs to find the strengths of GCN and target them. A lot of these strengths also happen to be weaknesses for Nvidia. Compute performance for example, is significantly better on AMD's GCN than it is on Nvidia's Kepler series for a number of reasons. So when it's utilized in games, it actually hurts Nvidia's overall performance. AMD has also been making really good strides in improving DX11 Multithreaded driver performance. Couple that with DX12 and Async and suddenly GCN as a whole, including our 7970, is actually starting to perform more closely to what you'd expect from the specs. \n\nI guess you can blame Nvidia for not foreseeing some of these changes, not improving parts of their architecture where games were going to be trending. But Nvidia will almost always be a step behind now, due to AMD's control of the console market. Any new piece of technology they add to Polaris, for example, will almost immediately find it's way into the DX12 spec. Nvidia will then have to wait an entire architecture in order to implement it.\n\nOverall it's pretty clear that this was part of AMD's strategy with the consoles. By becoming the default card for DX12, they could essentially push their technology into use, allowing their current and older cards to get proper utilization. Hopefully they can take it and make some money going forward. \n\n","score":"150","subreddit":"Amd"}

{"body":"Was it not implicit (or even explicit) enough in my comment? The difference is simple, but important.\n\nSelf-imposed 'censorship' is *okay*. This isn't oppression. It's merely the owner playing to different audiences for their own interests. They are *choosing* to change things up to appeal to a broader audience in each respective market - and/or to avoid any chance of bad publicity. \n\nLook, I totally understand those who want the 'same' product... Though, personally, I take more issue when changes are made that actively change the intent or relationship between characters. Or when things are completely re-framed because the original content was deemed *too culturally specific* to Japan... But that's because I'm actually intrigued and interested in things that are culturally specific to Japan. But again, it's the owner of this 'artistic expression' making the call - and so there is no *outrage*... just disappointment. And sorry, but making sexy outfits slightly less sexy hardly effects the integrity of this product, specifically.\n\nI mean, if you were to go to a comedy show with a headlining comedian who often tells jokes regarding race or sexuality - Let's use Louis CK as an example because his racial/gay jokes are usually either harmless or completely insincere... And let's say that during the 2 opening acts there were other comedians telling racial/gay jokes and the audience wasn't into it. They groaned, remained silent, were angered - or, perhaps, *too* into those kinds of jokes... So, let's say Louis CK decides to omit a lot of his racial/gay jokes to play towards his audience so that more people leave feeling like they had a good time.\n\nWould you consider this 'censorship' or an active 'censoring of artistic expression'? \n\n*Bad* censorship is when government actively blocks it without changes. And there is some argument for those instances of powerful entities - essentially - censoring something by preventing mass distribution - but even that's arguable. (I'm referring, mostly, to all major retailers blocking any sells of AO-rated games.)","score":"-5","subreddit":"PS4"}

One of his tenants was an *extremely* disturbed and mentally handicapped obese lady. Like, complete schizophrenic, 300 lb., mind of a 9 year old. I have no idea how she lived as long as she did. Anyway, her mental issues apparently started to get really really bad and she had about 20 poor cats living with her in this small 1 bedroom apartment. She never cleaned up after them, or let them outside. Eventually, she died. The life in her apartment went on for the most part though for about a month. That is, until the cats started dying too. Most of the people in that apartment complex were immigrants who had illegal family members or friends staying with them so nobody complained about it for a very long time. When they did, Hazmat had to be called in because there was the corpse of a 400 lb lady, about 10 dead cats, a few dead kittens, and about 2 inches of cat shit and vomit covering the entire floor. My dad is a huge cheapskate and didn't want to pay the guys who took the dead body out to properly clean the rest so of course I had to help him clean it all up. I'll never forget the horror of the floor. The whole floor was moving there were so many maggots. I had to pick up little dead kittens. You could smell it from outside in the court.

So, yes, in the case of money laundering, there are real victims.\n\n**Edit:** Taxation is necessary for a functioning society. Without taxation we would have no public services of any note, such as affordable utilities and healthcare. A subjective view of the quality of one's own local services in this regard is not a realistic comparison on the overall ethos of such services. The best method of taxation is debatable, I prefer taxation on consumption as being more fair than taxation on income, which as we will discover more about tomorrow (9th May) is easily avoided by some. Foreign wars are rarely justified, and the promotion and involvement in proxy wars is something that the rest of the world continues to permit, or at the very least, turn a blind eye to.\n\nTaxation serves purposes greater than war and my initial comment was that tax evasion is not a victimless crime, more it is one performed by the wealthier to the detriment of the poorer.

{"body":"FOSE and SKSE are extensions to the game's modding API that increases the number of options modders have when they write mods.\n\n'API' stands for Application program interface: it's like a control panel the developers give you that connects to the game behind the scenes.\n\n\nSay you are modding in a new quest, you can write this:\n\n\n     Scriptname MyTriggerBoxScript extends ObjectReference\n \n     Quest Property MyQuest Auto\n     Int Property StageToSet Auto\n \n     Event OnTriggerEnter(ObjectReference akActionRef)\n     \tIf akActionRef == Game.GetPlayer()\n     \t\tMyQuest.SetStage(StageToSet)\n     \tEndIf\n  \n     EndEvent\n\n\nAnd attach it to an invisible box. The actual programming there doesn't matter, but basically what it's doing is every time something hits the box you made, it checks to see if it's the player or something else (NPC, grenade, etc...)\nif it IS the player, it updates the quest to the next 'stage'.\n\nIf you skim through it, you'll see things like:\n\n`Game.GetPlayer()` \u0026lt;--- gives back a programming object that holds info about the player  \n`MyQuest.SetStage()` \u0026lt;---- Sets what part of a quest you are on\n\nThose are API endpoints that the developers give to the players. The modder doesn't have to care about HOW 'GetPlayer' gets their player, they know that if they call it, they will get the player back. If the devs update the way the game handles the Player, they will also update this API so the call will still return the expected Player object. \nFor example, say they add co-op in a patch. They would have to completely change how players are tracked and stored, but to a modder they don't care about that. If the person playing the game enters the box, their quest gets an update.\n\nThis is awesome, because it lets people make mods that will be compatible with the game, even if the game gets updated. The downside is you can be limited pretty heavily in your mod compared to what a developer can do if they don't make the API extensive enough.\n\nThis page has a list of every call a modder can make with a vanilla mod:\n\nhttp://www.creationkit.com/fallout4/index.php?title=Category:Papyrus\n\nFor 99% of mods, this is plenty. If you want to add a new weapon or quest or NPC, you're pretty much good to go.\n\nBut what if you wanted to do something that's not on that list? \n\nSay you want to write a mod that sends your player's location to a web server so you can have a minimap on your phone that follows you while you play.\n\nWell, the API on that page has nothing about connecting to a server... so you simply can't do it with a vanilla mod. But, if you could change the game files that define the API and add your own 'connect_to_server' function, suddenly you can use that 'connect_to_server' feature in your mod scripts. The downside is that now you are messing with the game's files. This is something that a console player can't do, and something that is annoying for most PC players- instead of clicking 'subscribe' they now have to download your package, drag the files into the correct space, and deal with any issues that pop up, for example- if two modders create a mod that wants to connect to a web server, they both are changing the same API definition file- only the last mod that was installed will work!\n\nTo get around this, modders use SKSE/FOSE - it's an extension the the game's API that adds tons of new API functions, and most modders agree to use it, so you don't have to worry about conflicts or installing a game hack for each mod you download. Instead, you install the single script extender and you're good to go. When the game gets updated, you just have to wait for the extension team to upgrade the single script extender and everyone's mods start working again. If you need a feature, you can write it, then submit it to the script extension team and they might add it to their release meaning you (and everyone else who might want to use that feature) can safely use it!\n\nThe downside is you are once again limited by an API, but you are MUCH MUCH MUCH more likely to be able to contact the extender dev team and get your script added than you would be if you tried to contact Bethesda. The other downside is, because it requires modifying the files of the game itself and loading 'untrusted' code, it's not going to work for consoles.","score":"31","subreddit":"fo4"}

If Draymond Green wants to kick people in the junk, trip people while laying on his back, and try to tear arms out of their sockets, he needs to find a different sport to play. I am appalled at the lack of disciplinary action levied against Draymond Green for his actions thus far during this year's playoffs. I recommend you remove his jersey from the NBA.com store or officially review his foul on Steven Adams in game 7 and assess him, at the very least, a flagrant 1. There is no place in NBA basketball for players who try to injure other players, and Green, despite starting on the league's best team, is not immune to criticism of his actions from true fans of basketball. Commissioner, I implore you, suspend Draymond Green for game 1 of the NBA Finals.\nSigned,\nNot a Bitchketball Fan","score":"-11","subreddit":"nba"}

If you're especially interested in a Maya campaign, it would serve you well to play as some Aztec warriors and priests on a mission to try and make contact with these aloof, fleeting, almost elven magician-kings - the setting is there but the bones are ready for you to build your personal obsession with the Maya atop.\n\nIf you're really interested I have a private website I made for my players with a lot of the info and lore from the game (explained in my own flippant style) as well as some of the rules. It's not finished yet but there's a lot to get you going. I'm not going to post it because strictly speaking I'm probably in breach of some copyright or another but it's purely for like 4-5 people tops so whatever.

{"body":"I think elitism has a view different view points. Having been someone who has raged at numerous people for ['being bad'](http://imgur.com/5Q3C7ml) maybe I could offer a little insight. I raid one day a week, I do not log in for anything else. I simply only enjoy the raiding left in WoD and want to see how far we can get into mythics before legion drops.\n\nNow I'm sure anyone raiding has either been or seen the people who 'play to have fun'. While I understand this concept I do understand it in progression raiding. I raid to kill bosses, I don't raid to lose to bosses because being in vent with everyone is somehow fun regardless of wipe count. So when we have people that will come to raid, with no food, flask, potions, missing gems or enchants. I can't help but see a little red. When we have people with a gear item level 15 ilevel lower than another of the same class and the lesser is doing double the damage, I see a little red.\n\nI've raided cutting edge progression raids where if you are doing everything right 98% of the time, they will replace you for someone doing right 99% of the time for the slight better increase. I left that back in the wrath days as now with a more demanding job and family I can't be on much anymore. So for me logging in one day a week to raid is enough. So I can't for the life of me figure out what these people who put no effort into raiding do all week if they call themselves raiders. And don't even get me started on trying to talk to them. \"Dude I'm trying my internet is just bad\", \"There is no way he has worse gear than me\" \"parses don't matter at all we killed the boss regardless\".\n\nSo what does elitism bring to the table for me? Learning who actually gives a shit to put in the smallest amount of effort to reach a common goal, and who can get an invite again next week and who to never ever bring again.

{"body":"Porn does feature (relatively) huge cocks statistically speaking, given the human average erect length of either 5.1 or 5.6 inches depending on the study you consult (see my other comment nearby in this thread), but as you point out, it's all about movie magic as well.\n\nIt is a standard practice to massively inflate reported dick sizes in porn (and real life), so that what is actually a 7.5 inch cock (still statistically huge) is bumped up to 9.5 inches, and a 9 inch cock is bumped up to 11.5 or even 12 for marketing purposes.\n\nA good example is [Peter North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_North_%28actor%29), IMO the top male performer of the 80s and 90s, and perhaps of all time. He used to be reported as having a 9\"+ dick, but more realistically it's around 7 inches.\n\nThe cocks aren't fake, and they aren't using CGI or anything, and they ARE statistically giant, but on top of the measurement inflation,  there are a TONNE of techniques they use to make them looking ginormous.\n\n**- 1) Use cock-friendly camera angles and lenses:**\n\nSpecific angles and lenses are almost always used to maximize perceived length and girl. Ever wonder why the formerly classic 90s shot from underneath the guy, between his legs, showing his cock going in the girl is never used anymore? Because all you see from that angle is his ass and his balls and maybe an inch of his cock. Making him look tiny. Watch 90s VIVID VIDEO porn with Jenna Jameson and you see that all the time. You pretty much never see that shit on LegalPorno.com or Kink.com or Brazzers or Tushy.com or Tiny4K or NaughtyAmerica or Digital Playground or RealityKings or EvilAngel or ElegantAngel in the 2010s.\n\nA big part of porn is trying to get insecure guys to identify with the giant cock on screen, and imagine that it belongs to them. And that somehow that pornstar's cock is a \"surrogate dick\" for the guy fapping at home, who is vicariously living out his fantasies of pounding tight 18-year old pussy 24-7. That's pretty much the whole theme of POV porn.\n\nSo a big part of porn is dedicated to using whatever angles and lenses make the guy look as big as possible. Just like with cumshots. The bigger the better.\n\n**-2) Hire short male performers:**\n\nLots of porn stars are short. [Mandingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandingo_%28actor%29), often referred to as having the \"biggest dick in porn\" is 5 foot 7. His dick is \"claimed to be 12 inches.\" I wouldn't be surprised if it was closer to 10, which is still insanely big. And a 10 inch cock on a guy that is 5 foot 7 will absolutely look GIGANTIC in proportion to the rest of his body.\n\nIt will look WAY bigger on a 5 foot 7 dude than on a guy who is 6 foot 5. And that difference in proportions will have a huge effect on perceived size. I know from experience. I'm 5 foot 7 and have a 6.15\" dick. I've had multiple girls tell me how \"big\" it is, or how it's even \"really big.\" In reality, at least according to all the stats, I'm either 1 inch above average, or just at the high end of average. So I'm not exactly huge. But because I'm short it just looks bigger than it is.\n\n**-3) Hire reallllllllllllly tiny female performers:**\n\nA huge amount of female actresses are petite. Part of this is because men in general have a huge fixation on fucking hot young women (18+ only, of course!), and youth is massively valued in our society, especially in women. And petite women often look younger than taller or broader women. So you can have a 23 year old doing a scene where it's her \"first time,\" and she'll say she's 18 or 19, and we all play along cause we like the fantasy.\n\nAlso, you'll get a lot of actual 18 and 19 year olds in porn, but there is always a HUGE focus on girls that are petite. Think of Riley Reid and Dakota Skye right now. Or Piper Perri.\n\nFor one, yes, these girls look young due to their small size, which is what porn people want. Young = sexy. However, they also cast really tiny girls because **TINY GIRLS MAKE BIG COCKS LOOK ENORMOUS IN COMPARISON!**\n\nThink of all those \"Teens Like it Big\" shoots. The girls are always really small, like between 5 foot 0 and 5 foot 4. That's because when you bring in the donkey-dicked Criss Strokes to give em a good hammering, it will look like he's playing ball with a Louisville Slugger. How many times have you seen the shot where he puts his dick against their face or their forearm, and they say \"omg it's bigger than my arm?!!!\" \n\nWell do you know who has small arms? 110 lb girls that are 5 foot 1. And apparently Strokes is really packing \"only\" 7.5 inches. I just found a blog that is even more obsessed about this topic than I am, but it's insanely NSFW and full of loads of carefully annotated dick pics to back up it's claims. It's pretty hilarious, actually, in a weird way.","score":"164","subreddit":"IAmA"}

{"body":"You seem to be confusing a 14-day return policy and a product warranty/repair policy.\n\nA return is a return. You return the product, in working condition, and get your money back. There's no need to investigate whether it qualifies for repair or whatever. You just send it back and get your money back. You've essentially reversed the transaction. This is what's available for 14-days. You can send back a perfectly working product under these terms. This is not an exchange policy. This is a *return* policy.\n\nThen there's the product warranty, under which you can receive a warranty repair for a defective product. This is where you send them a defective unit, they investigate, and repair or exchange for a replacement. You don't get to pick which. Warranties are typically not limited to 14-days. I'm not sure what the HTC Vive warranty period is, probably 1 year, but they usually vary from 30 days to multiple years. If it's a 1 year policy, then you can get it repaired in 6 months for any manufacturing defects, not just within 14 days.\n\nWhat it seems like you expected is a \"14-day no-questions-asked exchange or refund\" period, which some companies occasionally offer. This is not offered on the HTC Vive and was never promised in any product literature or reddit threads I've seen. Unfortunately in this situation there's never been an expressed offer to exchange your product for a new one, so unless they're feeling generous, that's not an option.\n\nAs others have mentioned though, there are currently no refurbs available, so you essentially get exchanged for a new one *if* they deem it valid for warranty repair. Given again that this would be a *repair* and not a *refund*, it's possible you can run into issues with them deeming it not in need of repair and simply returning it to you unmodified.\n\nP.S.

A lot of the info you put in there might make tracking down \"The real you online\" a lot easier:\n~~http://www.camgirl-nation.com/privacy-tips-amazon-wishlist-safety-tips/~~ http://www.camgirl-nation.com/privacy-tips-making-a-safe-bio/ (this one has lots of tips on how to not share personally identifiable info.\n\nHere's the relevant info from that particular post:\n\n\u0026gt;A scenario on how your bio can reveal too much about you\n\n\u0026gt;So let’s look at a typical bio. The girl’s cam name is “sexykitten94”. Her birthdate is April 5, 1994. She loves her pets and lists her two cats Puffles and Mr. Jones, as well as her dog Lucky. She also loves the Miami Dolphins. She’s got a really great Amazon wishlist on her bio too, asking for all kinds of fun things. You know, your basic Chaturbate bio.\n\n\u0026gt;So lets see how a jerk that wants to either stalk her or mess with her looks at that information. First he suspects she lives in Florida, because she’s a Dolphins fan. Then he goes to her Amazon wishlist; yup, she lives in Boca Del Mar, Florida, a small city next to Boca Raton (because Amazon wishlists reveal your city with your wishlist). Then he heads over to Facebook. Using the info he now knows; she lives in Boca Del Mar, she has three pets named Puffles, Mr. Jones, and Lucky, her birthdate is April 5, 1994, and she loves the Dolphins… how long do you figure it would take to find the Facebook page of the model given that it’s likely filled with photos and posts about Puffles, Mr. Jones, and Lucky, and mentions of her city, and of course lots of posts about the hapless Dolphins. The birthdate seals the deal, not to mention the hundreds of photos that confirm that she is, in fact, sexykitten94.\n\n\u0026gt;So now he knows who she really is. Has she ever posted her real email on a site somewhere along with her name? Yeah, that’s a two second google search to find out. Similarly he can fairly readily track down her home address. So now he has her name, her email, her birthdate, her address, and a bunch of identifiable info that is typically used as “security questions” when you log into your bank account, or sign up for some site. You know, the sites where they ask for “your high school mascot” (yep, she mentioned prominently on Facebook where she went to school), and “where does your nearest sibling live” (she has tons of posts about visiting her sister in Orlando). And of course she’s like so many people who uses one of her pet’s names as her common password (and adding “1” to the end of “Puffles” doesn’t make it more secure).\n\n\u0026gt;Or, since he knows her facebook page; and he can guess her password (“Puffles1”), he logs on as her, and contacts her friends saying “she got in trouble in mexico and needs some money to get home”. Or he just posts a bunch of screenshots of her cam sessions to her facebook page; sharing it with all her friends and family who have no idea that she cams.\n\n\u0026gt;It is honestly frighteningly simple to take over your personal accounts with just the most basic of info. And this says nothing about the folks who just want to plain show up at your home and stalk you.\n\n\u0026gt;So what to do?\n\n\u0026gt;Use a different birthdate than your real one.\n\u0026gt;Do not post information that is identical to information on your “real life” social media accounts; use your camgirl bio to show a part of you that you probably never share in your real life social media and vice versa; and don’t let the two mix. Ever.\nDo a google search of your email address. Is it “out there” on the internet? Does it link to identifiable info about you? Consider having THREE emails: your camgirl email, your “public” email that might get posted in places on the internet; and a very private one that you use for your bank account and other important stuff.\n\u0026gt;Consider getting a post office box in the city next to your current city, so amazon would show a different location. Or better yet, just ask people to give you amazon gift cards, which only requires your camgirl email address.\n\u0026gt;Never use your pet’s names as part of your password. Ever. EVER!\n\u0026gt;Mostly you just want to always be careful; think of it as having two lives; and they really shouldn’t intersect.","score":"188","subreddit":"asmr"}

{"body":" It's great at a foundation level to ensure students are all learning the same basic content.  But there are a few problems:\n\n1. Many times, a child can get the correct answer using the \"old methods\" and be told they're wrong.  Their process is not common-core approved, and therefore it's no longer about mastering the concept, it's about mastering the teaching method.  This is a problem, because it teaches children that independant thinking and different learning styles are wrong.  Critical thinking skills needs to be praised, not discouraged.\n\n2.  What happens when you want to help your kid with their homework, or teach them a new concept early (say, Multiplication in first grade)?  How do you do it without confusing them?  How do you tie it in to what they've already learned?\n\n3. Common core is meant to *learn* the concepts.  It cannot be used to *master* the concepts.  Old fashioned methods, such as memorizing your multiplication tables, can be used through Calculus.  Common Core cannot.  So you have to teach them twice anyway.  The emphasis on mastering concepts that do not translate to higher-level fields of study is a bit silly to me.\n\nEven further, and related to the three above issues, it's a terrible addition to the problem of \"No child left behind.\"  It forces students to slow down and not learn ahead.  This is fantastic for your slower or even average students.  This seriously cripples advanced students because it holds them back until the slower ones can catch up.  It pushes smarter children into private schools, because the public system won't support them properly.\n\nCommon core is great on paper, but until the government acknowledges that children are individuals that learn in different ways and at different speeds, instead of little carbon clone children, it will continue to be a problem in practice.","score":"523","subreddit":"gifs"}

Happy employees = more productivity. Conversely, if you're not a fit you could disrupt the culture there -\u0026gt; the other employees not as happy -\u0026gt; less productivity for the team. \n\nOur company hired someone who was moving to join. He came up for a happy hour, got drunk, and said some very violent things when he was drunk. The company fired him before his first day due to culture fit. It would have been unprofessional for the company to keep him employed after what he showed.\n\nIt sucks but I would inquire some more about it. Usually within a few hours means you did something drastically wrong. You may not have noticed if you did something that offended them that much.\n\n\u0026gt; I am not sure what to do regarding the situation or really what my options are at this point!\n\nThis depends on your job market, your desirability, and how much savings you have. It's a little secret that to actually get a better job and large salary raise you should take time off to job search full-time. Here's the reasoning why:\n\nNew employers are hoping you are full-time employed. This means the likelihood of you interviewing and getting multiple offers is less. If there are no competing offers, then you have less negotiating power. And if you're full-time employed looking for another job, you may make the leap to the first job you find in your search.\n\nI was in similar shoes to you in 2014. I was laid off after 3 days at a start-up. I was offered my old job back at my previous company. Instead I took a month off, had a mini vacation, then interviewed full time. Because I was able to get multiple job offers I took a job at a company I believed in. Then with the multiple job offers I was able to negotiate substantially higher.\n\nOnly do this if you're confident you can get multiple job offers within a reasonable amount of time.","score":"14","subreddit":"jobs"}

His parents were in a situation where my brother could devote full time to homeschooling. So for two years they did that (actually with both of their kids, not just the nephew).\n\nWith the one on one attention and the ability to spend extra time going over all the fundamentals again, he caught up, and excelled. They moved and decided to put them back in public school again for 8th grade. Testing done at that new school placed him in 9th grade math. A year ahead of other students his age. He's been top of his class ever since. He's on the robotics team, gone to the nationals once with that. Programs in C, Java, and some other robotic specific language I don't know.\n\nThe point is if you really want that for your child, the best thing you can do is spend the time.

Men are totally allowed to go into the women's restroom, and there are lots of legit reasons why they do (escorting a small child, for instance, or using a changing station in a place that doesn't have those in the men's room).  Sometimes it just happens on accident because a person wasn't paying attention.  Nobody cares.\n\nEdit: Despite the downvotes, this is still true.  Go look it up.  In most places the most that can happen is a trespassing charge if you are asked to leave and refuse.  Segregated bathrooms is a social convention that people just assume must have some legal backing.  There are exceptions, but for the most part it doesn't.  OSHA actually *forbids* employers from enforcing gendered bathrooms on employees.  The EEOC has similar stances.

Had our car stolen out of the parking lot. People above us smoking, management did nothing about it. 2 managers previous was actually fired / jailed for being in on the drug dealing and taking kickbacks. Gang tagged our parking lots, management did nothing to clean them up. The tenant after us applied for credit cards using our information and (we assume by the knock on our door and the letter we later got) was prosecuted by the postmaster general for mail fraud. Management at this complex later made smoking in ALL apartments ok. This is what impelled us to move out. Couldn't take it.\n\nUtah County, UT - name withheld:\n\nMaintenance man deals drugs. Manager does them. Another employee makes pickups at the office after hours. We've located a few other pickup / dropoff points. Has sexually assaulted a half dozen women, including my wife, who he groped while drunk. He lived on premise, but after complaints to the landlord was forced to move. It'd the 31st of May and we still have no air conditioning. In Utah. The office manager will fine people for things like smoking or not paying rent, but will not report it to management. Instead she cashes the checks and keeps the money. We had a major drug dealer busted her a year or so ago - those huge black trash bags full of them. We stopped counting after the third two armed load.\n\nWe had our rent raised and replied that some things needed to be fixed. They threatened to evict us instead of fixing them. I'd give more details but do not want to put my name on anything that could identify us.\n\nWe've reported problems with the management that we and other tenants have to the owner of the complex, who lives in California. He claims these obviously aren't problems (such as the air conditioning) because there is 100% occupancy. AMC paints a rosy picture and makes sure to dock their employees pay and punish them if they do not meet the promised numbers to they people for whom they manage these complexes.\n\nIt's a horrible business, AMC. None of their apartments anywhere have sane people say good things about them. But the owner of AMC itself, one Greg Wiseman, is impossible to contact. Their web site is extremely mum on anything useful for filing complaints and - as someone who has lived in a few of their apartment complexes - they really don't give a shit.

{"body":"One way to frame the tradeoff here might be to talk about where we draw the boundary of trust. Rust kind of tends to draw that line at function calls. If I write\n\n    let myvec = vec![1, 2, 3];\n    foo(\u0026amp;myvec);\n\nthen I can be certain, within the bounds of safe code, that `foo` doesn't change anything inside of `myvec`. I don't have to _think_ so hard about how `foo` was written, or whether I was drunk when I wrote it, because the type system limits how much harm it can do.\n\nBut of course, code _inside_ the current function can screw around with `myvec` as much as it wants. I could shadow it, like we're talking about here. Or even without shadowing it, I could _change it's type_ through inference by changing the type signature of `foo`. In general I do need to think about all the code in the function, when I'm changing any one part.\n\nIn general, I'm totally ok with that tradeoff. One function's worth of code is a reasonable amount to keep in my head at once. And factoring out code into smaller functions is a good way to make the type system do the thinking for me. You could say that one way to get the guarantee you want is to replace the `...` in your example with a single function call, which takes a shared reference to the variable you care about.","score":"23","subreddit":"rust"}

{"body":"When I was young-up until bendis run Iceman was my favorite character. Huge fan. I loved his light demeanor and constant joking. I really relate to him and out of no where Bendis made him gay, I could not read x men anymore. Is there anything wrong with being gay...absolutely not, but stop trying to retcon one of the straight characters to being gay to try and get a crowd to like you. For once, rather than change a character that is already established, make someone a badass and be gay. It's not like gay ppl can't be cool. Bendis and Marvel as a whole have not figure out how to make someone gay actually stick and be cool. Maybe it's because the average reader isn't gay. Maybe it's because most of the series that we have now are over 40 years old. I know it's hard to make it in this business, but none of this is an excuse to make Iceman gay. That is my unpopular opinion. ","score":"25","subreddit":"xmen"}

She was beautiful, witty, and\ngraceful young woman who light was snuffed out far too early.\n\nI frequently fantasize about being Peter van Pels hiding with her.\n\n \n\nOh god, just imagine deﬂowering that sweet girl on a lazy Amsterdam\nafternoon, lying and learn what each other‘s bodies were for.\n\nNow imagine nine months later, she's got a massive bulging stomach from carrying your child inside of her and it seems like she's gonna pop any moment now. Her popped belly button makes it look like she's got a giant third boob where her stomach once was. She waddles around and can barely move half of the time. She's developed an insatiable craving for your dick and you've likewise developed a taste for her pussy. You're both cooped up in an attic all day have nothing better to do besides fuck like an unsustainable third world population. You lie down on your back, she strips off her almost comically too small clothes and kneels on top of you. She grabs a hold of your rock hard cock, inserts it deep inside of her, and begins to ride you like a stallion. You feel the pressure from her incredible weight and huge round belly bearing down on you but the indescribable pleasure of her tight pussy\nthrobbing on you cock negates any discomfort. You sink into her beautiful soul, into that secret place where no one dares to go. After 30 minutes, you and her are both moaning with ever greater intensity, you know it won't be long now. Suddenly, you feel your cock shaking like a V-2 rocket and the orgasm reaches it's climax as your cum\nliterally explodes like an 88mm AT round inside her Sherman tank, blowing the tunet right off. You and her both join as one, souls screaming from the sheer ecstasy. As the elation wears off, she lies next to you. Too exhausted to do anything else, you simply hold her in your embrace. In that moment, there is no family squabbles, no Nazis, no war. Just you and her, watching the sky turn pink with the setting sun.\n\n","score":"54","subreddit":"4chan"}

{"body":"He's gotta be one of the most creative carry players in the world. When I saw the new S\u0026amp;Y my first thought was that it's just no longer good on ranged heroes. Then here comes Hao, who builds it on a Gyrocopter of all things, and kicks ass with it.\n\nEDIT: I'm being downvoted and it's probably too late to do anything about that, but I guess I'll explain why I was surprised by the S\u0026amp;Y pick-up. I know the item is an absolute classic on Gyro, but remember that both it and Sange was nerfed heavily on ranged heroes for 6.87, greatly reducing the Maim slow (from 32% to 13%). As a result you see a lot of ranged cores foregoing the item now. Hao had already built a Yasha, and seeing as he was up against a DP, I figured he was going to build a Manta Style to dispel the silence and ensure he could get Calldown and Rocket Barrage off. I also thought he was gonna go for the very traditional Gyro build: Butterfly, MKB and Satanic, and probably a Skadi along the way. He *did* go Skadi, but only after picking up S\u0026amp;Y. After thinking about it, I think I can definitely see his logic now. As Godz said during the match, his build was the \"let's kite Sven for days\" build: Skadi for the slow, Dragonlance for increased distance, then the S\u0026amp;Y simple for additional slows unto Sven. Even with the reduced Maim slow, it still synergized a hell of a lot with Hao's other items and general strategy: that is, slowing down Sven while they dealt with the rest of the team, isolating the Sven and taking him down last.\n\nMaybe this was instantly obvious to everyone else, and probably I'm just terrible at this game, but I still thought it was a pretty clever pick-up. It wasn't just an automatic S\u0026amp;Y purchase, but instead one that was designed to deal with the single greatest threat on the enemy team, and for that I can definitely see the value.","score":"-13","subreddit":"DotA2"}

{"body":"I only played a few hours I will just make a list since its easier to read and not a wall of text to read through. I played on the PC and only the singleplayer if that helps anyone. I am also a HUGE fan of the brutal doom mod and always loved the Doom games.\n\n**What I liked:**\n\n* The game is definitely fast and you can find upgrades to be even faster.\n\n* Its gory but not too over the top where you are rolling your eyes. I feel like its in the perfect place of gore.\n\n* You will fight a lot of enemies in levels.\n\n* Options to turn off boss health bars, the glory kill glowing enemies and etc. \n\n* Levels are somewhat large some are linear, some have a lot of jumping or higher reaching areas, a lot of vertical gameplay is most of them,  and I think all of of them have secrets to explore and find and some secrets are cleverly hidden. Levels are definitely meant to be replayed.\n\n* Game is hard even on the medium setting. It never feels overwhelming where the game is cheating. You are OP as hell but enemies hit hard you need to keep moving around killing shit or you will die. \n\n* Can't regen health by standing still. Its either picking up health packs or glory kills on enemies (also seems like normal shooting kills drop health and ammo as well)\n\n* Enemies react where you shoot them. You can shoot arms or legs off and perform different glory kills from where you are looking. \n\n\n* Berserk power up is so goddamn satisfying. \n\n\n* Weapon mods are neat and you can swap them on the fly. For example the shotgun can either launch a grenade, or be charged for a 3-round burst. You just hit a button and it swaps out what you had.\n\n* On the PC you can switch weapons on the fly no weapon wheel slowdown. \n\n**Some things I am meh on:**\n\n* Upgrade system seems odd for this game. On one hand all upgrades are mostly from either killing shit a certain way or just finding them hidden in a level. My main issue is you need to upgrade ammo count and early game its frustrating to only have a max ammo capacity for a shotgun and its only 20 shells.\n\n* Some of the music is hit and miss.\n\n* Maybe I have mental issues or something but when you die in lava you give a Terminator 2 thumbs up as you die. I don't know why but it bothered me. Maybe I am one of those try hard single player guy but I just felt eh about it. \n\n* Half-Life 2 like cutscenes are really hit and miss for me. At times I like that its not a cutscene and I am in control but its very jarring from running around jumping climbing towers dodging balls of literal hell fire to go to a small room with someone talking to you. \n\n* For the PC the mouse sensitivity is really low and feels sluggish. You got to change them in the options menu. I made it more sensitive and it works fine now.\n\n\n**The bad:**\n\n* Checkpoints and no ability to quick save. This has to be addressed sooner than later. Some checkpoints are TERRIBLE. It sucks since some secret areas are in hard to reach areas and if you die you might have to restart the entire room again. Last night I cleared a room and went into another room got killed the last checkpoint was right before the first room was cleared its so annoying. \n\n* Low default ammo count. I know I mentioned this with the upgrade system but seriously max ammo in the beginning is so bad. I am not sure why they want to punish players for wanting to shoot in a shooting game.\n\n* Chainsaw feels like a missed opportunity for fun. Its a cool weapon usually a one shot kill but it just plays a little death animation while you are cutting enemies. I feel like I was suppose to control the saw and make my own cuts (similar to what the shadow warrior remake did kind of) but instead its all controlled by the game.\n\n* I feel like the imp redesign is silly looking but thats just me.\n\n* While you can turn off the glory kill orange and blue notifications its still a part of the game. Glory kills are not terrible they are fast paced and won't really take away from your enjoyment except one thing stunned enemies. Its a little weird seeing imps or demons from hell to be stunned by you waiting for you to kill them with a brutal punch or whatever.\n\n* ~~higher difficulty levels(like Nightmare) are locked~~ Ultra nightmare is locked until you beat the game. Some might not like it.\n\n* Some may not like this (I don't mind it honestly) there are waypoints on the map and a hud above you to show you where to go. I actually needed to use it once or twice because some levels really are bigger than your normal FPS level.  \n\n\nOverall though I like the game. Its definitely closer to the original Doom games than Doom 3 ever was (I like Doom 3 its just not a fast paced doom) It has some hiccups like the auto save and low default ammo pool but I am happy with it. I haven't tried the snap map yet I hope that doesn't rule out modding on the PC but I am eager to see what the more creative people can do with it. \n\nTL;DR: Its basically doom re imagined for 2016, it has some issues but overall a fun fast paced game.

Before you all hate on a religion, think about all the horrible, genocidal antics that your country's extreme parties have caused during the inception of your sovereign nations. America based on terror and the \"master/slave\" system, their lie that they call thanks giving, based on the genocide of native Americans, their rape and pilliging of women and children and Britain's imperial reign on a 6th of all the land in the world including many other world changing events the British monarchy has caused through the most horrific means, even now the west continues to spread lies in their media and dominate the world with terror and threats of terror on their own people by \"terrorists\" when we all know who was behind 9/11 where all this bulls hit started, yeah, thanks Bush, it's safe to say that this along with America's nazi style \"patriot act\" has thrown fuel on the fire of America's xenophobia and closed off culture (and effectively spilled over in to British society because america and the uk are basically holding hands to the toilets) \"guns,god,and more guns and freedom\"  to say that someone who married a 13 year old 1400 years ago is wrong is fair in today's society but throughout Europe and the British islands during the same time, sex with minors was common with it even being a rites of passage, now its pretty rich coming from America to make fault of a country's sovereign or religious history, who tried to split the country in to two separate states in order to keep their slaves (confederacy anyone? It may be heritage for you, if your family kept slaves) basically most of the people here who have these opinions are probably copying and pasting them straight from fox news or BBC news, daily mail reading motherfuckers, and just so you know, you can research all of the points in this statement.

Women are trying to get the best trade they can in the sexual marketplace. If you are an asshole or dismissive of her, it makes her think that you have more and better options than her because if she was your best option, you'd be submissive and deferential by constantly kissing her ass and complimenting her. That is (a reason) why women love assholes and guys who mistreat them, those behaviors are signs that a particular woman isn't important to a man, which is a sign that the guy has other and better options. \n\nWomen give men advice on what makes women's lives better, not on what makes men's lives better. \n\nFor people saying comments like this do not belong in MGTOW, you are wrong.

{"body":"\u0026gt;Women start out with everything, that's their downfall. **They get to 15** grow a pair of tits and suddenly everything is handed to them.\n\nWith a lot of them, it begins much MUCH earlier -- *Daddy's \"Little Princess\"* often gets **whatever** it is that she wants...\n\nHell these days, the \"spoiling\" often begins even before the child is *born* -- there's not only a whole nursery/bedroom but a \"playroom\" filled with virtually every toy and stuff doll imaginable and etc. -- all prepped and ready months in advance.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's not to mention the insane levels that some \"daddies\" go to in order to make the childhood of their precious little \"special snowflake\" daughter just *perfect* -- the merest whim becomes a multi-thousand dollar home remodel project.  I remember a wile back seeing some thread over under /r/DIY about some guy who's daughter had rather casually mentioned that she thought it would be \"neat\" to have like a \"tree-house\" in her bedroom, a place where she could read her books, play, etc.  The dad went WAAAAY overboard; built some steel-reinforced and plasti-coated-concrete super life-like \"tree\" (we're talking 2 to 3 foot in diameter \"100 year old oak tree\" sized trunk) with roots extending across half the floor and branches with leaves and lights and shit going across the ceiling, etc, etc.\n\nThe thing is, I'd be willing to bet **what the daughter ACTUALLY had in mind** was probably more like [some plastic \"PlaySkool\" style thing](https://softsculptedfoamtuffstuff.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/tree-dscf3173.jpg) or possibly even just [some cardboard \u0026amp; colored construction paper \u0026amp; marker thing (take the linked thing and scale it up with bigger cardboard)](http://familysponge.com/giveaway/giveaway-make-a-cardboard-treehouse/) that she would have a hand in creating, and would have been JUST as pleased with (possibly MORE).\n\nWhat she got instead was something that a movie-set crew would have a hard time replicating. EDIT: [found the thread \u0026amp; imgur gallery](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/420wu0/i_built_a_tree_in_my_daughters_bedroom/). **EDIT2 Link at left fixed.**\n\nAnd the thing is -- if daddy was some bazillionaire (aka Paris Hilton or something) then it might be understandable, I mean the kid would grow up spoiled and the heir to a massive trust fund fortune anyway, right?  But in this case the guy's actually a lower-middle class guy and this was a MAJOR expense for the household \u0026amp; family (just for the materials, etc -- not counting all of insane number of extra hours he put into it himself).\n\nSo he's succeeded in become \"alpha\" in the eyes and life of a child-female... but he's unwittingly fucked her up for life\\*; because NOW her level of expectation is... well it's going to be so insanely high that no one and nothing else are likely to *ever* match up with this.\n\n--\nDumb dumb dumb.\n\n--\n\nWhat COULD have been a nice and simple (and cheap) little exercise for him to teach his daughter how to \"craft\" something she wants herself -- how to DO the work to create her own \"fun\" -- with her *actively* participating in if not doing the lion's share of the work (again some cardboard or paper-mache thing -- something at or maybe slightly above her present-age skill-level in terms of crafts would have been MORE than what she'd imagined/wanted).  \n\nBut nope he had to go all \"X-Treme Home Makeover TV Show\" style -- and never mind that he actually probably torpedoed his home's resale value -- and that his precious little princess will soon enough grow SICK of having a fucking massive concrete \"tree\" in her room (heck she literally will probably no longer \"fit\" in it for more than a year or two, she'll grow too big to use it).\n\n---\n\n\\* I've seen what happens to little girls who have fathers that do these kinds of things for their \"special little princess\" -- even things that are much LESS \"grandiose\" than this -- and invariably they end up as unhappy, selfish, spoiled bitches with no direction in life, *frequently* they end up basically playing \"hooker/mistress\" to some rich-guy sugar daddy during their 20's, have half a dozen abortions, contract STD's and get addicted to drink \u0026amp; drugs, and then once their \"used up\" they return home to be a fat-depressed parasite living with \u0026amp; off of their REAL \"daddy\" again as they hit their mid-to-late 30's or early 40's (when they can no longer GET a \"sugar daddy\" -- because what rich guy wants a used-up drug addicted, fat, wrinkled \u0026amp; slutty worn out whore... when you can find some young eager \"freaky-sexy\" college girl in a snap... aka the next \"little princess\" that some other \"daddy\" has created).","score":"17","subreddit":"MGTOW"}

{"body":"Tales from the industry time! A record label I worked with had some artists who had put out a song that was a minor hit. They were approached by Island/Def Jam about writing a song for Justin Beiber, and the executives stressed they wanted something very similar to the minor hit these artists had out at the time. They ended up not doing it due to schedule restrictions, but a few months later, Justin drops 'Baby'. Now, lyrically the song is fairly similar to these artist's minor hit, but the synth lines are almost exactly the same....they're not prominent, so it doesn't sound like a total rip-off in a side-by-side comparison, but to the more discriminating ear, there are lots of sonic similarities. They have their lawyers write a little letter to Scooter Braun, who promptly calls them up and tells them he'll blackball them in the industry and destroy the entire record label if they even consider trying to associate 'plagiarism' with Justin Beiber. Somehow, they managed to resolve the issue amicably.\n\nHere's the thing, though: The Dream wrote Baby....these artists reckon the Island executives they had met with previously probably played him their song as an example of what they were looking for, and then The Dream had it in his head when he was making Baby, and the synths ended up being the same on accident. It happens. Artists hear things in their head and may not realize they've heard it from something else....remember when Bob Dylan was accused of plagiarizing some book about Japanese Yakuza? There's a word for the phenomena, but I forget what it is. \n\nTotally possible *julia michaels* had heard that song at some point and unwittingly appropriated the beginning and used it for Sorry....so what, though?

Most of the time if somebody's just going to be on a show once, you don't get completely obsessed with the character, but I loved the mystery of [him].\n\n\u0026gt;He was supposed to be the most handsome, charming, mysterious, every superlative you can possibly have, [guy], and I met a million people. I would say I auditioned three hundred guys, for one scene basically. We actually found a couple of people that [we thought], \"We're shooting tomorrow, this will be fine.\"\n\n\u0026gt;I kept saying to Joss, let me have a few more hours, and he was like, \"Fine, but we have people, don't drive yourself crazy.\" Out of the blue, a friend of mine called, who I knew as a producer in the independent film world, and he said, \"I know what you're looking for, and there's this guy I see walking his dog outside my window. I don't know what his story is, but I think you should meet him.\" I said \"Yeah, send him in.\"\n\n\u0026gt;He walked in the room, and I looked up and wrote next to his name, \"This is the guy.\" He never even opened his mouth. We just chatted for a while. He told me where he was from, we talked about italian food.\n\n\u0026gt;I said, \"Wait here,\" I ran down the hall and I said to Joss, \"I've found the guy.\" He did that one episode, and the rest is history.\n\n\n____________________\n\n\u0026gt;[David Boreanaz has his dog to thank for his career](http://www.smokemag.com/0308/cover.htm), a fact he absolutely confirms from his California home while on a writers’ strike scheduled holiday—kind of. “Well, that helped kind of push the career along. I mean, that is a true story; I was walking my dog and a talent scout saw me on the street. Then from there, I got my manager, which led to me getting my first acting jobs.”\n\n\u0026gt;See, it was his dog. And while it may be ability that has sustained his career through three hit TV series, it was the fact that his dog needed some exercise one day that first got David’s toes in the industry door. Also, destiny wasn’t hurt by the fact he and his dog were walking in a cosmopolitan urban center where open-minded attitudes extend to the street level, dog-walking circuit. “He was trying to pick me up.

{"body":"All credibility gone because of a spelling mistake? Like because this guy used the wrong word you don't believe him?\n\nCongratulations, you're a pedantic asshole.\n\nEDIT: So I'm getting a lot of flak from this for some reason so I wanted to clear up a few things, and though it's inevitably going to result in more downvotes because that's how reddit works, it doesn't really matter because it's something important that I think needs to be said, especially in this Information Age where a large portion of our human interaction is through text.\n\nMisspelling something, misspeaking something, mispronouncing something or generally getting things mixed up sometimes does not make you matter less as a person. People make mistakes all the time, even really intelligent people, and in the real world where everyone is expected to have at least a modicum of courtesy toward each other, people generally let those things go and get on with their day. \n\nThe anonymity of reddit and the internet in general can (and often does) bring out the best and the worst of people, and while correcting people's grammar or spelling is on the more innocuous side of things, insulting them or disrespecting them because of it is deplorable. \n\nWriting is a learned skill, not an innate one, and it's a skill that (for whatever reason) people are never really able to get a good grasp on. These are skills that are taught to you during your most formative years, and trauma or other extenuating circumstances (like trouble at home et cetera) can really effect your ability to learn during that time. The best thing to do is respectfully inform them of their mistake, and if they decide to be ignorant and ignore your advice, then it's their problem.\n\nBasic literacy is a very important thing that you can't get very far without in today's society. But if you've attained a level of competency that allows others to understand what you're trying to express in text (which is an actual problem that some people have, but the post in question here isn't anywhere near that), it doesn't really matter beyond that. Yes, proper grammar and spelling is a useful tool for being understood and taken seriously but it isn't necessary at all times, and no one should look down on you for not practicing it when it doesn't count (like on reddit). Some people just can't wrap their head around it and that's okay. Someone could mix up their, they're and there, then turn around and disassemble and reassemble a car engine. People have different skillsets, get over it.\n\nFor instance take [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4kallo/what_is_the_saddest_detail_about_your_life_that/d3dtvau) from [this askreddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4kallo/what_is_the_saddest_detail_about_your_life_that/). I hope that /u/newadventure2015 doesn't mind me using them as an example, but in their post, which is attempting to offer comfort to a fellow redditor suffering from suicidal ideation and depression, they use the 'your' in the place of 'you're'. Does this make /u/newadventure2015's genuine act of human kindness any less sincere? Does it invalidate their own feelings or any of the things they went through because they misused a word, once, in an otherwise solidly constructed post? Of course not. To imply otherwise would be incredibly disrespectful. Though shit like that happens on reddit all the time, for a multitude of reasons I'm sure, but it's still not cool. Rule number one is don't be a dick, and criticizing others for their grammar is where a lot of people fail to live up to said rule.\n\ntl;dr: Even the most intelligent among us make mistakes, not everyone learns the same way, don't be dicks about it","score":"-35","subreddit":"funny"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; Nobody regards Ramdev or Asaram as intellectuals. And Congress lovers like this intellectual IAS officer should note Asaram Bapu was patronized by Digvijay Singh when Congress ruled Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThat's a huge generalisation *and* a distortion of what this officer said. There is a sizeable populace that looks upto such people as 'intellectuals' - (Ayurvedic) Science and Philosophy. If I read the officer's post correctly, he was ranting against this mentality.\n\nI also did not detect any Congress-love in his post. Though it is quite possible that you have access to his FB feed and your detector went off. And then, there is also the question of - if so, what is wrong with it? If BJP/RSS love be okay (for a whole host of public servants these days - bureaucrats and other officers), this should be okay just as well. The reason for mentioning this is the way you have constructed your sentence - you've made it sound almost treasonous/traitorous.\n\n\u0026gt; Whatever this IAS officer's personal and political views, he should have kept it to himself instead of coming out of indulging in political games while still in service.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, it was his private space. Unless FB is the new public platform. And one fails to understand what 'political games' are being played here. He has a right to criticise the ideological stance of a particular political dispensation - which he did, in his private capacity.\n\n\u0026gt; Nehru has gotten his due and then some; it's not like renaming some of the HUNDREDS of buildings and government schemes in his name is going to mean everyone will forget him. Don't worry, there's still 299 buildings left!\n\nWhat is due to Nehru lies not in the naming and re-naming of buildings (and universities). There is the question of his legacy and his contribution which needs be acknowledged by people. The fact that the INC, since his passing, has served to capitalise on that in ways that are far from savoury is no reason to distort the same. And there is this entire cabal (BJP IT Cell?) that serves up distortions and peddles half-truths to take away the value of such legacy/contribution. \n\nWhile it may be politically expedient to do so, in the interests of robbing the INC (as it stands today) of its much used and abused platform for wide social appeal, it is distasteful, dishonourable and unmindful of the consequences - a few generations are now being raised with a perverse view of what Nehru was and did.

Passport Service\n - everything is available online, no agents are required and information is very clear and to the mark.\n - You choose options for the questions they ask to determine what documents will be required, and then they display final list of documents and also mention in detail what each document means to avoid any confusion.\n - You select the time and reach there 15 minutes before the given time, you are out in 30 minutes.\n - before the scheduled time, you are sent an sms as a reminder.\n - once passport process starts, you are sent status update on it at regular intervals.\n - a friend experienced all of it.\n\n3. IT Job Opportunities (you can also argue endless here, but I am mentioning first hand experience here):\n - The amount of startups we are seeing now a days was never seen before. Earlier, right here on /r/india we used to discuss that India needs a startup environment, now that it is here, people are trying to point at problems at that, but it is here.\n - My understanding is that so many startups are coming up because funds are available in market and it is so because lot of weird laws are removed by modi government (one law was that for every funding to startup, government will tax 30% if the amount, that was so stupid, another law was that when acquisition happens, those getting their shares sold will have to pay 20% tax to government, another stupid law, good redundance).\n - this has created lot of job opportunities and that too with salary perks that weren't available before. \n\n4. Cleanliness:\n - I see roads, stations, streets cleaner than before. It could be due to citizens awareness or government efforts, but \"Swachcha Bharat Abhiyan\" surely has an impact on it.\n - It feels good to have cleanliness around, I cam not give exact measurement of this impact in terms of money.\n\n","score":"40","subreddit":"india"}

Basically everything feels hopeless and the two main characters are just cogs in this nightmare machine of a story.  I have no idea how Kouga can even function after the events with the party mansion, but he somehow moves past that.  Jin himself also keeps dealing with loss as well, but seems to keep picking himself up by the bootstrap.  Its been a couple of years since I last read it and the last thing I remember reading involved a corporate party getting ruined and Jin suffering another loss.  I won't get into specifics in case you plan on reading it.  Its a great story, just really really sad at times.","score":"18","subreddit":"manga"}

Story was always what SWTOR did well, better than anything else on the market, and it's nice to be able to play through an update for it every month. \n\nAs long as there are some other elements included in Season 2, like some FPs that tie in or maybe new types of instances for smaller groups, alongside a WZ or two, I think the game is better this way. \n\nIt's just one opinion, though. I'm tired of Operations and \"progression\". It's quite simply boring to me. If it is what you enjoy, there are games that are much better for it than SWTOR. It's strange that people would stick around for Operations/raids here, and even worse what the OP has outlined. Glad I learned HM mechanics before this stuff became more commonplace.\n\nAs to your last question, why pay an MMO sub for the current version of SWTOR? I like it, and $15 a month for the many hours I spend playing is worthwhile. I get there are other games that give the player more content, but I like SWTOR enough to still prefer it. \n\nFor people that like good raids/multiplayer PVE, I've read Final Fantasy is a good place to be, if not WoW. I thought Wildstar was basically built around challenging PVE endgame content, but apparently that completely failed to work in the current market and it is in maintenance.

Meaning he acted out the scene as if Hodor was in control of his actions in the exact moment he held the door. It's interesting to me how dismissive people are of the opinions and statements of the actors, directors, and writers of the show. Do people really think that a professional actor didn't ask the question of whether his character was or was not in control of his actions during that scene? That's a massively important thing for how that scene is acted, not just a nuance. Look at the emotion Hodor displays in that instance—now I could be wrong, but I simply do not ever remember him emoting like that when Bran warged him, he was much more blank and affectless. The acting in the scene to me suggests the the intention is absolutely that Hodor was in control of his actions when he held the door in that final moment of his life. Now sure, you can get into squabbles about intention in any text, but for a work like Game of Thrones I'm willing to accept the interpretation offered by those involved. \n\nThat being said, I am still very unclear on a lot of the mechanics of what went down in that scene and I do hope we'll receive further clarification soon, which I imagine we will. If Bran knowingly sacrificed Hodor there he'd be absolutely wracked by guilt, so it'd obviously be discussed.

{"body":"Thanks for your post. Refreshing to read about that here when people talk about basically 2 subjects and shit on all the others. As a Dany fan it's hard to find stuff about her here that I like to read because it looks like everything she does is wrong, but if done by other characters would be \"fantastic\". Take as an exemple the burning of the tent. If that was Jon in a pyre emerging unschated people here would have loved it. Or the last scene in the show. Although I agree the scene was misplaced, it was an important scene as they showed how she could finally control Drogon - rememeber the amount of shit she's gotten in the past years for not being able to control her dragons. When she does, it's easier to just attack.\n\nSame about many here finding that the only way her character will become interesting is if she becomes mad, like her father - wait, haven't we seen that before? It's like it's only interesting if happens \"what I want\". They keep making parallels of Dany and her father when one of the smartest characters of the book, Tyrion, compared her to Aegon the Conqueror, same GRRM, and same about comparing her to Nymeria. \n\nThese same people even say she gets everything handed, c'mon. She lost her family, hatching the dragons was all but her own fault, the idea of exchanging Drogon for an army was her idea, and now she won a big ass khalasar due to her own merits. She's naive about some stuff of course, like trying abruptly to end slavery, but that's because she cared for the folks. She had no training or experience, she wasn't raised to be a ruler but if nothing else, her failures should teach her a lesson. She's a conqueror at heart already, no doubt. If she'll be more than that? Time will tell. But with the biggest army in the World and with her Dragons, she's obviously an important piece in the war to come. I have hopes that when she finally makes it to Westeros, most people who despise her now will at least accept her, because she'll finally be immersed in the main story. \n","score":"20","subreddit":"asoiaf"}

Skyler never had a 30 minute monologue, or any lengthy monologue that I can recall (and I have watched the series 3+ times). She is often called a \"bitch\" by fans who don't actually understand the show because she cheats on her drug-dealing husband who she only sees for a few minutes each day, who has become a different person, who rapes her once early in the second season. She is advised to divorce him by her lawyer but she stays with him and keeps his secret. Toward the end of the show, her husband makes a phone call to her accusing her of never supporting him when it counted. I think some people may not realize that this was her husband caring for her and trying to keep her from being targeted by the police. He did not actually believe that his wife was not supporting him when he needed her, because she definitely did after she got used to his job.

{"body":"Some excerpts from the article: \n\n\"Officers in the Kawawachikamach First Nation, near Schefferville, responded to 64 suicide attempts in the last 12 months. In a community with a population of 850, that represents about one attempt for every 12 residents.\"\n\n\"Though the events in Kuujjuaq are an extreme and rare example, they serve as a reminder of the kind of danger that police in indigenous communities face.\n\nIn the territories they serve, residents live disproportionately in poverty, face overcrowded housing conditions and many struggle with addiction issues related to the legacy of Canada’s residential school system. Several officers interviewed by the Montreal Gazette say that police often bear the brunt of what they call Canada’s broken relationship with its aboriginal people.\n\n“A lot of these people are living in extreme poverty, many of them were abused in residential school or their parents were abused in residential school,” said one aboriginal police officer, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of professional reprisals. “They need access to mental health-care and they’re not getting it. They need access to clean drinking water and they’re not getting it. They need basic services and they’re not getting them.\n\n“Throw in substance-abuse problems and a housing crisis into the mix — three, sometimes four, generations living under the same roof — and you’ve got the perfect recipe for violence.”\n\nThere’s statistical evidence to back this claim. The crime rate in aboriginal communities is three times higher than the national average, according to Public Safety Canada.\"\n\n\"Police are also on the front lines of the suicide crisis that so many indigenous communities face.\n\nDuring one particularly disturbing intervention, Boreland and his partner kept a 13-year-old boy from killing himself.\n\n\"When we arrived at the scene, he was in the bathroom, with a noose around his neck,” Boreland said. “We didn’t have time to think. My partner braced his body up, and I rushed to cut the rope. It was unreal. It makes you wonder what these kids are going through and what you can do to help. It’s unsettling.” \"\n\nI don't understand how you could be gutless enough to peddle your racist agenda after reading through an article like this. Shame on you. ","score":"-12","subreddit":"canada"}

There were clowns in the show, and I think I laughed at a few of their jokes. \n\nWhen we were leaving I saw a clown selling balloons, the ones that are transparent with stars printed on them. I'd never seen these before, and I thought they were beautiful. I told my mom I wanted one, and she tried to get my attention on something else because they were something ridiculous like $10 each. I wouldn't budge though, so she made me a deal: I can have the balloon if I go pay for it, alone.\n\nShe knew I was an extremely shy kid, but I wanted that damn balloon, so I agreed to it.\n\nI walk up to the clown, and it isn't until I get there that I realize just how creepy he is. He's towering over me, with these skinny long legs. When I look up at his face, it's stuck in a permanent grin. At first he sounds cheerful when he asks me what I'd like to buy, but then as I stutter my words, his voice changes to an impatient tone. The kindness left his eyes.That smile was still on his face though, because it was part of the makeup. This mixture of expressions made him look sinister, like some kind of monster that was ready to snatch me up. \n\nI didn't get my balloon, and I've never liked clowns since.","score":"19","subreddit":"creepy"}

You would think they are good at tanking but they are not.\n\nWhat I would do is this: go back to town and get the NPC from the lost necklace quest. Yes the annoying one that sent you all over town to find it. He does crap dmg but he can take quite a few hits before going down.\n\nNow go back to the boss and start the encounter. Start dps SLOW! Let the NPC tank most of the dmg up until the first ground slam. He'll die but you should have the boss to about 1/2 health by then. If you don't, then you aren't strong enough yet to beat the boss. Level up some more and upgrade your gear.\n\nOK with me this far? Good, so after your NPC dies, you should be able to tank the boss the rest of the way. Use your heals if you must, but really you have to spend most of your mana on your best nuke to kill the boss before the enrage timer kicks in, in which case it's game over.\n\nOnce he gets under 25% he will start to do more ground slams more often. You need to DODGE these. He will always raise his head before doing a ground slam so you should be able to avoid them. \n\nOnce you get the dodging down pat, it's pretty much a tank and spank from there.

{"body":"Rant incoming, disregard if you like.\n\nPersonally, I thought the scale was fine and the lack of player agency was a complete non-issue, I'd have been fine with no choice at all. My problem with the ending is that it was fucking stupid.\n\nMass Effect was a game with an incredible level of detail and thought put into realism/immersion. I remember reading codex entries in ME1 and being blown away by the descriptions of ship-to-ship combat, alien physiology, the mass effect field physics of the guns, etc. And that \"Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space\" conversation? Brilliant!\n\nME3's ending tore to pieces, chewed up, and shat out what I loved most about the series. First, the starchild tells you that the Reapers were the solution to the impossibility of peace between organics and synthetics. What the fuck? I literally just brokered a truce between the Quarians and the Geth! We're supposed to blindly accept the assertion that peace is/was impossible (as the reason for the driving conflict of the entire trilogy!), despite this assertion being entirely unsubstantiated, and in fact blatantly contradicted by previous events.\n\nThen you get to the choices. Again, I had no problem with the scale or the basic idea of control, destroy, whatever. But to control the Reapers, I have to kill myself and assimilate my mind into the digital world? WHY?!? Starchild is already telling the Reapers what to do, why the fuck can't he just tell them to stop? Why can't ***I*** just tell them to stop? Where does killing myself come into this, except as an obvious game design \"trade off\" to keep control from being stand-out best choice?\n\nThen there's destroy, which is accomplished by shooting a pillar until it explodes. Okay...\n\n   ...wait what? The crucible was developed bit by bit over untold cycles *specifically to destroy* the Reapers, and it's activated by shooting a pillar until it explodes? Was a control panel too complex? Was a big red button just too damn cliche?\n\nAnd finally, you have synthesis. The ending where you get dissolved in an energy beam and then more energy beams shoot out across the universe and then synthetics magically gain some kind of organic attributes (and green glowy lines!) and organics magically gain synthetic attributes (and more green glowy lines!) and then everybody lived happily ever after. The most absurd, nonsense, black magic, lazily written deus ex machina I've ever seen.\n\nAnd that's why I hated ME3's ending. End rant.","score":"39","subreddit":"gaming"}

{"body":"It's a little far-fetched to be honest, but I like to apply the concept of a Dragon Break event in Fallout.\n\nA Dragon Break is where time is broken and becomes non-linear. In Fallout's case this occurs a little after World War II where nuclear power becomes very, very common. \n\nThis event creates two timelines, our's and Fallout's. After a Dragon Break occurs a lot of chaos happens, in the Fallout line the world is slowly torn apart by the Resource Wars, government corruption, and ultimately the Great War.\n\nIn Elder Scrolls terms this all happens in a kalpa, a time in which a world exists, when one kalpa is ended another world is formed.\n\nThis is where it gets a little tricky, the Children of Atom believe that there are hundreds of world's within them and want to achieve Division, where everything is destroyed and all those worlds within them are released.\n\nWhile you can easily apply this is simply misundestanding what atoms *actually are*, it can also be viewed that they want to bring an end to this Kalpa in order to bring about the next. Alduin is Atom in this case.\n\nIn the end the Children suceeds, the world is destroyed, and the kalpa ends, beginning the next kalpa and the Elder Scrolls Universe.\n\nThere's a bit more to it, but that's my basic theory.\n\nI know it's complicated and *probably not true*, but I like to think it is.\n\nI have another theory where I believe the Thalmor are trying to bring about Landfall (the end of the Elder Scrolls kalpa) by deactivating a bunch of Towers holding up the mortal realm using bugs in jars, but I think that theory is better discussed at /r/ElderScrolls.","score":"82","subreddit":"gaming"}

The things they're saying about them are so muddled and non-specific that it doesn't seem like an applicable strategy at all.\n\nLSV says that the two-drops that are relevant in the lategame are \"all just good cards.\" Well, that's most of the two-drops in the format. There are 25 non-rare two-drops, and 14 of them have good activated or triggered abilities, delirium bonuses, deathtouch, or evasion. I would be happy to draw any of those on turn eight. And that's being conservative, that's not even including cards like the Kessig Forgemaster that LSV happily second-picked in the crack-a-draft or de-facto two drop removal spells like Dead Weight. And then he says that vanilla 2/2s and 2/1s aren't good... well, those aren't cards. Are we just speculating about how bad cards that don't exist in the format would be if they did exist? There is no Grizzly Bears. The only cards I can imagine he's talking about are Furtive Homunculus and Devilthorn Fox, and sure, those two individual cards out of the 25 are not good, I can agree with that. But then Marshall specifically named both of those cards as cards he happily plays in his \"best deck in the format.\"\n\nLikewise they say it's not a format where if you don't have a two you're dead and then they complain about two-drop werewolves flipping when you miss your two drop leading to non-games. You know how you prevent those non-games? Drafting and playing your two-drops highly. What are we even talking about? What is this format where you're encouraging people to play Hinterland Logger and Quilled Wolf and then on the other hand saying that you don't need to have the ability to block these good cards that everyone should play? If Ghoulcaller's Accomplice isn't a playable card why are we fourth picking it in the crack-a-draft? The two decks each host named as the best in the format were GW (including human-based aggro) and UW (playing Devilthorn Foxes and trying to damage race), but somehow this isn't a format where you need to be playing blockers on turn two? There's no consistency to the message at all.\n\nI guess maybe what they're trying to get across is \"this format isn't as aggressive as Zendikar or Magic Origins,\" but if so they really need to phrase it in a more reasonable way, because if I didn't have pretty strong opinions about the format myself I feel like I would just be getting incredibly confused by this whole discussion.","score":"27","subreddit":"lrcast"}

Esos likes se los suelen dar a one-liners sarcásticos o apáticos que intentan ser graciosos, mientras que post bien elaborados no reciben nada de atención. Imagínate que eres un usuario nuevo y lo primero que ves es que a la gente le da \"weba\" leer post elaborados y le dan \"likes\" a los one-liners, obviamente no vas a gastar tu tiempo elaborando tampoco. \n\nSi ustedes se dan un viaje a diferentes subs van a poder encontrar que hay reglas bien claras sobre cómo usar los votos dependiendo de la temática del sub. En lo personal me parece que si es un sub de convivencia u opinión los Downvotes no son necesarios (se puede tener un sub sin downvotes), no es como si el sub necesitara darle downvotes a la siguiente clase de personas que sí son presentes en otros subs: Estafadores, hackers, FUDsters, sockpuppets, shills, etc. Es decir si la idea de r/Mexico es de carácter de opinión e información general, usar los downvotes como dislikes ni siquiera tiene sentido, es como: \"pos si me caga le doy bajivoto\", \"Si ese wey me cae mal, orale bajivoto para que se le baje\" (de hecho está bien chistoso cuando veo un comentario y una respuesta ambos con 0 votos, es obvio que se dieron bajitovotos entre ellos porque se cayeron mal lol).\n\nEn fin, *mi opinión* es que *si quieren* un sub menos apático, modifiquen las reglas sobre los votos y de ser necesario eliminen los downvotes, si no pues... así siganle.

Con la paulatina mejoría de la economía estadounidense y la leve alza de tasas de la FED, ese capital golondrino esta saliendo del país y regresando a EEUU, por mas que Banxico suba en proporción las tasas, el simple factor riesgo USD vs MXN va a hacer que siga saliendo ese capital del país. \n\nAhora, un peso \"débil\" no es necesariamente malo aunque la chairiza diga que si, eso incentiva inversión, sobre todo en el sector manufacturero el cual es el principal motor de la economía en México.\n\nSi, es una patada en las bolas que ahora ir a EEUU o comprar productos importados sea mas caro, pero no es el caso de la mayoría del país.\n\nPara mantener el TC a cierto precio, se debe inyectar dinero al mercado cambiarlo, es decir, el gobierno debe intervenir, por historia y simplemente viendo a países que lo hacen/hicieron (Argentina hasta hace poco, México defendiendo el peso como perro y  Venezuela coff) lo único que eso ocasiona es una espiral inflacionaria y en el mediano y largo plazo, una crisis.\n\nTL;DR Nada, no es culpa de México per se, el dolar va a estar entre 17 y 20 lo que resta del año asi que no te espantes","score":"18","subreddit":"mexico"}

He goes off to fight the bad guy who's got a bigger, better, badder suit, but that's not enough.  They need to up the tension more.  What do they do?  They pre weaken Iron Man by forcing him to use the original arc reactor that has serious power limitations and isn't meant for extended flight.  Now Tony is fighting the bigger, better, badder Iron Monger and he isn't even at full strength.  I get why that works from a dramatic stand point but man does it serve to make the bad guy look useless when the hero wins.  \n\nIn TFA we have the heroes armed, healthy, and ready for a fight.  And the only reason they even had a chance to survive was because the bad guy was already on the ropes from being shot.  And they still barely made it, even while Kylo was toying with them most of the time.  One of them even ends up in a coma!

{"body":"Allow me to chime in, former cable company employee (Comcast)\n\nOrange cables like that are meant to be temporary. Basically what needs to happen is a trench needs to be dug to sufficient depth, the old underground line removed, a new one laid down, and the ground put back. Before that can happen, a number of things need to occur. \n\nFirst is the ground has to be soft enough and dry enough to dig. If it's still frost-hard from winter (unlikely in most of the US but I don't know where you are) they cannot dig. If it's too wet, they won't dig because you don't want mud everywhere.\n\nThen, assuming weather is good, all relevant underground utilities MUST be contacted and do mark-outs to make sure no one hits anything when digging. This applies to power, gas, water, telephone, sprinkler and alarm systems, and some others. Once contacted they are (in most states) required by law to send someone out within usually 24-48 hours to mark their lines. You would know this happened because your lawn would be full of spraypaint or flags.  \n\nThen, once that's all in place and assuming the weather holds, they bury the new line. Usually takes a few hours under reasonable conditions.\n\nNow, that said, this entire process should generally never be more than 2 weeks unless weather or a third party mark out is holding them up. I'd be curious as to what the reason for the hold up is. There might be a good one (I've seen a couple of these take months before) but there might not.","score":"228","subreddit":"videos"}

Mom gets bit but they don't know that is what causes people to turn, radio says its some sort of virus, but they don't know how it spreads.\n\n35 minutes(0:55) Driving looking for safety. They hear on the radio that there are three safe locations that the army is telling everyone to go to. \n\n10 minutes (1:05) Accident scene. Mom is driving. She begins to fall asleep. The dad is too distracted trying to find the best way to the next possible safe location to notice. She falls asleep and they go off the road. Down a hill and into the woods. The dad wakes up, sees the mom has turned. He gets bit, gets out goes back for the kid. The mom is about to eat the baby like a dingo. Dad kills the mom with a rock. Gets the baby, puts the baby in the baby-backpack thing and starts walking.   \n\n25 minutes (1:30) Wandering. Dad sees a soldier hanging from a parachute in a tree. He's dead, but not a zombie. He's legless corpse sways gently side to side as a small group of zombies patiently follow, his bloodied stumps just out of reach. The baby makes a noise. the dad stands still paralyzed with fear when some of the distracted zombies turn towards him. After a tense stare down, and just before one of the zombies takes a step, the corpse begins to sway back, drawing the dead away. This inspires the dad. \n\n15 min (1:45) The dad continues to talk, he gets the stick and the bag of meat. \n\n15 min (2:00) Final scene, he's approaching a compound, hes turned but just like in the short, we don't see him turn. A sniper on a high position spots him, but doesn't realizes he has turned. She looks at his face and sees the bag of meat on a stick. Shes still not certain that hes turned, but shes pretty sure. She gets ready to take the shot but then she sees the baby. A voice over the radio tells her to take the shot. She looks up from her scope and grabs the radio to respond about the baby, but a shot rings out. A man on the ground fired. The sniper looks down her scope and sees the man on the ground. She runs from the position, yelling for a doctor. She gets down to the man, she looks in the kid-backpack and sees it empty. She looks up and sees the dude who shot the dad, holding the baby. \n-fin","score":"39","subreddit":"videos"}

{"body":"But that's entirely missing the point of the trailer. If you know the original score of the game, you were going to see this movie regardless of the trailer music. Trailers are made very precisely, with many different versions produced by different companies. They test the trailers, often with different music choices, with focus groups, and release the ones that test the best. \n\nThese focus groups are made up of people with nothing better to do on a Tuesday who happened to be in a mall in Carson, CA or somewhere like that. They aren't gamers, they aren't film buffs, they are just normal, largely uninformed, people. With the Kanye beat playing under it, this has a more modern feel and conveys a cool action movie aesthetic. With the game's original score, it conveys more of a historical period piece feel. \n\nIt's not about getting us to like it. It's about getting moms in Kansas to look up from their phone during the trailers before *Mother's Day*. For these types of films, bold music choices that are in opposition to the type of film being shown test super well (Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Suicide Squad, tons more). \n\nThe goal of the trailer isn't to make a cool short film. It's to expose as wide an audience to the concept of the film as possible. This song accomplishes that. ","score":"168","subreddit":"videos"}

Antpool in the past April have only 1 orphaned block, which is an evidence that there is no selfish mining situation----a selfish mining attack will generate higher orphan rate on both competitors and attackers. On the https://poolbench.antminer.link/, you can find that the performance of a mining pool.

If you just realized right now, that the communication problem inside Core, you cannot blame anyone else. We will not active the SegWit until seeing the promised (by \"individuals\" yes I know Maxwell could not be represented.) HF code being released in Bitcoin Core. If everything is progressed according the HK Consensus, the SegWit will not be stalled. The SegWit as a very through improvement/change will need to be carefully tested and reviewed after its release, at least for several months. During which time the HF can be proposed, defined, implemented and released. While the max blocksize limit lifting can be activated later, but as the code is already contained in the release, most of the economic nodes in the network will be compatible with the coming blocksize bumping up.\n\nBitcoin is a worldwide economy infrastructure and it requires working together and moving forward.  Greg, you need to have some self control from talking like a human flesh fascist propaganda machine, trying to attack anyone who disagree with you.\n\nPlease don't tag those concerns as \"pro-altcoin\".

{"body":"99.99999% of a pitchers ERA is in their control. That's why it's called EARNED run average. The variance in defensive across MLB is so minuscule, it really comes down to ERA being the most accurate measure of a pitchers performance. And Arrieta's has been half of Kershaw's. And Arrieta gives up weaker contact on average, and he has fewer H/9, a lower OBPA, a lower BAA, etc. \n\nThe only thing Kershaw has is K/BB. Strike Outs are only important in two circumstances: 1. To predict a pitcher's future success (i.e. If people miss the ball more often then they are less likely to string hits together and score runs). But Arrieta still has great SO numbers himself, even if they aren't as high as Kershaw's. And 2. With runners in scoring position, a strike out helps limit damage/ get you out of jams. But given the fact that Arrieta gives up less than one run per 9 IP compared to Kershaw's 1 1/2 runs per game, it's safe to say Arrieta isn't even in those jams with RISP to begin with. \n\nNot to mention the two no hitters....","score":"-4","subreddit":"CHICubs"}

Det handler om definitioner, både af psykiatrisk og somatisk sygdom, men også om definitionen af ordet \"sygdom\".\n\nModargumentet i lægefaglige kredse er følgende:\n\nVed \"sygdom\" forstås en biologisk normalafvigelse eller systemfejl, der subjektivt forringer livskvalitet og/eller medfører tab af leveår.\n\nEn somatisk sygdom forringer kroppens funktionsniveau, mens en psykiatrisk forringer sindets funktionsniveau.

Men det er ikke påvist, at dette er på baggrund af biologien alene eller om det drejer sig om social stigmatisering. Det modsatte er heller ikke påvist, så vidt jeg ved.

He begins by immediately trying to squat 2 plates and fails. He then demands that his girlfriend takes all the weight off the bar, put the bar back in place, and add more weight for his next set. She does it and this cycle continues about 4 times: each time he fails and each time demands for more weight to be put on. \n\nWhen it’s her turn, she asks if she should start with just the bar since she has never squatted before, keeping in mind she’s pretty tiny. He says no, that everyone can do at least a plate and if they can’t do that, then there’s no point in lifting at all. She tries a plate and can’t lift the bar off the rack. She looks to him for support and asks if she’s doing okay and if she should try a lower weight. “No. It’s not worth it,” and he leaves to go over to the benches.  \n\nA similar thing happens with the guy at the bench, where she had to keep adding weights for him. At the start of her turn she was nervous, saying she wasn’t sure she would be able to even do the bar since she has trouble doing pushups. He just said that anything less than her body weight (probably around 110?) is weak and pathetic but since she did terrible at squat he would allow her to start with 55. She didn’t do it and just looked miserable. For her next set, she did just the bar and was able to do a few reps! She looked really happy, then her boyfriend just went, “ehh. it’s not that good. nothing to be happy about” as he proceeds to walk out of the weight room without her. \n\nAs she was going around putting both of their weights away, one of the bigger guys in the gym stopped her and told her that she did a good job for someone who is just starting out.

Sorry for the length in advance.\n\nI posted last week that I messaging a few people, but one of them was a dude who I was exchanging 1k+ word messages with. We were meant to meet on Saturday for coffee, but I moved it to Friday dinner, such was my eagerness.\n\nWe met up outside a tube station, and it was kind of awkward while we both tried to work out how to get to the Japanese place I'd picked. Finally, we got in and luckily there was a table free. I'm a small eater, and was nervous as hell, so couldn't finish my tofu katsu, but gave it to him to finish. He was so nervous about eating it, probably not helped by us joking about him telling his friends he'd been on a first date and eaten the girl's dinner.\n\nThere was barely a pause in conversation and what pause there was, was mostly because we were chewing. AWe decided to just start walking after dinner. We'd met at 6.30pm, by the time we stopped walking it was 12:15am and we were worried about last train.\n\nHe hadn't touched me and had kept his distance so I wasn't sure he was interested, but, because I liked him, I decided to take a chance and invite him to my place for a \"movie\". He agreed, to my surprise, and so we went back to mine.\n\nWe had a couple of glasses of wine each, sat on the patio before it got too cold, and stayed up talking until about 5am when I realised I was a little drunk. We then went to bed, still not having kissed or anything. But, once in bed, things went underway in a big way, and boy for a really sweet, slightly awkward guy, he was...so very, very good. I was on my period, but he didn't give a shit, even went down on me (*swoon*).\n\nNext morning, had sex before we went to shower and ate toast. Had sex one more time, in which he fucked my septum ring out of me. We talked a lot, mostly cuddling and kissing in bed, other than some intense fooling around. He was going to leave, but we ended up falling asleep and didn't wake up until 10:30pm, so we ordered pizza and decided he would stay over again. We watched Archer while eating, and chatting here and there.\n\nHe left this morning after having a coffee, I walked him to the station. I had an amazing time - we talked about so much, having pretty in depth and honest discussions about our relationship and sexual histories, our families and friends, experiences etc. as well as the kind of things we'd thought about doing. We also got into some philosophy on Friday night, which was great.\n\nHe's taking me to Tate Britain on Friday before we go back to his to play a board game (I collect them, he's played quite a few and is interested in playing more, so I have to decide what to take), and the plan is for me to stay over. Hopefully I won't end up as sore as I am today, fucking hell.\n\nThe only problem: I have three other dates in the works, one arranged for tomorrow.

{"body":"Almost every time complex numbers are introduced into physics, it's to model rotation. To that effect, they always come paired with an exponential, in the form e^(ix). This is because this function traces a circle in the complex plane.\n\nSimple rotation isn't always present in physics, but since we understand circular motion very well, we have devised many ways to reduce the motion of a complicated system to just circles.\n\nFor example, in classical mechanics, if you have a complicated potential V(x), you can simplify the motion of small oscillations about a potential minimum by expanding in in a Taylor series about the equilibrium point x_0 and discarding terms of order 3 and higher. Then the resulting force F=-k(x-x_0) generates simple harmonic motion, which is just a kind of circular motion in phase space (the space with coordinates x and p).\n\nSame happens with waves: a plane wave is just simple harmonic motion that propagates in space. In electromagnetism \u0026amp; optics, a wave of light won't usually be so simple, but using Fourier series we can decompose it into a series of sine waves, which again are related to circles and thus can be described by imaginary exponentials.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, as you probably know, the state of a system is modelled by a vector that moves in an (usually) infinite dimensional space. The vector's motion will generally be quite convoluted, but again using Fourier series you can decompose the vector's motion into several vectors rotating at different speeds (energy eigenstates). Then the energy of an eigenstate is literally the speed with which the vector rotates about the origin as you let time pass (up to a factor of hbar). That is:\n\nV(t)=e^(-iEt/hbar) V(0)\n\nThis is for example the origin of the \"i\" in Schrodinger's equation. Even in more advanced subjects like particle physics, many phenomena where complex numbers appear can be traced back to a kind of periodic transformation e^(iA), where A is not a simple number but a more complex object (a Hermitian operator).\n\nOther situation where physicists like to use complex numbers is to make use of the powerful concepts of complex analysis. It's in this situation where concepts like analytic continuation, principal value, Dirac delta function, poles, residues, etc. arise. But those are more sophisticated than circular motion.","score":"95","subreddit":"Physics"}

Are you saying that parking minimums need to be present so that car owners interests will be represented? What about all those people who don't own cars? Cars are already the most subsidized form of transportation on the planet. The developer should be required to build spaces because you don't want to pay the cost of market rate parking at a garage nearby? Your argument seems to be that because lots of people drive now we should keep making it easy for them to drive, which is the exact opposite of a smart growth strategy for an ever-densfiying city. \n\nThe status quo is simply unsustainable.

{"body":"This is just my 2 cents. While it can be fun when it's fresh and new alcohol is most certainly addictive. I would suggest not drinking every night because that will lead you down a dark path. Also I have a personal rule I like to share with people. No alcohol for the 1st 8 hours I'm awake and no caffeine for the 2nd 8. That way I'm not day drinking and being generally useless during business hours and I can still sleep at night. As with anything that can intoxicate you moderation and restraint are key. It's still early enough in your drinking career to not let it grow into full blown alcoholism. And if it gets to the point were you're drinking alone at home you should really start to worry. \n\nThat being said you can still have your fun. Go out drinking with some buddies on the weekends. But when you do it's not necessary to binge to catch up for not drinking all week. It should be used as a social lubricant and not as a crutch. Plus no one likes a blacked out drunk.\n\nJust be safe and responsible and make sure to have fun. If you find yourself doing it too much or drinking away feelings you might want to take a hiatus. \n\nAlso, and this really should go without saying but I'm gonna say it anyway, never drive if you've had more than 1 and haven't sat and let it work itself out.

{"body":"This is some basic ass drama over Sanders endorsing The California Drug Price Relief Act which is a referendum that will go onto the ballot in November. This law would \"restrict the amount that any state agency could pay for drugs, tying it to the price paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, an organization that falls under certain state laws regarding drug price negotiations\" ([source](https://ballotpedia.org/California_%22Drug_Price_Relief_Act%22_Initiative_\\(2016\\))).\n\nApparently, some AIDS/HIV activists have come out in favor of it while others have come out against it. The only arguments I could find against it after a very surface level online search is that the Big Pharma companies say it will stop innovation, increase prices, and offend to market gods (standard supply side economics stuff). The referendum is also supported by the Nurse's Union. \n\n**So here is the drama:**\n\nAfter meeting with Sanders on a forum about AIDS/HIV, the activists against the referendum tweeted \"The #AIDS activist mtng w/ @BernieSanders was productive, but his campaign's press release used \u0026amp; abused\" ([source](https://twitter.com/peterstaley/status/735889198994051072)) because Sanders didn't take their side. This is an obvious grab for attention.\n\nSome Sanders aide then subtweeted that the activists against the referendum are in bed with Big Pharma based on this [press release by the proponents of the referendum](http://www.stoppharmagreed.com/motivesopponents/). According to that press release with some thorough evidence, the activists against the referendum receive funding from Big Pharma. \n\nDan Savage (who is friends with the activists against the referendum) then swoops in and call Sanders homophobic, etc. Also now they're saying Sanders is anti-PrEP because one of the groups supporting the referendum is anti-PrEP. \n\nMind you that Sanders has endorsed PrEP in his platform \"Bernie will support proven, evidence-based policies to combat HIV and AIDS including treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)\" ([source](https://berniesanders.com/issues/hiv-and-aids/)).\n\nFurthermore from reading this blog post and the open letter against Sander's, I still have not seen one argument why The California Drug Price Relief Act is bad other than it's sponsored by a group that is anti-PrEP. It smells to me (just based on living in California and watching referendum drama year after year) that the group against it is just angry their name isn't on it. \n\nIt just seems like this all some petty \"in-scene\" drama between activists who are trying to hijack Sander's name for 15 minutes of fame. The activists are just as guilty (if not more so) of using AIDS/HIV/PrEP to try to get attention and score political points. Also, kind of tin foil hat, but most of the people basing on Bernie for this are strong Hillary supporters.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlso the guy leading the big stink is an investment banker and his brother was the CEO of JP Morgan and now is the CEO of Barclays Bank. Somehow not surprised that they're against Bernie and a law that would keep drug costs down, as they actively work in an industry that rapes the working and middle classes (especially marginalized groups like queer people and people of color) for the profit of the few.

This makes them extremely mobile, which is a bad thing.\n\n4) You pointed out that a defender would have time to respond to an ankylo attacking a structure, you are right, but what about when nobody is online? Offline raiding is one of the largest complaints about the current game (though admittedly complaints on this subreddit have died off pretty significantly lately).\n\n5) The ankylo is already one of the most important utility dinos on Ark right now, it is VITAL for Pvp tribes who want to be competitive. Why should the devs buff an already commonly utilized tame?\n\nDon't get me wrong, it makes sense that Ankylos could destroy metal from a standpoint of immersion sense (this is not my favorite term in the world but it will work for now). But pvp balance should come before immersion sense.","score":"18","subreddit":"playark"}

Using 20x sounds like it is extreme when in reality it isn't.

{"body":"I can only talk about what I know and I am sure someone has a better definition, and also I will just use examples to try to explain the concepts. \n\nObjectification is only seeing someone as a sexual object or something that is here for your own pleasure. For instance, having someone you have absolutely no interest in until you're horny. They're not a person, you don't care about how they're doing, their wishes and desires, you just want to have sex, and they're there for that only.\n\nSexualization is taking something that is not inherently sexual, and viewing it as such. For instance, in the Western World, we have sexualized female breasts to the point where it is always censored. Not all of the Western World does this, for instance breasts are rarely censored in France, and it was apparently the same in Germany until very recently. \n\nTwo more examples of sexualization that are wrong. One is the sexualization of children. In our society, we do this all the time. For instance, we censor girls' nipples, but not those of boys. We put this sexual purpose on a young prepubescent girl's body even though besides her private parts, she has the exact same body as a boy her age. The second one is specific to young Black girls, who are often sexualized years before other people. An example I have and that you can look for yourself is Skai Jackson. She is a 14 year old girl who got very famous from a meme, but she has always been pretty known in her circle as a catalog model (she has been active since her toddler years). If you go though her social media, you will often see comments from grown people talking about her body as if it were that of a grown woman. Many people comment about her breasts and her butt. She is 14! \n\nThird example that does not concern children: dancing. Many dances are sexualized even though they are more than sexual dances. For instance, belly dancing. Belly dancing can be a sensual dance, but it is more than that. It is not a dance that is solely meant to please the eyes of men in a sexual way. It has technique and history. Yet, nowadays, it is viewed as so. So much so that when I was younger, I remember many parents getting angry because our teacher decided to make us dance baladi for our Grade 6 graduation. They thought it would be wrong for young children (young girls) to dance such a style. \n\nSo yes, sexualization can be wrong. So can objectification, but both can be 'okay', but I don't know if I would go as far as saying they can be good. For instance, hooking up with someone you don't know or care about is a form of objectification, certain dances can be sexualized. Both scenarios are okay. ","score":"17","subreddit":"AskWomen"}

{"body":"Eh. I don't think you understand true racism versus Aussie asshattery. Making fun of Indians or chinesees, or saying the refugees or Sudanese are dangerous is nothing compared to true racism. True racism is systemic policies that keep minorities down for centuries. Australia is a white country, and all the systems are setup as if everyone is white- so they're much fairer than anything in the US or uk. \n\nFor instance, the overwhelming majority of house and apartments are sold by auctions. The only thing that matters is who has the most money. There is zero racial discrimination in the Australian property market for buyers. \n\nZero. \n\nCompare that to America where blacks still can't buy houses in nice suburbs and when they do, the nooses start. Lol. To me, being called a black cunt by some bogan is nothing compared to be systemically excluded from good housing stock and good schools. But I guess to some, maybe name calling is worse.\n\nI'm not going to say Aussies aren't racist. Lots are. But Australia isn't racist. Australia still builds trains because they're for everyone, it doesn't treat mass transit as welfare for people who can't afford cars. Compare that to the us or uk where minorities live vast sprawling ghettos with no way out. \n\nGeez, look at a newspaper. America schools are more segregated now than they were in the 60s. With the exception of some aboriginal towns up north, you cannot find that kind of segregation in Australia. That's true racism. America is racist. Americans might be less racist but when you've got defacto education and housing segregation, millions of blacks in prison...that's real racism.

If his death however is a trigger to bring him back to the right path he died in a more heroic/emotional act that was NOT in vain.\n\n\"Redemption is lame/overdone/a cliché\"\nBecause of Vader? I see people saying \"I want him to go darker and die as a full blown villain\". How many villains do you know that go from evil to more evil? How many \"Vaders\" do you know? (Changing their minds in the last second, then dying for it) Now... how many bad guys switching sides but remaining somewhat dark do you know? In movies, not TV series? Yeha, pretty much none. If there are any - they are rare (in comparison to you standard villain and the sacrifice-villain)\n\nI don't get why people want Kylo Ren to go full dark and die. I have what seems to be a very unpopular opinion: I want him to realize the first order is a disaster (Hosnian system destruction: he didn't agree with it. Murdering his father - it weakened him.) and then change the sides. I do NOT want a Light-side Ben Solo. It'd seem too drastic. I'd like to see a Kylo Ren / Dark Ben Solo staying with the dark side but \"fighting for the right thing\". \nWe never saw a good dark sider. Kylo Ren / Ben Solo has the potential to become something entirely new.\n\nBonus: It might be a far reach but I think he captures the theme of depression/loneliness/being abandoned and mental abuse/manipulation on a child\u0026amp;teenager really well.\nI do not want a character that was driven where he is by loneliness/depression dying lonely too. It is bitter, it is dark, it might make a great story. But -to me- that speaks against the spirit of Star Wars. Put that stuff in Game of Thrones and I'll love it there but I won't take any celebration-scene nicely if they just killed off a guy that deserved redemption more than Vader ever did a few minutes ago in the most bitter way.

{"body":"It's only valid in saying that society in general is too invested in focusing on female appearance, and there is much more pressure to be conventionally attractive for a female than a male. Life is easier when you're conventionally attractive for everyone, but especially females. There's a definite hyper-focus on female looks (think how massive beauty, fashion, and weightloss industries have become) but I don't know if the answer is to give equal focus to men (which seems to be slowly happening) or to somehow convince a world to be less obsessed with looks even as we become moreso every day. I think people who choose to not conform to conventional beauty standards obviously have that right, but I wouldn't suggest it because it makes life more difficult than it needs to be, and when you think about it it doesn't really change anything as far as standards- meaning you may choose to be fat and look ugly, but the world isn't suddenly going to see you as anything but fat and ugly, and you're going to get a lot of extra negative shit for that.  Plus obesity isn't some feminist rebellion like idiots like to pretend, it's sloth and ruining your body, and then excusing it in a way which sounds good. There's absolutely no way on this earth that feminism says be self destructive to piss men off. \n\nWhile people accept obese partners because they have to, because they don't have the ability to pull someone who isn't maybe, it doesn't mean they aren't fully aware they're settling, and it's super doubtful that all things equal they wouldn't choose to have a partner that resembles a supermodel vs someone like Ragen. So just because some fat \"feminist\" found someone desperate enough to partner them, that doesn't mean they found someone who sees beyond looks.  I don't think it's wrong at all to say you should lose weight because you will be hotter and life will be better. It's true. Health is important too of course, but even saying life expectancy and quality of life were equal, life is still far better overall when you're good looking. ","score":"14","subreddit":"fatlogic"}

{"body":"Definitely agree with Checkers, and I'd add a few points;\n\nThe blade at the bottom would be my ideal place for a blade if I was defending against it. Your range is limited to basically elbowing range, meaning you can only throw hooking strikes. So after one slash and some distance, I know how the next one's coming, and I'm going to take it from you. Also your finger is hooked in there, so I'm going to break that (off) when I take it.\n\nAdding to that point, there are very serious implications to adding a knife to the situation. I'd know you mean to take my life now, and what could have been a disengage just defaulted to a struggle over a weapon. We'll probably end up on the ground, and then it becomes strength-on-strength, which is a coin-flip regarding who dies today.\n\nAlso, the legal ramifications of adding 'with a deadly weapon' to whatever assault takes place might not be in your favor. We all like to imagine a perfectly fair and reasonable legal outcome when the cops show up, but it's equally likely you get slapped with a brandishing charge when the attacker's buddy flags down a patrol.\n\nFrankly, a blade is the last thing I'd ever want to throw into a fight, on either end. No one wins a knife fight. Try sparring once with a sharpie, and see how many arteries wind up with ink on them.","score":"16","subreddit":"kravmaga"}

{"body":"Canadian here.\n\nAs much as Bernie's stance is the closest to what we have in Canada (higher taxes, free healthcare, more socialist-leaning) I seriously hope Trump wins. Here's why:\n\nThe single greatest determinant of health is income. Above education, above access to healthcare, etc. it is income.\n\nThe candidate that has the best policies for growing the middle class in America is Trump. His plan to keep businesses in America with punitive taxes is already working (see Carrier, the air conditioning company, and Ford) and will keep jobs in America. His lower taxes (especially no tax on those making less than 25,000) will give help to the people that need it the most. His plan to keep out illegal immigration (which costs the US $18 billion in healthcare spending each year) will not only raise wages (no illegals competing for lower wages) and improve education (less crowded classrooms) but it will also make America safer (illegal immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than legal immigrants and citizens). As much as I, as a Canadian, may not agree with Trump's stance on abortion, it is really a much smaller issue compared to the bigger picture of the welfare of the whole country. Under Trump, the economy will grow (the US hasn't hit 3% GDP growth in any year throughout Obama's presidency) and everyone will be better off. He doesn't have a problem with women (he has more female executives at higher levels of his companies than males) and he doesn't hate blacks (he fought to allow blacks and Jews into his country club back when Hillary belonged to an all-white club), nor does he hate legal immigrants (he married one). He sees through the thin veil of the trans-pacific partnership which would raise drug prices and take away innumerable civil rights.\n\nOn the other hand, Bernie wants to turn the US into a democratic socialist country (that didn't turn out well for Venezuela - a country with insane oil resources but just last week declared a state of economic emergency) or any other country that has tried socialism in the past (who wants to wait hours in line for bread or milk?). He also claims to want to take money out of politics but has spent roughly the same amount as Hillary in this election (at least $180 million; whereas Trump has spent less than $60 million). He has paid with campaign contributions for a private plane to take him to the Vatican where he gave a ten minute speech that the pope was not even present for. Under Bernie, the $15 minimum wage will cause rampant unemployment (Wendy's is replacing workers with machines due to high cost of labour) and small businesses will close. The average American will be much worse off both for their wallet and their health.\n\nHillary has not done anything in office that can be widely recognized as a positive change on her part, and she has flip-flopped her opinions at the drop of a hat (first she opposed gay marriage, then she was for it; she championed NAFTA as the best economic decision, then she stated it was a mistake; she most recently stated that she would put coal workers out of a job but when confronted stated that she would not) and when she is confronted about her lies she dodges the question. She is corrupt in the worst way, hides her husband's frankly insane history of sexual assaults, and has been described by her closest aides as \"frequently confused\" (see the emails) and by bill as a coke addict. She has an unstoppable ambition to become the first woman President of the United States (and plays for the woman card frequently) but will turn the country over to the banks (the few people who were willing to talk to reporters about the content of her Wall Street speeches - for which she continually refuses to release the transcripts without good reason - describe the speeches as if she was gushing about Wall Street and singing their praises).\n\nWhy, as a Canadian doctor, do I care so much?\n\nAs the US is our greatest ally and only neighbour, what happens in your country greatly influences what happens in mine. For the sake of the wellbeing of the more than 300 million Americans and more than 30 million Canadians, I hope that you all see through the media lies, confront your own biases, and do your research.\n\nPlease forgive any mistakes and the terrible lack of links and citations, I'm on mobile.","score":"17","subreddit":"medicine"}

I remember when I was doing my PhD in evolutionary mycology he agreed to help provide specimens for a major Psilocybe phylogenetics study then being carried out by an international group of real university researchers (Psilocybes being his thing, as an old hippie), with which I was tangentially involved. My general impression was that his morphotaxonomy skills were OK, but he refrained from any real contribution to the scientific discussion because he was out of his depth when it came to the actual genetics, stats, formal ecological models, etc. \n\nI don't know about his more recent work beyond what's in the TED talks.

Like Attack lowering Growl or Leer to reduce it's Defense enough to nullify Milk Drink.\n\nUnfortunately, like the first two Gyms in Pokemon Red, the game does a poor job foreshadowing that. (Lt. Surge is better since you have more Pokemon with more moves and Diglett Cave is nearby with a straight immunity to Raichu's strongest move)\n\nOn topic: The Big Octorok boss in Minish Cap sucked.  The first phase is straight forward enough, reflect projectile back, Octorok stuff.  It's second phase is unfortunate.  It freezes the ground so you have to run (slip) behind him and set his grassy ass on fire with your short range lantern. He had this annoying tendency to turn around and eat you before you landed the attack.\n\nThe whole thing could have been improved if you got a better weapon than a Lantern in that temple. Lanterns are always the crappy item you get in the beginning of Zelda games, if it was a Fire Rod it would have allowed for more puzzles *and* would have made that boss suck less.\n\n\nKyogre in Pokemon Pinball R/S sucks too.  To disrupt the player is stokes these whirlpools that take control of the ball from the player for like ten seconds. You have three minutes to kill it and you spend a minute and a half waiting to gain control of your ball again.

Basically anything above $0 that the DNC or other candidates get, is better than where they would be without her.\n\nThird; The HVF is not independent and unbiased. It is a pro-Hillary organization that was setup to ensure that donations within its fundraisers above $2700 don't go to Clinton's campaign as per FEC rules. That anything over $2700 instead goes to the DNC, to state parties, or to the fund itself. Accusing it of only helping Clinton is accusing it of doing it's job.\n\nThe problems that should be under discussion, is 1) if the DNC is unfairly supporting Clinton. This has nothing to do with Clinton joint fundraising for the DNC. A party member supporting the party is not a bad thing. This is a debate had many times on these forums. And 2) if the HVF is using funds marked as outside the campaign fund in collaboration with the campaign itself. Not that the HVF is pro-Clinton...but that they are coordinating with Clinton where they shouldn't be. There is no clear evidence that this is the case.

I believe an important point about people who develop more and more accepting views of others is that we should realize that they first started with an intolerant point of view. \n\nI grew up in a religious white suburb, and we were all homophobic. I've since come around fully, and I get disgusted to see people still being homophobic. But I must remember that if I would like to see people change their minds, I shouldn't alienate them for hold a regressive view that I once held myself. You're right. It would just deter them from considering the new view. \n\nI don't dislike Hillary for supporting DOMA in the 90's. I do like Bernie for supporting homosexual rights in the 70's. And I like him for having incredible foresight on NAFTA and many other issues. \n\nIt would be nice if we were all more graceful and compassionate towards each other as we develop more progressive views about human rights and equality. In the mean time, I want to elect a leader who will actually lead by suggesting and promoting progressive views while we are all busy catching up.","score":"57","subreddit":"politics"}

Bush administration for access to minutes of Vice President Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force.[10] After several years of legal wrangling, in May, 2005 an appeals court permitted the Energy Task Force's records to remain secret.[11][12] Judicial Watch called the decision \"a defeat for open government\" and Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch said the ruling fit the trend of increasing secrecy in the Bush administration.[13] Judicial Watch was involved in a similar legal dispute with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2002 when the group filed a shareholder lawsuit against Halliburton. The lawsuit, which accused Halliburton of accounting fraud, alleged that \"when Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, he and other directors inflated revenue reports, boosting Halliburton's share price.\" [14] As reported by the Wall Street Journal the court filing claims the oil-field-services concern overstated revenue by a total of $445 million from 1999 through the end of 2001.[15]\n\n\u0026gt; In 2006 Judicial Watch sued the Secret Service to force the release of logs detailing convicted former lobbyist Jack Abramoff's visits to the White House.
