Ich hatte also nun meine Zunge in der Hand, Herzrasen, bin beinahe verrückt geworden. Was zum Teufel macht man in so einer Situation? Sie ist mir ein paar mal durch die Finger geflutscht und ich hatte Angst, sie komplett zu verlieren und nie wieder eine Zunge zu haben! Wirklich reine Panik, also habe ich das einzig vernünftige getan und sie wieder rein geschoben - irgendwie und dann geschluckt und schon war alles beim alten. Bin nach einiger Beruhigungszeit wieder eingeschlafen und hab seither keiner Seele davon erzählt. \n\nIch weiß bis heute nicht, ob meine Zunge wirklich aus meinem Mund draußen war, eigentlich ist das ja unmöglich. Was ich dann in der Hand hatte und in meinen Rachen geschoben habe, kann ich mir aber auch nicht erklären.

{"body":"Also ich muss das jetzt loswerden, weil mir inzwischen wirklich der Kragen platzt:\n\nDieses reflexartige, unreflektierte, unüberlegte, und bisweilen schlicht dumme Losranten gegen Politiker, insbesondere gegen SPD-Politiker geht mir brutal auf den Sack! Es verdirbt mir den Spaß, den ich sonst beim Lesen von /r/de habe. Ist es denn zu viel verlangt, mal eine Sekunde nachzudenken, in welchem Zusammenhang so ein Satz stehen könnte? Ich sehe hier User, die in anderen Fäden (zu Recht) die Pegida-Futzis verachten und belächeln, weil sie unreflektiert Parolen nachgrölen und trotzdem reicht es offenbar bei einigen, 'Politiker' oder 'SPD' zu lesen um den *grumlgrumlVolksveräter*-Reflex auszulösen. Wer sich angesprochen fühlt, soll sich schämen. Hier seid nicht besser, als die Pegidas.\n\nJetzt mal zur Sache und mit Kontext: Das Zitat stammt aus einem Interview mit der Welt. Und zwar\n\n\u0026gt;Die Welt: In Deutschland beansprucht jeder Bürger im Schnitt eine Wohnfläche von 45 Quadratmetern, das ist fast doppelt so viel wie in den 50er-Jahren. Wie wollen Sie diese Entwicklung stoppen?\n\n\u0026gt;Hendricks: Der Trend bei jungen Leuten, die als Singles in den Großstädten leben, geht doch dahin, dass sie gar nicht so viel Platz benötigen. Darauf stellen sich beim Neubau auch schon viele Architekten ein. Junge Berufstätige brauchen doch meist nicht mehr als 30 bis 35 Quadratmeter Wohnfläche, weil sie ja hauptsächlich zum Schlafen in ihren Wohnungen sind.\n\nWie man sieht, hat die Antwort nur feststellenden Charakter darüber, wie viele junge Menschen in Großstädten leben. Es ist nicht normativ formuliert, d.h. sie sagt nicht, dass man so leben soll oder muss. Es wird schon gar nicht eine Art 'soziales Minimum' definiert. Die Aussage so aus dem Zusammenhang zu reißen halte ich im Übrigen für ein journalistisches Armutszeugnis.\n\nInteressanter finde ich es übrigens, die Frage und Antwort mal zwischen den Zeilen zu lesen und auch darauf zu achten, was Hendricks *nicht* sagt. Die Frage selbst ist ja schon eine Suggestivfrage. Die Welt hofft offensichtlich darauf, erklärt zu bekommen, wie man 'diese Entwicklung' stoppen könne. Beim Beantworten würde man aber implizit der Aussage 'die Entwicklung, dass die durchschnittliche Wohnungsgröße und damit der Lebensstandard gestiegen ist, ist schlecht' zustimmen. Beruhigenderweise beantwortet Hendricks die Frage eben nicht, tappt also nicht in die Falle, sondern weicht aus, indem sie den ist-Zustand beschreibt.\n\nEdit: Hier übrigens noch der Link zum ganzen Interview: http://www.welt.de/finanzen/immobilien/article156052982/Junge-Leute-brauchen-nicht-mehr-als-30-Quadratmeter.html.","score":"63","subreddit":"de"}

{"body":"Vor etlichen Monaten hat so ca. 1,5km von meiner Wohnung entfernt die gleiche Straße hoch ein mittelgroßes Flüchtlingsheim aufgemacht, was ich eigentlich nur dadurch bemerkt habe, daß ein paar mehr \"fremdländisch\" aussehende Menschen durch diese Straße gelaufen sind; ist halt der Weg in die Innenstadt. Probleme: keine.\n\nAußerdem hat der Lidl um die Ecke irgendwann einen Wachmann bekommen. Als ich so einen zum ersten Mal sah habe ich ihn gefragt, ob es denn neuerdings Probleme im Laden gäbe. Der verneinte und meinte, das wäre eine Vorsichtsmaßnahme. Es kommt mir auch so vor, als wäre nicht immer ein Wachmann anwesend. Probleme konnte ich aber nicht beobachten; ist der gleiche Lidl wie zuvor.\n\nAber zu der guten Geschichte:\n\nVor ein paar Monaten stellte ich fest, daß mein Perso abgelaufen war. Da ich wegen einem Projektauftrag unter der Woche nicht in meiner Heimatstadt war/bin hatte ich mir einen Freitag frei genommen, um einen neuen Perso zu beantragen. Mir wurde dann peinlich das Grundlagenwissen \"Behördengänge in Deutschland\" in Erinnerung gerufen: städtische Beamte arbeiten am Freitag nur vormittags und es war dann doch schon 13 Uhr. Ganz böser Fauxpas meinerseits! Immerhin ist die Infotheke der städtischen Einrichtung etwas fortschrittlicher, denn sie hat freitags etwas länger auf, um diverse Tickets zu verkaufen (Bus, Theater, Museum, hassenichjesehen). Die nette Dame dort meinte, ich solle doch in einen Vorort fahren, dort gäbe es eine Nebenstelle, die freitags bis 16 Uhr geöffnet hat und auch Anträge neuer Personalausweise bearbeitet.\n\nIch setze mich also in einen Bus dahin, bewaffnet mit einem Infofaltblatt über die Nebenstelle, welches ihre glorreichen Leistungen anpreist und einen von diesen sehr nebulösen \"Kartenausschnitten\" aufweist: Ungefähre Grenzen des Vororts in Linien skizziert, die drei Hauptstrassen schematisch eingezeichnet und mitten in einem hellroten Nichts ein schwarzer Punkt - DA muß ich hin. Aha. Um zu meiner weiteren Frustration beizutragen präsentierte mein not-so-Smartphone einen schwarzen Bildschirm - Akku leer, also nix Navi, die Adresse der Nebenstelle hatte ich ja. Hrmpf!\n\nMeine Rettung: Zwei \"fremdländische\" Herren Ende 20, Anfang 30, welche an der nächsten Bushaltestelle einstiegen. Ich hatte auf deutsch gefragt, ob sie mir sagen könnten, an welcher Haltestelle ich raus muß und wie ich zu dieser Behörde komme. Antworten waren zuerst gebrochenes Deutsch, dann switch to english. Stellte sich raus: Beides syrische Flüchtlinge. Einer von den beiden meinte, er wisse, wo diese Nebenstelle ist und er könne es mir zeigen. Der ist dann tatsächlich mit mir dahin gelatscht, um mir den Weg zu zeigen! Auf dem Weg erzählte er, er hatte in Syrien \"political economy\" studiert (Volkswirtschaft? - klang so), jetzt müsse er erstmal viel Deutsch lernen, damit er vielleicht irgendwann hier einen anerkannten Abschluß machen kann, weil sein Abschluß hier nichts gilt. Er hat es sich nicht explizit anmerken lassen, aber eine gewisse Frustration, \"alles nochmal machen zu müssen\" war erkennbar. Kann ich nachvollziehen, aber so ist es halt.\n\ntl;dr: Sehr netter syrischer Flüchtling rettet den Tag eines \"Biodeutschen\", damit der einen neuen Perso beantragen kann.

Und wenn wir den Finger anklagend auf Gesellschaften richten, in denen Homophobie noch mit ausgesprochen brutaler Gewalt gelebt wird, dann ist das noch lange nicht heuchlerisch, bloß weil wir selber die Homophobie noch nicht zu 100% ausgemerzt haben.\n\n\u0026gt;Genauso geschmacklos ist es allerdings, dass sich als Verbündeter hingestellt, wenn gleichzeitig die Realität ignoriert wird.

In Maryland, we have a number of national parks and landmarks including Fort McHenry and the Chesapeake Bay.  But believe it or not, there are groups that fight against protecting the Bay.  I'm guessing it's similar on other states and follows the logic I outlined with the GOP's \"A Better Way\" proposal.  \n\nGroups who don't want to see money go towards NPS, at least in Maryland, are those who want alternative use of that land or regions.  Bay detractors include those who like to dump waste in the water, such as agriculture runoff, suburban sewage runoff, wastewater/factory runoff, etc.  Similar to why a carbon tax or cap-n-trade program faces difficulty, it's about the money.  If it costs businesses more, they will fight against it, even if we're talking about such a relatively small amount in the grand scheme of things.  \n\nBecause it varies by state (Maryland is big on support thanks to our overall love of the Bay), you will have difficulty getting the billions needed without a big push from the more environmentally-unfriendly members of Congress.  The closest that I've found in the little searching I have is [this bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3556/text) from Rep Grijalva from Arizona... and if you look at the dollar amounts, they're in the millions of dollars range for a fiscal year, not anywhere near where it should be.  \n\nSo in short, groups not wanting land to be used how it's used + budget anal-ness + lack of sexiness to trees/rock = tough sell IMO.

I liked how the backstory vingettes lent an older cast to the story, and [K season one spoilers](/s \"added deep tragedy\"). Whilst these scenes were short, I found them very affecting. They build into the poignant conclusion of K's first season. They clearly had a distinct tone from other parts of the  interwoven narrative beyond the colorful filters. Contrast, for example, these with the Yata/Fushimi scenes which were fast action and splashy magical effects.  \n\nWith their various other spin off and side project, the multimedia K-project wants to have something to offer for everyone.\n\nedit: for a meta spoiler\n\n\u0026gt;end of S1 you see all sorts of german being used\n\nYep, they cast a Japanese-German seiyuu, for a German character. He's introduced in a scene where a bunch of Germans are speaking German language, and he never has any lines in German. \\*sigh* ","score":"1","subreddit":"anime"}

Love Live involves a group of girls fucking around and singing and dancing, while Idolmaster focuses singularly on the girls as humans, and their ambitions to be stars.

On the other hand, the episode also sold how idols do treasure the compliments their fans give them.\") It reminded of the recent TSM Legends documentary episode in which Biofrost, a new member of TSM, was at a fan event and surprised and thankful for the amount of attention he was getting.

Considering that this show is up there with the later parts of Zeta as the darkest UC Gundam has gotten in this rewatch so far, whatever she injected is likely harmful.\n\nOf course the Federation is using Child Soldiers. I mean, the entire White Base was crewed by children. Fuck the Federation. Even Io is disturbed.\n\nYep, the injection was seemingly a suicide attempt. Fuck. Pressure of sending people to die is getting to her.\n\nDeryl definitely isn't entirely comfortable with having no limbs. He'll bear it for the sake of defeating Io, and he'll feign comfort, but he's not happy about it.\n\nI just noticed that Cornelius looks like Kamille, a little. His observations are astute. I've got a feeling that Io will probably end up in the Titans.\n\nAnd now Io's told the mission to the child pilots. I doubt they'll come back alive.\n\nWe get some backstory for Karla! Apparently, her father is a political prisoner who will face the death penalty if it weren't for Karla's work. Deryl doesn't blame her at all for the amputation, it seems. He's a genuinely good person in a series full of arseholes. And he's now launched.\n\nThe child soldiers are already being torn to shreds. T_T They managed to take out the Zaku that was doing it, but that one Zaku took out a lot of untrained child soldiers.\n\nAnd then they got another mobile suit against them, this one much more powerful. The child soldiers are utterly doomed.\n\nThe Zeon ship is going down, it seems, given the evacuation order has been given. Karla is staying aboard.\n\nKarla is really, really, pissed off at the Gundam, and justifiably so. But she is also laughably unmatched, and probably isn't doing any damage. Deryl, on the other hand, is wiping out entire Feddie ships. Good lord, the animation is spectacular.\n\nIo took out the bridge of the Zeon ship Karla was on, then shot escape pods containing injured Zeon escapees. He's a colossal douche.\n\nWait, what just happened? Was Graham a spy? That came out of nowhere... Anyway, Claudia is dead, and the Federation ship has gone down.\n\nWe end the episode with Io charging at Deryl, and a duel beginning.","score":"2","subreddit":"anime"}

That said ive also lost 2 close friends growing up and it sucks, but you just need to remind yourself its anime and such.  \n\nI havent really been bothered by much in terms of anime, though for me i seem to feel a bit more unpleasent in regards to musicians in anime.  Your Lie in April made me pretty gloomy feeling.  I used to be a musician when i was little and really loved paino, but due to a pumpkin carving accident when i was 13, i accidently cut my left wrist and ruined my left hand which stopped me from getting serious with paino.  But i would still play with my right hand some for fun but i can only do so much with the 1 hand.  But 4 years ago i severed a nerve in my right arm which messed up my only good arm and stopped my art career (ive been more or less unemployed since then and just pass time watching anime and managing stuff).  Well i had been watching Your Lie in April and feeling gloomy because of the music struggles in the story, but had fallen in love with the main little paino meledy that plays in the background a lot, and for some reason decided to bust out a piano and try to play it, which kind of worked a bit, but after a bit my hands stopped working well and i remembered i cant do that anymore and it just kinda bummed me out.  But at the end of the day i understand that life happens and there isnt much you can do about it other than move on.  And thats how i feel about most unpleasentness in life.

It was more an experiment to see if I could enjoy watching animes on my phone (I do not, in particular), than an actual desire to watch the show. Not that it was terrible, but I don't think I can remember a single scene that landed with me. \n\nAlso started and finished **Oshiete!! Galko-chan**, and was so pleasantly surprised by it. I am an adult man, with nothing in common with these characters, but the humour was on point, never mean-spirited, and it was just really refreshing. Rated highly and recommended. \n\nStarted watching **Kyousou Giga**, and loooooved it; I distinctly remember thinking that I hadn't been as well-hooked by an opening episode in quite a while. The style (particularly the colours) and ambience gave me a Katanagatari feel going into it- and then it went a bit nuts in the last few minutes. \nMy only issue is, watching it, I feel like there's more going on that I'm not picking up on, so I'm kind of leery of starting up an episode unless I'm in a particular frame of mind.

{"body":"First off, that fight scene. Loved it. As with the past seasons, it's just so fun that any logical shortcomings can easily be brushed past. Hibiki's giant fist that just kept on upgrading gave me flashbacks of Gurren Lagann, and the final attack as everyone sent beams of energy from their gears was amazing. Hibiki's 'I must save everyone' mentality is still getting on my nerves a bit though. Saving innocent people, sure, great, but saving the person who is trying to DESTROY THE WORLD? Argh. It's frustrating. Anyway, I was surprised that they actually went through with the ~~nuke~~ explosion that destroyed a good chunk of the city. It's nice to see that these massive fights do have consequences, even if they are mostly superficial.\n\nThen the second half of the episode was just... really generic for the most part, the exception being Elfnein dying, but her consciousness transferring into Carol - I think I've got that right. Beyond that, the status quo has been restored, everyone's fine and there seems to be some setup for the next season (though it could easily just be a 'stuff continues to happen!' season end). Then post-credits, there's a scene where Hibiki effectively forces her parents to try again, which to be honest, I was really uncomfortable with. I can understand Hibiki wanting her parents to be happy together again - hell, I've been in the same situation - but people can and do grow apart, and forcing them back together is not a good idea. Hibiki's mom certainly didn't look happy in that last scene. Realistically, I can't see their relationship going well, but I'm sure it'll all be fine because anime.\n\nAnyway, to lighten the tone, final best girl ranking (worst\u0026lt;best):\n\nHibiki\u0026lt;Maria\u0026lt;Shirabe\u0026lt;Chris\u0026lt;Kirika\u0026lt;Tsubasa\n\nOverall, while I did enjoy parts of this season - mostly near the start, though there were great moments throughout - I'd say it was the weakest of the three. Hopefully I'll be able to give some final thoughts on the final thread tomorrow, but if I'm not around, thanks for the rewatch and for the entertainment over the last month or so. I'll certainly be watching season 4 when that rolls around.","score":"5","subreddit":"anime"}

{"body":"Alright here we go. The series is filled with fights, but boy do I love me some classroom antics! Its a good way to understand the characters and have some fun light heart moments before we get hit with some of the darker themes.\n\nStory wise we had a few things happen. Iida is now class president, the gate was destroyed somehow by a strange quirk, and the villains invade the USJ!!!!\n\nVA this was phenomenal Iida episode. I like how serious the VA is all the time as Iida. It'll be perfect for all his comedy and serious moments in the future. We also learned Iida is from a well known and wealthy super hero family. (In later seasons don't be surprise to see a lot of are students family members ;)\n\nKaminari and Kirishima had the most screen time of are support characters. This episode did a real good job of showing them off as character. Kaminari is the laid-back cool guy and Kirishima as the manly friendly classmate. By showing them both try to help out in the stampede, supporting Iida as class president, and their bus banter you can tell they are all around good guys and I think more importantly guys who aren't afraid to say what they think, or speak up. While Bakugou freaks out and Iida is way to uptight sometimes, these two going forward a lot of the time become the voice of the classroom. (Though they both are more fighters then thinkers.)\n\nMina, the pink girl, is the female counterpart to these two. She is very noisy and quick to talk, but is very supportive or her classmates. She didn't get to much screen time this episode, but like all the students we have seasons (season 2 hype) to develop and flesh out these characters.\n\nFinally the hype begins. They went to USJ to train and instead get met with a whole arena filled with villains! No All Might means everyone is going to have to put in some work! This if the first of **many** stand-out villains. (I swear the authors villains are just as good if not better then the heroes.) So we have Facepalm the leader, a fan favorite for his design and character development. BlackMist aka the warp-gate probably the best idea of quirk to give the villains so they can arrive anywhere they want at a moments notice. Then the big freak looking thing which is a brawn character over a thinking character.\n\nOne final thing I love how Deku and Bakugou roles have reversed. Before UA Deku was bullied, but now Bakugou has taken on that role for his over the top personality. These are the top students in the country so it takes a little more to intimidate then \"I'll murder all of you!\". Looking forward to next week!","score":"3","subreddit":"anime"}

All music is set to a pattern or rhythm of beats. The two most common patterns are referred to as 4/4 and 3/4 time. In 4/4 time, the pattern of beats is a repeating count to four: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4... In 3/4 time, the pattern is a repeating count to three: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3... These rhythms both have a naturally occurring emphasis on the first beat which is often referred to as the downbeat. 4/4 time also has a secondary emphasis on the third beat. This emphasis can be demonstrated by simply repeating the sequence verbally while stressing the emphasized beat.\n\nAnd now, the writer will attempt to call the 3/4 beat \"unnatural emphasis\":\n\n\u0026gt; The second evidence has also been mentioned previously, but let us further take notice that rock music has been the music of choice for many satanic cults. For instance, the demonic Process Church had very close ties to both the Rolling Stones and the Beatles,(12) and the Beatles’ press officer said of that band that “They’re completely anti-Christ. I mean, I am anti-Christ as well, but they’re so anti-Christ they shock me which isn’t an easy thing.”(13) Anton LaVey and the Church of Satan also had very close ties to several rock groups including Black Sabbath, The Who, and Ozzy Osbourne.(14) **Clearly, the presence of an unnatural emphasis on the backbeat does not in any way hinder the work of Satan and his demons.**\n\nThen, later in the article:\n\n\u0026gt; **As was mentioned at the beginning of this article, the unnatural and indeed satanic rhythms of rock music are pervasive throughout many different genres.** It would indeed be naive of a Christian to assume that a song is acceptable to the Lord because it is labeled as Southern Gospel instead of Contemporary Christian Music or that **a popular Christian rock song could be made pleasing to our holy God by simply excluding the use of the drums.**\n\nEmphasis mine to show you where I'm getting this information.

The idea that *some* illness and affliction is a result of God's chastisement is pretty common, although it's frequently downplayed to distance most Christians from the asshats who blame pretty much everything bad on the person afflicted doing something wrong.  There's Biblical justification for that, both in the sense of worldly suffering being used to punish the lost and to discipline Christians.  So, that bit of theological justification for illness is still there in pretty much the same way that it's presented here.

If you are doing D\u0026amp;D-length combats, you may use the same skills because the narrative circumstances are constantly changing.

{"body":"Hell yeah Fish A! I was on A2 my 2nd year; best living experience at RIT. We had a good group of people on that floor and had a lot of fun. \n\nThe lounge at the north end of the building was converted into a quad when I was living there. It only had three students assigned to it the whole year. Even with 4, I think the space each person has is more than you get in a double room. You might get lucky and only have 3; which would be really awesome. Hard to say if you'll get assigned an additional student or not.\n\nAs far as doing homework in your room; you'll definitely have room to sit at your desk and do homework. I found that there were too many distractions for me in the dorms and couldn't focus as well (too many people and fun things to do), so I did all my homework either in the labs, library, or other quiet spaces on the academic side of campus. I found the separation really helped; when I was on the academic side I was there to do work, and when I was in the residential side I could relax and have fun. YMMV, but that's what worked really well for me and I even continued doing this once I moved off campus.\n\nI emailed my roommate once we got the assignments just to say hey, but it's kind of hard to talk to a random stranger over email. I ended up calling him a few weeks before move-in and we chatted about who would bring what for the room and whatnot. Other than that, we didn't talk a bunch until we actually moved in together. At the very least, do coordinate who brings what. You'll fill up the space really fast if you have 3 of everything.","score":"2","subreddit":"rit"}

If you can afford accessories, tattoos, a computer etc. you can afford to travel, even if its only domestic.

{"body":"Direct transcript:\n\nThis very morning I saw a video from Peter Day where he said his personal information has been stalked on the Internet. I can’t just avoid thinking that, no matter if you’re big or small on YouTube, if you’re public, you are going to be stalked to death by random strangers on the Internet. This is a trend that is running rampant over YouTube, and seems to affect some people who need their privacy respected, so I need to make a word about it.\n\n\nIf you expect any kind of silly, funny, JMAA fashioned video here, I’m sorry, but you won’t find it here, go away. There’s plenty of other videos you can see from me on that fashion. But this video is intended to be serious, because it’s a serious subject by itself and it even carries LEGAL consequences. However, if you still want to watch it, and you clearly support my words on this, which I might be sure some of you will do, then keep watching.\n\n\nSo there’s many cases of stalking on YouTube running around lately, specially on YouTubers who need their privacy respected. One case in particular is from I Hate Everything. A few days ago, he posted this video about his anxiety problems and his problems with stalkers online. There’s even a website blog dedicated to juice out all the personal information about him, his real face photos, and everything. And what these people don’t seem to understand is that this kind of actions online have SERIOUS legal consequences. Stalking someone online or in real life can get you into court, it can sentence you, according to at least the US laws, for harassment crimes legally.\n\n\nAlso for the fact that stalking people online can carry serious emotional problems to the victim.\n\n\nAnother case, and maybe I already covered this in my particular YouTube Inferno video, is Keemstar doxing Pyrocynical. He literally doxed Pyro for his real face photo, and personal information. And not to mention that, when he accused the 60 year old Runescape streamer for being a pedophile, his privacy has been invaded by his numerous DramaAlert fans. And let’s be clear on this: Keemstar’s vigilante shit is actual fucking bullshit. It can seriously sentence him for prison, and there’s even a news report on the US television where he is accused of doxing people online.\n\n\nThere may be other kinds of cases of stalking online on YouTube, but I need to tell this seriously, because this is a serious matter: if you see someone stalking a youtuber online and releasing his personal information, don’t stand for it. A youtuber’s channel is the divisory line between what’s personal information and what’s purely entertainment. A channel is only for the entertainment of an audience. A youtuber shares with you whatever he wants to share with you. He will NOT share any information that is deemed too personal, so that privacy must be respected.\n\n\nAnd I will see this particular thing coming with Keemstar as the hate towards him comes in, so let me clarify this: even if it’s Keemstar, even if Keemstar is the biggest cunt on the Internet, and even if I don’t particularly defend Keemstar on anything, I don’t think doxing or stalking Keemstar is the right thing to do. In fact, that’s stepping as low as Keemstar at this point. GradeAUnderA said that the combination of pedophile accusations and the invasion of privacy can even lead to SUICIDE.\n\n\nIf you stalk someone online, generally you WILL be legally punished. You can’t excuse it anyhow because you invade someone else’s privacy. And that, in almost all countries, if not ALL countries, is ILLEGAL. I can’t avoid fearing that if I’m ever getting bigger on YouTube, I will get my ass stalked to death, even if some things are no big secret from me. Of course, the bigger you get online, the more trolls and stalkers you’re gonna get, but this whole stalking trend as a whole must stop.\n\n\nI don’t want you to particularly hunt down all these people who stalk online, but I want these people and YouTube to pull out the head out of their asses and just stop this madness.\n\n\nBye.","score":"1","subreddit":"youtube"}

The first book in the Witcher series (haven't read beyond it yet) is definitely a man vs. nature story. Good/evil works best in man vs. man conflicts, although man vs. society can pull it off well, as well. Man vs. nature and/or self get too grey. However, fantasy novels work best with man vs. man conflicts. If you highlight society as your antagonistic force, you're ignoring all the potential fantasy has to be unique--after all, societies tend to be pretty similar in many regards. If you make the conflict man vs. self, that's an internal conflict entirely, so again, you miss opportunity. Man vs. nature has the chance to veer too far into the realm of imagination, becoming no longer accessible to most audiences. Who's willing to sit through chapters about inane fantastical trivia? If anyone were, then people wouldn't complain about Moby Dick's consistent whaling tidbits (pretty fantastical, although definitely about real things. Not *right* [I've been pilloried for not making that distinction before], but based on real things.) and readership of the Silmarillion would be far higher than it is. So man vs. man gives you the opportunity to differentiate from non-fantasy, but keeps the story relatable.","score":"11","subreddit":"books"}

Even though the story itself was not upvoted, I am happy to see that many people commented and participated in a discussion about its contents.\n\nI would like to disagree with your claim that Godwin's law is ever reached in this article. Godwin's law states that: \"As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazism or Hitler approaches.\" \n\nThere are two reasons Godwin's law cannot be reached in this article. Firstly, we are not dealing with an online discussion but an opinion text in a newspaper. I realize that these days, we use the term loosely to also apply to other media where *reductio ad Hitlerum* occurs.\n\nHowever, reductio ad Hitlerum does not occur in this article. It does refer to the historical period when Hitler was in power, but it focuses entirely on how countries like England, Canada, Austria, and Russia handled the refugee crisis spawned by the situation in Germany. In defense of the author, she never compares anyone to Nazis or Hitler. If so, she never commits reductio ad Hitlerum. That is why it is called *reductio ad Hitlerum*.\n\nIn defense of the author, she also states that it is not easy to make clear comparisons between historical periods. She just points out the general similarities between how countries responded to a large influx of refugees then and now. We do call the current crisis \"the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War,\" which isn't Godwin's law or reductio ad Hitlerum either, mind you.\n\nI realize it's easy to use terminology frivolously, especially if you disagree with something, but even in disagreeing with an opinion we should not be misapplying labels to it.\n\nAs for myself and the text, if you care, the thing I found most interesting about it was her idea that the issue is splitting Europe into various zones and the \"belts\" she talks about, but also how she puts it into the perspective of European identity. I would say I decided to share it more because of the second half of the text than its introduction.","score":"1","subreddit":"europe"}

I'd be surprised if there weren't a lot more like it that say the UK did more than talk to them. Should I look? Is that in question? My point was that because the UK played some role in Syria before any other EU state did, their paying for the cost of the crisis is slightly less unfair than it is for the rest of the EU. I made that point too strongly originally though, so thank you for the correction.\n\nIf the world were fair, the US and other countries involved (especially those who benefited) would deal with any humanitarian crisis they caused instead just causing these enormous disasters with no regard for consequences and then expecting Europe to be generous.

{"body":"\u0026gt;Turkey’s EU membership talks are set to be given a boost within a fortnight, after Britain abandoned its attempt to freeze the process of opening a new “negotiating chapter” with Ankara until after its EU referendum.\n\n\u0026gt;Although the step is largely a symbolic political concession to Ankara agreed as part of its migration deal with the EU, the process has taken on extreme sensitivity for London because of the referendum campaign, where Leave campaigners have attempted to raise fears of a new wave of migration prompted by Turkish accession. \n\n\u0026gt;At a meeting of diplomats on Tuesday morning, Britain was the only member state to refuse to give its consent for talks to begin with Ankara on financial and budgetary issues, in spite of its traditional standing as one of the biggest champions of Turkish membership talks. \n\n\u0026gt;However, London’s resistance only lasted a few hours, which means the formal opening of talks is expected on June 24 or 30, in line with the Turkey-EU deal.\n\n\u0026gt;The diplomatic acrobatics over membership underline the jitters in Downing Street over the issue, and its potential to blow up in the campaign. British support for Turkey’s largely moribund bid emerged as a central attack line for Leave campaigners, who claimed membership “is coming” and would open British borders to 80m potential migrants.\n\n\u0026gt;Diplomats in Brussels were surprised by both British resistance on opening a relatively innocuous chapter of talks — it was once the biggest champion of Turkish membership — and its sudden about-turn on Tuesday. “It is like they are scared of their own shadow,” said one eurozone diplomat.\n\n\u0026gt;In an attempt to kill the issue as a campaign topic, David Cameron has steadily hardened his language on Turkish membership in recent weeks, claiming at the current rate it would not be ready to join “until the year 3000”. However, he has stopped short of outright opposing accession, or offering a referendum on the issue.\n\n\u0026gt;Senior diplomats in Brussels almost universally think Turkish membership is unthinkable in the foreseeable future. All EU nations hold a veto on accession, some in private are implacably opposed, and France and Austria are legally bound to hold referendums on the issue if Turkey meets its membership criteria.\n\n\u0026gt;Turkey has also made barely any headway in meeting the EU’s membership criteria. It has closed just one of 35 negotiating chapters and the European Commission has noted it is going backwards in some areas, particularly regarding human rights and rule of law.\n\n\u0026gt;Several chapters remain frozen by Cyprus — with which Turkey has no official diplomatic relations — and were not opened as Turkey requested during its membership talks. One concession for Ankara was the opening of talks on budget and finance by the end of June, a chapter that had been blocked in the past by France.\n\n\u0026gt;Britain’s diplomats and civil service are operating under so-called purdah restrictions on government announcements, meaning they are unable to amend or adjust previously agreed positions on EU policy areas.

Because we would be the first safe country then.\n\u0026gt; \n\nIt just so happens that Ukrainian refugees would be easier and cheaper to deal with. I'm sure Italy and Greece would accept their fair share of Ukrainian refugees too. Either way, it's just a convenient hypothetical at this point.\n\nFact of the matter is that you're never going to get any country to agree to a deal like that. Except maybe, MAYBE, if the rest of EU is willing to pay an exorbitant sum of money, a lot more than just covering the expenses, so that the country hosting the migrants can make a profit from the arrangement. \n\n\u0026gt; This would really be a beneficial side effect because it would serve to force border states to either cooperate with detaining the migrants or risk harm to their economies by being fenced off.\n\nYou do realize that it is not only Italy's economy that would be harmed, right? That whole part of Europe is heavily economically interconnected from Milan to London, businesses on any side of the border would suffer. It's definitely not something the other countries could safely ignore. \n\nYou'll notice that UK has been complaining about the Calais situation even though all of it is happening on the French side, and they're separated not by a simple fence, but an entire body of water. And the Calais situation is relatively well contained in comparison to how a Greek-Macedonian border looked like, or how Italy-Austria would look like if you insist on walling off European countries and forcing them to do your bidding.\n\nPlans like this fundamentally lead to a situation where major European countries would be forced to actively start working against each other and undermine each other (not to mention the EU as a whole).

Which is why it's stupid.\n\nDon't try to shift the goalposts now. \n\nI have taken the position that Brexit voters had reasons for doing the things they did, reasons I think are valid. And I point them out. \n\nYou started with the point that they voted Brexit because they're stupid--likely because Farage and the Leave campaign lied to them and they bought it. Now you're talking about the problems deriving from the UK, and the EU having nothing at all to do with it.\n\nThat's just another slight variation on the 'stupid' voter theme--as if these people can't figure out what parts of their problems come from the EU, and what parts come from the UK.\n\nAt the same time, you then make this statement:\n\n\u0026gt; or take an aspirin (which is engaging in real deliberation and advocating real and positive solutions). \n\nwhich acknowledges that there *were* in fact real problems. It's just that the UK apparently didn't engage in a process to solve them. Like when the UK went to the EU to negotiate changes to issues it had with the EU, and was given nothing but token conciliatory changes that utterly failed to address its misgivings. \n\nIs that the 'aspirin' you mention? Or were they just meant to swallow the hardline the EU took with them?\n\n\u0026gt; the very real crises we are faced with at this point in history, are impossible to solve within the confines of national borders.\n\nThe very real crises [the EU] are faced with at this point in history are impossible *also* to solve within the confines of the EU. In fact, they still remain. \n\nIt's taken an open revolt to get a 'solution' for the immigration crises, even though that 'solution' contained a deal with the Devil and is widely being rejected by human rights organisations. Greece is still fucked... Even the IMF have condemned that 'solution'.\n\n\u0026gt; That's patriotic nonsense, that, at the end of the day, will be proven wrong.\n\nFunny hearing an Irishman be accused of English nationalism. I'm not a Unionist even slightly. \n\nYou just cannot accept that anybody would reject the EU approach to (not) solving problems. Ironically, you accuse me of the very thing that you're doing: which is being illogically patriotic, for the EU. \n\n\u0026gt; the only positive thing about this travesty is that it's a wake-up call\n\nIf there is anything it is not, it's a wake up call.

The sub is drowning in posts from people saying it's the wrong result, they should run it again, the world is going to end, Britain is going fall apart, etc etc.\n\nIt's like the entire history of the EU pre-Brexit ceased to exist.

{"body":"(Apologies for the wall of text)\n\nBecause I do not think that Canada can serve equitably as the state of both of our societies. The demographic balance of the country has tipped so decisively in favor of anglophones since confederation that the prospect of a truly bilingual and bi-national state is essentially impossible. As a minority of 8.2 million French speakers in a country of 35 million (and continent of 300+ million) English speakers, we lack the economic and social gravity to make learning French and interacting with French speakers worth it to the vast majority of Canadians, and as a result I cannot imagine the ideals of Trudeau Sr. ever coming to pass. This would be fine, I don't expect to be able to plop down and speak only French in BC, for example, but what is worrying is that Québec is finding it hard to compel its immigrants to adopt French as their language of choice in our province (French as the mother tongue of the province has declined, albeit slowly, [since 2006](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/98-314-x2011001-eng.cfm#a2)) and many who arrive on Québec's autonomous visas end up [skipping town](http://www.news1130.com/2015/04/01/investor-immigrants-using-quebec-as-back-door-to-vancouver/) to the rest of Canada anyway.\n\nI'm not raising this concern because I oppose immigration and want to stop it, quite the opposite actually, but it does raise a very real question about the long-term survival of French in Québec. Becoming a sovereign state would give French much more immediate power within our province, as it would be the majority language of *all* government institutions instead of simply that of the provincial level. Additionally, as a separate country, it would become much harder for new arrivals to just leave for the rest of Canada (frankly Vancouver would probably love for us to leave right now for just that reason).\n\nWhat is more, ignoring the question of language entirely, Québec is simply an entirely separate society from the rest of Canada. [Just look](https://imgur.com/gallery/w3uoK9W) at these to get an idea of the scale of this difference. The SNP and many Scots wish to leave the UK because they do not want their own society to be forced into things they don't agree with. Québec is in the exact same boat. We did not wish to participate in and be conscripted for WWI, but off we were sent, [though with much grumbling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_Crisis_of_1917). We have *still* never agreed to the constitution, and yet we are completely bound by it regardless. Simply put, we are not our own masters, and to remain a stateless nation in perpetuity is not amenable to our ambitions or conditions.\n\nI am not a separatist out of hatred for English Canadians, nor out of anger over Canada's past, but out of concern for Québec's future. Frankly, I think that both Québec and Canada would ultimately agree that separation was for the best once or if it comes to pass: we no longer have to worry for our identity's survival, and Canada doesn't have to deal with the burden of governmentally mandated bilingualism, threat of seperation, and transfer payments.

Remember than the power of the German economy is from exports. The trade balance between the two countries is much, much higher in favour of Germany than it was the year Spain joined the EU and is much higher than the proportional part that Spain receives from the money Germany contributes to the cohesion funds (the data is there, I'm on my phone now but you can look for yourself and do the math).\n\nWell, quick search anyway: Spain contributes 11B to the cohesion UE funds and receives 14B but only a part of that +3B difference comes from Germany. Last time I checked the trade imbalance was like 40B in favor of Germany. Spain also didn't need a 'rescue' (a loan after all) as a country from the EU, but it did got a banking one (that the government, not the bank, have to return, and its being returned). \n\nThere is also the question of qualified workers going to work on Germany thank to the EU single job market. I have three industrial engineer friends that are working on Germany. This is people that the Spanish government expent a lof of money on (public universities are only free for the student, not the taxpayers) and then go to produce wealth on Germany. Bad business for Spain but good for Germany.\n\nUnqualified workers doesn't go to so much to Germany because at that level the salaries are not that high compared with Spain and there is a lot of Turkish and Eastern europeans competing for them.

August**\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11821822/Germany-drops-EU-rules-to-allow-in-Syrian-refugees.html\n\n**Date: 31. August**\nhttps://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Mitschrift/Pressekonferenzen/2015/08/2015-08-31-pk-merkel.html\n\nCitation for you:\n\u0026gt; M: Concerning the question of Dublin III: Dublin III is the regulation that is in force, thus I greatly appreciate Hungary registering the refugees - something that not all countries are doing, one has to say; Hungary is doing this very well. I think it created a certain amount of confusion when we had an inner debate in Germany where several federal states stated that syrians have to be decided very quickly as pretty much all of them are genine refugees fleeing a war zone. The head of the Office for migration and refugees subsequently stated: Yes, syrians will be identified, afterwards they will have a very quick procedure to be accepted as a civil war refugee. This has resulted in the creation of the following impression: If a syrian comes to germany and can identify himself as syrian, he is welcome in Germany. This is in fact the reality, in the same way that someone from Kosovo most likely won't be allowed to stay. This has created the wrong assumption that all syrians should come to germany. This however is not the state of the law and we have already told this to the hungarian government which has to deal with the phenomen of syrians inside its borders saying \"let us go to Germany\". It is not the case that we could simply diverge from Dublin III, we don't have any other treaty on the issue. But if one country is building fences, a second country is allowing everyone to transit and a third country isn't registering everybody anymore, one has to say: If this state is the reality, we have to attempt to find a better one, a state where Law and Acting are in accordance again. But the legal basis for us and for the hungarian government is the one that is in force today [dublin III]. \n\nSo: please take your \"well known\" facts to the place where the sun never shines. Because that is exactly where they belong. ","score":"6","subreddit":"europe"}

{"body":"Your teacher is an idiot. \n\nAny religious tradition, especially those as established as Islam and Christianity, has a very complex exegetical and hermeneutical system, which can differ depending on the theological school. \n\nEven a \"literal\" reading of the sacred texts can't be divorced from the appropriate application of a historical-critical methodology, which takes into account the original writer (or writers) and original recipients of the message, considering their unique personal, social, political, economical and even linguistic reality. \n\nThe literary genre chosen also has a great impact in decoding the intended information. For example, reading about \"hair brighter than the sun\" within a poetic genre is obviously not factually accurate. The creation myth in the Bible is actually a creation poem, which should automatically lead you to understand that it is not to be read as a literal explanation for the origin of the cosmos. \n\nFurthermore, there's the hermeneutical work that needs to be applied. The particular text in analysis needs to be harmonized within the operating theological system, correlating underlying principles found throughout all the accepted texts, doctrine, laws and even tradition. \n\nTaking the texts at face value, without proper contextualization, gives you what we refer to as a fundamentalist reading, which is prone to a very shallow and inaccurate comprehension of what message is actually being transmitted.","score":"20","subreddit":"4chan"}

{"body":"I guess this needs some preface so my return to Christianity makes sense.\n\nI was raised Christian.  I was baptized Lutheran (ELCA then and still ELCA now after the ELCA/NALC split, if that matters at all), but I spent most of my time in the United Methodist Church.  Early in my middle school years, church camp was a thing for me, and I had those experiences of absolute awe that put me in tears every time I went to a church camp.  Now that I look back, I see that the atmosphere of those situations seemed to have been built to create that sort of emotion, and it wasn't anything that someone who studies religions and spirituality would find particularly moving; I wouldn't view it now as a truly spiritual experience, but I digress.  I would also be the kid that wanted to be a better Christian, but I was missing the point, more often than not.  I would be exactly what Jesus said not to be in regard to hypocracy.  Regardless, I deeply believed that God and Jesus were real and there was something there to be considered true (whatever it may be).  Let's just say that I was ignorant enough of what was going on, that in my sixth grade social studies class, I thought Yahweh was a city in the Middle East.  I kind of made a fool of myself to the teacher, but my peers knew no better somehow being convinced that I was the smartest one in the class (small town, and I was more hardworking and dedicated to schoolwork at the time).\n\nFast forward to the middle of seventh grade.  I had (and still have) this interest in constructing languages.  Because I wanted to learn more about it, I began researching languages.  I found myself lost in Wikipedia articles learning about various cultures, which then led to learning about different religions.  This continued until I learned that there are people that don't believe any religion:  atheists.  This was an entirely new concept to seventh grade me.  I began heavily research in this for whatever reason, and found myself in the middle of eighth grade as an atheist. \n\nI wasn't well versed in arguments, but I was convinced enough that evidence for God didn't exist at all.  I still had interest in religion though, so I continued research.  I was never really emotionally satisfied being an atheist.  However, I knew for certain that my intellect was serving me better than my emotions.  I learned more and more about both sides of the argument.  I can still ramble off rebuttals to a list of common theist arguments (which I still find useful because some really common arguments for God are just garbage arguments, in my opinion).  I also researched Islam and the Baha'i Faith a lot.\n\nFast forward around 4 years to about few months ago.  I've learned much much more about Deism, Islam, and the Baha'i Faith.  I also now have a girlfriend of a few months at the time who is Christian (Lutheran, attending a church on the NALC side of the split but not sure how she feels about the reason for the split).  I am now in this state where I am back and forth between atheism and deism because the arguments and counter arguments at this point were getting too complex for me to easily refute.  Eventually, I learn that my reasons were pretty garbage reasons for being a deist.  However, the Baha'i Faith had me convinced now due to the character of Baha'u'llah being unbelievably convincing to me.  I was about to officially convert to the Baha'i Faith, but a conversation with my (Christian) parents made me consider how Islam fit into the Baha'i view of religion.  To simplify what I saw, Islam didn't fit into the moral progression of the Abrahamic religions as the moral teachings of Christianity and the Baha'i Faith are closer together than those of Islam and the Baha'i Faith.\n\nSo, I was back to square one.  I had long since given up on Christianity.  However, the religion thing was becoming an issue between my girlfriend and I.  Nothing, earth-shattering as she was not going to leave me.  She knew going into the relationship that this religious journey was a big part of my life.  Because it caused some tension in our relationship that I wasn't Christian, I decided to give Christianity another look just in case.  I look at what's readily available to me in the world of YouTube apologetics, and I find the things I mentioned in [this comment on another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/4pcu34/whats_the_best_case_you_all_can_make_for_why/d4kcfv0).\n\nUltimately, these arguments with some additional support along with them are what had me convinced that Christianity, in some basic sense, was true.  Now, here I am.  I am almost going into my senior year of high school, and I'll be 17 in a week.  I am, at this point, looking at denominations and specific beliefs to try to figure out where I stand in Christianity.  Mainly, I am looking at Lutheranism and Anglicanism (and a little bit of Methodism).  I am also, at this point, studying other denominations such as Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox (and I am going to start researching Mormonism at some point, just out of curiousity); I just want to be informed about what I am dealing with there, though, I don't find them convincing for very fundamental reasons.  I wish not to start a flamewar here though.\n\nSo there's my story.

For this reason He promises:\n\n\u0026gt; ​“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.\nFor everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.\nOr which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?\nOr if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?\nIf you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!\n -Matt 7:7-11\n\nAs for worrying about Hell and the seeming unfairness of it all, I think the energy would be better spent in finding out who Jesus is and what He accomplished. Jesus did not come to condemn, but to save (Jn 3.17), and to give life (Jn 10.9-10).

{"body":"\u0026gt;Eternal punishment for temporal, finite sins on earth seems unjust.\n\nYou're right that would be unjust of God.  The problem is that sin is not a temporal, finite thing.  Sin is not some abstract moral concept.  Sin is qualitative and tangible.  So what is sin?  Sin is the transgression of the law, or sin is lawlessness (1 John 3:4).  What law do we transgress when we sin?  The law of God as revealed in Scripture; the ten commandments and any moral imperative given by God to men.  From Scripture we understand who God is and what He is like.  What we see in Scripture is a picture of what God is like.  The Anglican bishop J.C. Ryle defines sin in the following terms,\n\n\u0026gt;Sin is that vast moral disease which affects the whole human race...consists in doing, saying, thinking or imagining anything that is not in perfect conformity with the mind and law of God...The slightest outward or inward departure from absolute mathematical parallelism with God's revealed will and character, constitutes a sin, and at once makes us guilty in God's sight. (Ryle, Holiness, 11)\n\nSo we have a definition of sin.  Now who are the parties involved in sin?  Obviously man is the one who sins by commission or omission.  God is also party to sin because His law and His attributes are the ones transgressed against.  David speaks under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in Psalm 51, that great psalm of repentance, he says \"Against you and you only have I sinned.\"  This is after David sleeps with the wife of another man, impregnates her, and tries to cover up his sin by having her husband murdered.  How can David say that against God only he has sinned?  That's because Bathsheba and Uriah her husband have no source of morality in and of themselves.  They're not moral law-givers so they do not possess any laws for David to transgress.  God is the only law-giver so only He is the target of law-breaking, of sin.  \n\nTo finally address your concern about the duration of the punishment for sin let me say a few things.  First, God has determined that the just penalty for sin is death (Rom. 6:23a).  Why is this?  It is because God takes His character extremely seriously.  God is the source of all morality in the universe, He is the source of all goodness and beauty, He gives life and blessings to all of His creations.  To sin is to say to God that I can do better myself.  It is a failure to comply and to submit to the creator to whom you owe your very existence and allegiance.  Sin has pride at its root, it says \"I see your laws and I'd rather not obey.\"  Sin is the devaluing of what is most valuable, the trampling of the infinite worth and measure of God's character.  Sin is ingratitude for God's goodness and provision for your life.  Sin is the desire to be autonomous and declare oneself as god in place of the one true God.  God takes this rebellion, this treason, very seriously because His very character is being slandered and as the most glorious in all the universe God will not tolerate the slander of His name (read anything in the Old Testament to see this).\n\nSecond, the nature of the one sinned against.  You say it seems unjust for God to punish a finite sin with an infinite punishment.  This is a conclusion based on a false premise.  Sin is not finite or temporary.  Sin is committed against an eternal and infinite God who has always existed and always will.  Consider an analogy from human legal systems.  The punishment for a crime is always linked with the one the crime is committed against.  If, for example, I squash a spider in my house I have not committed any crime because our legal system placed zero value on the life of a spider, therefore I receive no punishment from the state.  If I get angry at my dog and kill my dog I will face animal cruelty charges and probably go to prison for a short period.  That is because we place more value on the life of a dog than that of a spider.  Now, let's say I get angry at another person and kill that person.  I am now facing murder charges and am found guilty.  I will go to prison for likely 30+ years.  That's because we value the life of another human more than the life of a dog.  Finally, if I assassinate a world leader then I am most definitely going to go to prison for life with no chance of parole and I may even face the death penalty.  That's because we place more value on the life of a world leader than the life of an average person because of the title they hold and the office they represent.  So in human legal systems the punishment is connected to the value of the victim of the crime.  The life of God is of infinite value therefore it stands to reason that an infinite punishment is appropriate.\n\nGod is committed to justice because He will not tolerate His name to be slandered or mocked in any way.  Therefore He will punish those who sin against Him and one sin is enough to condemn us to the lake of fire for all eternity where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.","score":"1","subreddit":"Christianity"}

{"body":"Baptism by immersion in water by one having authority is the first saving ordinance of the gospel and is necessary for an individual to become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and to receive eternal salvation. All who seek eternal life must follow the example of the Savior by being baptized and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n\nAdditional Information\nBaptism in the Lord's Way\n\nThe Savior revealed the true method of baptism to the Prophet Joseph Smith, making clear that the ordinance must be performed by one having priesthood authority and that it must be done by immersion:\n\n“The person who is called of God and has authority from Jesus Christ to baptize, shall go down into the water with the person who has presented himself or herself for baptism, and shall say, calling him or her by name: Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\n\n”Then shall he immerse him or her in the water, and come forth again out of the water“ (D\u0026amp;C 20:73–74).\n\nImmersion is symbolic of the death of a person's sinful life and the rebirth into a spiritual life, dedicated to the service of God and His children. It is also symbolic of death and resurrection. (See Romans 6:3–6.)\n\nThe Baptismal Covenant\n\nThose who are baptized enter into a covenant with God to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ, keep His commandments, and serve Him to the end (see Mosiah 18:8–10; D\u0026amp;C 20:37). Church members renew this covenant each time they partake of the sacrament (see D\u0026amp;C 20:77, 79).\n\nThose who keep the covenants they made at baptism are blessed by the Lord for their faithfulness. Some of the blessings include the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, the remission of sins, and the privilege of being spiritually reborn. If they continue faithfully, they are promised eternal life (see 2 Nephi 31:19–20).\n\nLittle Children and Baptism\n\nFrom latter-day revelation, we know that little children are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ. The Lord said, ”They cannot sin, for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable before me“ (see D\u0026amp;C 29:46–47). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which the Lord has revealed to be eight years of age (see D\u0026amp;C 68:27; Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 17:11). Anyone who claims that little children need baptism ”denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the atonement of him and the power of his redemption“ (Moroni 8:20; see also verses 8–19, 21–24).\n\nSee also Faith; Holy Ghost; Obedience; Priesthood; Repentance; Sacrament\n\n—See True to the Faith (2004), 21–26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom LDS.org","score":"1","subreddit":"Christianity"}

Their women have been taken - an entire nation carried away. Such terrible things have happened in Jewish history to ALL Jews, not just some. God punishes the Jews when they violate His Law, just as He in the end brings judgement to all all nations and all civilizations. Jews today are accursed for rejecting Jesus Christ. They are under the condemnation of the Law and can only be saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nOur civilizations which are turning rapidly away from God in these times are bringing upon themselves similar judgements.

The Jews fully deserved the judgement of God upon them, and have throughout their history each time they received it. Hitler was not a moral man for doing what he did, he did it with evil intentions, but they served God's purposes as far as He did intend for the Jews to suffer. The continued scattering of the Jewish people was a curse of God. The persecution they suffered at the hands of the Catholic church throughout a thousand years of its history - a church whose authority I by no means recognize - was a curse upon them which God allowed to be manifest even through a church which I do not recognize as Biblical.\n\nThe destruction of America, England, and Europe at the hands of heathen conquerors and plunderers which shall despoil their goods, take their women, slaughter their men, and enslave their children, will be a judgement of God upon them.

God wants his true servants to be recognized so that people know how to follow Christ. God doesn't get involved with frauds, and woe unto them if they die without repenting. Fake Christians are a very biblical concept. Jesus warned of wolves in sheep's clothing -- the sheep reference isn't there coincidentally, regardless of how little that is acknowledged. And Paul goes on to talk about false brethren, people who either had no sincerity to begin with, or, also, in my opinion, the unrepentant who continued to put up a front of being submissive to the Lord and his will. It has nothing to do with weak prayer. And if you ask me, as far as I know, the reputable healers in NAR with visible ministries (Sondergaard, Loud, Fischer, Cabrera, etc., and all on YouTube) would never say \"let's just wait and see what happens\" for any threatening length of time if the healing wasn't immediate. It's like snake-handling. God doesn't want people testing him and reading the Bible in such a nonsensically literal way, and he's not about to step in to encourage the continuation of that practice. If these people had any healing connection to begin with, they wouldn't be callous fundamentalists with their little personality cults and inner circles.

The real miracle by the grace is God is that they can live another day to repent in spite of all the harm they do. God's wrath will come when the world is beyond hope and humanity has embraced the Son of Perdition.

Peter, James and John would not have been the lowest strata of a peasant society because they appear to have owned boats and had hired men working for them. (If they were followers of John the Baptist they may even have had some synagogue training over and above what a “lowly peasant” normally receives.) Jesus preached to thousands of people even attracting disaffected Pharisees and disaffected scribes. The Apostle Paul was an educated man and a first rate intellect. \n\n\nHuman ties were not held in contempt. When Paul wrote his letter to the Corinthians he asked, “Do we not have the right to our food and drink? Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as the other Apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas (Peter)?” Yes, Peter was married and his wife accompanied him on his evangelical journeys.\n\n\n\nHanging on a cross and knowing that all was fulfilled, and knowing His work on earth was completed, Jesus emphatically declares \"My God! My God! Why hast thou forsaken me?\" so those listening would know that He was truly man and had the authority to be a [propitiation](http://www.theopedia.com/propitiation) for earthly man. Before giving up His spirit, Jesus finally said, “It is finished.” so those listening would know that Jesus was truly the Messiah, with authority to please God and redeem man. \n\n\nThe consequences man not following God’s will in Paradise, are that man must now work the land by the sweat of his brow; he must build the home; he must plow and plant; he must invent; he must work with hand and brain; he must overcome the difficulties and obstructions he has placed before himself; he must struggle against the forces of a fallen earth until Jesus comes back and restores man and the earth back to it’s original state – Paradise. This is man’s hope and God’s will.\n\n\n","score":"2","subreddit":"Christianity"}

{"body":"I have had many many panic attacks.  The trick to managing them is to remind yourself that in the grand scheme of things they are really not that big of a deal.  The more you stress about your stress, the worse the attacks will be.  \n\nWhat is a panic attack?  You feel really terrible for however long it lasts, then your mind calms and you get a period of time where you can really think about your problems clearly.  If you ever have another one, find a place that you feel safe and can either be alone or with someone who is really supportive and that you really trust (I like to shut myself alone in the closet - I find the darkness and the smell of clean laundry comforting), and just let your mind and body do whatever they've got to do.  If you need to dry heave or throw up, do it.  If you need to think the same thing over and over until it doesn't make sense anymore and then it makes sense again, just do it.  Instead of worrying about how many times you threw up (I'm impressed you had the presence of mind to count that high!), or exactly how long you've been having symptoms, just let yourself throw up as needed and let the time pass and then let it all go.  Remind yourself that you are having a panic attack, that panic attacks don't last forever, and that they don't kill people.  And just ride it out.\n\nAs for the verse you quoted, Phillipian's 4:6-7 \" 6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus,\" I don't think that Paul was telling us that it is sinful to have anxiety.  I think that he was attempting to comfort us by saying that instead of just being anxious about something, we can pray about it.  \n\nSo you had an anxiety attack and you were uncomfortable for a few hours.  You prayed for it to end and for the symptoms to go away *and they did.*  Many Christians who loose faith do so because they think that being Christian ought to exempt them from all human suffering and if they are suffering then God must not be real.  This is silly.  Being Christian does not change the amount that we suffer as human beings on this Earth, it changes how we *react* to suffering.  We pray.  We know we do not suffer alone, for God who loves us suffers with us.  And we ride it out.  And afterwards we experience God's peace either in this life or the next.  \n\nAn anxiety attack can be a terrible experience, but it is a terrible experience that passes.  Dwelling on it will make it worse.  Accept it as a part of your past and don't let it change your definition of yourself, or your faith in God.","score":"2","subreddit":"Christianity"}

I really don't have much more to say besides that.\n\nIf you are keeping up with my other comments, you'll notice I refer to the book of Acts a lot. Acts is the Biblical account of the how the first Christians behaved after Jesus' death - it makes sense to us that we should follow their example in what they did. Over and over in the book of Acts, speaking in tongues is referenced in relation to receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. For example, see [Acts 19:1-6] in which Paul specifically asked if the believers had received the Holy Ghost, and then he prayed with them until they spoke in tongues. When the book of Acts mentions people receiving the Holy Ghost but not speaking in tongues, it almost always says something to the effect of \"they *saw* that they had received the Holy Ghost.\" How else could one *see* someone else receive the Holy Ghost unless there was a visible sign? And the only visible sign we see in the Bible associated with the Holy Ghost is speaking in other tongues.\n\nIn response to your question about people being bound for hellfire - Jesus told us to judge not lest we be judged. As I mentioned in another comment, I'm not in the habit of judging whether anyone else is going to heaven or not, because I'm not God.

He speaks things into existence that weren't previously there and He makes them in their complete and finished form. This is not the case with both the theory of evolution and the big bang theory, which says that the creation we see today is the finished product of millions or billions of years.\n\nNow let's look at the visible manifestation of our invisible God, His Son Jesus who took on a human body and was filled with the power of God's Holy Spirit from birth. Jesus first miracle was turning water into wine. If we break this down and really think about it, Jesus was skipping many years of fermentation and aging to create the perfect wine in literally minutes, simply by the word of His mouth. \n\nThis is pretty much the same case with the creation of Earth and humans. God didn't create babies in the garden and then raised them for 20 or so years before they could comprehend the command of God and disobey it to obey the Devil. No, God created them as fully developed humans, He didn't have to wait 20 or 30 years for them to mature, He's simply God and speaks things into existence. The same with the Earth. God doesn't have to endure a billion year long cycle of evolution to create a perfect Earth with fully evolved plants and animals, evolution is not necessary with an omnipotent God. He doesn't have to wait a billion years to have an Earth that to the human eye would take a billion years to form, just like Jesus didn't have to wait 10 or 20 years to mature the perfect wine for His first miracle at the wedding when He turned water into wine. God just speaks and amazing things happen, which is what happened in Genesis, God literally spoke things into existence.

The very first prayer I made was for God to help point out the rights and the wrongs of the world and how to know the difference.  This was a similar prayer to what Solomon asked for.  Solomon asked for wisdom on how to lead his people right in the eyes of God.  God was pleased that Solomon asked for this instead of asking for riches, long life, or death to his enemies, so he decided to give him riches and long life as well. (1 Kings 3:1-15)\n\nSo..three days after I made that prayer,  I had an adverse reaction to drugs,  cried out to God for help, and a voice started speaking to me. Told me what was happening was caused by demons, they were about to have some serious effects on me, and I was going to need to accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, repent from my sins, and he would help me.   I did that and immediately felt the power of the Holy Spirit completely fill me up.  \n\nThe next day I woke up and my addictions to drugs and nicotine were gone.  I had a more positive attitude about life.  My opinions of what is \"right\" and \"wrong\" completely changed on all sorts of things.  Seems the answer to that first prayer I made was a \"baptism of the Holy Spirit and *fire*\".  The fire completely burned up my desires for sin.   I stopped watching television, listening to secular music, playing violent video games, cussing, among other things.  \n\nSo what I gather, is that people that God helps, are people who have a desire of absolute holiness and who \"turn from all their wicked ways.\"\n\nAnother experience I had was when I was having an anxiety attack.  God sent an angel who calmed me down.  He assured me that I have a pure heart and am loved by God, and I shouldn't be feeling so bad in my current situation.  \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.\" Matthew 5:8","score":"3","subreddit":"Christianity"}

We have seen how difficult it is to find a dynamic young arm at the front of your rotation...and that is exactly what Espinoza aims to be. The guys I want on this team long term are Espinoza, Swihart, one of Moncada or Benintendi.\n\nThat said, I'm not moving these dudes for Rich Hill or Fister. We have a black hole in the minors for any young arms coming up soon to help the big club, make a move for someone fully legit. \n\nHarvey is the guy I want and could see happening because I don't think the mets have any intention of signing him and his value took at least a minor hit with his struggles early on. Problem there is that our trading chips are in the low minors and the Mets are contenders who would look for MLB help as well. This is also where the Swihart injury hurts(but actually might save us from dealing davey). Swihart is the catcher I want on this team going forward, AS A CATCHER. Vazquez is a stellar defensive catcher, however, Swihart has always projected to be an above average defensive catcher and stud(behind the plate) with the bat. Depending on the injury there (I think it's probably season ending) I would call them with Vazquez, Rutledge or Holt, Castillo(we eat money), Devers, Kopech, and Chavis. In return for Harvey, one of their lower ranked 3b prospects Garcia/Urena, and a bag of balls or L screen to even things out. See if they hang up on you or are willing to talk. \n\n\n\nObviously Dombrowski should be talking to the Marlins about Fernandez, White Sox on Sale but one of those would take a ton and the other would take a ton and seems very very unlikely. Other guys to kick tires on are Salazar or Carrasco, and my dude Yordano. Non-starter wise, Vizcaino would be cool.","score":"6","subreddit":"redsox"}

I'm not sure thats the same as you're making it out to be.\n\nMost people are against making casual racist statements. What people are not at all in agreement of is the more subtle forms of racism, or if it accounts for racism or ignorance. \n\nCasually asking a black girl only a bunch of hip hop artists as examples of music she would like could be seen as a form of racism, why would someone black only like 'black' music? But it could also just be seen as ignorance from someone who has little to no contact with black people.\n\nA lot of lefties would accuse that person of racism, while a lot on the right would be more forgiving. You are missing this nuance in your casual dismissals of the discussion.\n\nYou keep trying to make a false statement that society is in agreement on what accounts for racism or not. It isn't that simple. Just look at the current immigration debate. Some on the left don't even believe we can have this debate without indulging in xenophobia. I'm sure you'll say \"not me\" or whatever, but that doesn't remedy that fact. \n\nSo, racism or other forms of intolerance is a social negotiation of what accounts for acceptable speech and not. To deny that there is an inflation of racism accusations today is silly, and it is also to deny that the left is the leader in these witchhunts, which goes back to our original point about intolerance.

Hardly a significant fluctuation, and certainly 1.4% against the dollar is far from the 9% figure mentioned by the BoE. You'll also note that the pound has been falling against the dollar since June, a trend that is self-evidently not caused by the Brexit bogeyman, and has actually made *gains* since Feb, even after the past week's sharp falls. \n\nFurthermore, there are issues with the methodology used by the BoE in its most recent inflation report, most notably the very convenient selection of a timeframe, so as to compare current figures to November's prominent peak. A peak, we might add, that occurred a full quarter before the referendum was announced, thus making it a particularly disingenuous point of reference. I'd also note that the methodology used for determining the impact of the referendum on the market is extremely squishy and not particularly well-demonstrated.\n\nThat said, referendum uncertainties and concern over a Leave vote have certainly had an impact on the pound, particularly vs the euro.

ESI, negative mode, acidic MP, m/z 99/101 all the basics are there and I'm presuming you've checked out EPA 331/332 as a reference. The method I use specifically is based on Pisarenko, et al. Analytica Chimica Acta 659 (2010) 216–223. Pisarenko and Snyder more or less wrote the book on this type of analysis, but nearly all the work I've read up on uses triple quads, presumably because of the sensitivity requirements. \n\nUnfortunately I'm not familiar enough with the LTQ to offer much specifically about the model. Though I can say in general source hygiene seems to matter more in negative mode work and I know the Thermo rigs in my lab have a \"transfer tube\" that's often in need of cleaning. It is certainly possible some of the source voltages might not be quite right, particularly if this is a novel analyte for your set up. I know it feels a little like cheating, but that's the advantage of \"auto-tune\" functions on newer instruments, they'll tweak voltages you don't even know about to get a good approximate tune. \n\nAlso try cutting back on the acid, I run 0.1% formic as my mobile phase. You will also run into trouble if certain other modifiers like TEA or HFBA have recently been used on your system. A lot of my troubles with the test came back to modifiers and hygiene. \n\nGood luck getting this sorted out and fire away with questions, I'm slowly but surely turning into \"bleach guy\" at work so this is right up my alley.

I think that some people tend to sell the easywalk as this magic bullet that will solve all your loose-leash woes. It will never be a cure to a pulling dog - using an easywalk without actively training your dog to walk nicely is like masking the symptoms (a dog that wants to pull will keep pulling in spite of the harness, and risks hurting himself in the process). Ideally you only use the easywalk in conjunction with training, and phase it out as your dog gets better with loose-leash walking (which, admittedly, can take a long-ass time, like with my pulling machine). \n\nThe easywalk harness was literally my last ditch effort with my dog after a particularly bad bout of incessant pulling and lunging made my arms so sore that I couldn't stand to take him out anymore. It was a crutch, but it was a crutch I needed at the time.

Agility, dock diving, obedience, etc?\n\n\nBe aware that young adult labs aren't always great on chilling out until they reach adulthood. \"Whirlwind of destruction\" is one way I've heard them described. Also, because labs are incredibly mouthy, I recommend crating when you're not around so your dog doesn't eat the walls or something. You'll want to be able to let the dog out of the crate for potty and a bit of exercise every 4 - 5 hours.\n\n\nI would recommend against the beagle because they can be very vocal and stubborn. Same deal with a corgi, although I've met several people who have made it work. If you can get control of the barking from day one you might be okay. However, a corgi may need more training than you want to provide. Someone more familiar with the breed might chime in.\n\n\nStrongly recommend against the border collie. Based on the fact you don't seem overly interested in advanced training and you seem to want a dog that can learn to chill out and just be a pet, a border collie should be near the bottom of the list of dogs to get. Border collies are generally not \"just\" pets--they are active dogs that need some kind of job, usually a sport of some kind in the context of urban or suburban living. It's not impossible to keep a BC in an apartment, it's just challenging. I think you'd be happier staying away from this breed.

Indiscriminate shock collar use, especially by amateurs, often causes way more problems than it solves.\n\nAside from that, one thing I'd do right now is get a different leash/collar setup. Retractable leashes are generally not a great thing for large dogs at all, and definitely not for prey-driven large dogs. Sometimes it takes a few tries to find the best leash/collar/harness solution, but the first thing I'd personally try here would be a no-pull harness and a strong leash not more than 6 feet in length. \n\nIf at all possible, though, the primary thing I'd recommend is getting either a dog walker, or finding a way to send this dog to dog daycare. Training and an appropriate harness/leash setup can really improve things, but ultimately some dogs just aren't a good fit for being walked by some people, and this really goes double for any working breed dog with high prey drive. It's challenging for me to walk one of my dogs because she is so prey driven and I just don't weigh enough in comparison to her to hold her back like my husband can.

{"body":"Ok, lots of questions.\n\nI love dealing the mixed games. I can deal them all. I'd say it depends on whether is live or tourney too. In live, I love dealing PLO for the tips and LOm8 for the fun. In tourney, I love dealing any mix, HORSE, Dealer's Choice, 2-7 etc. It breaks up the monotony. I like badeucey a lot. Stud games are a bit more stressful because of how easy it is to make mistakes.\n\nBiggest tip I've received thus far is $300 from a player I doubled up three times in a single down and he went on to place third in a  big tournament. I'm hoping that changes this year though /wink.\n\nMy biggest surprise when dealing with pros is that most of them are actually really nice. Negreanu always surprises me with how quiet he is. I try to keep quiet at pro tables, I do wish they were more chatty with the dealer sometimes because it can get boring. Most of them are married, that was surprising. It's really quite lowkey because what you see on TV is edited to get all the funny parts. I've dealt entire downs to pros with little said by anyone.\n\nOne piece? Sheesh, I want to write a whole book on how to be a friend to the dealer. Maybe the number one thing is pay attention to where you are putting your blinds, folds, and bets. If you put your blond directly in my pitching path, cards will bounce in front of your blinds, not come directly to your hands. If I can barely reach your bets and have to use my extended pinky to sweep it in, fuck you, this kills our backs. If the muck in under my left hand, don't throw your fold across the table Seat 2, you unattentive fuck.\n\nAlso, figure out your tipping strategy and stick to it. Be a person who tips a dollar every hand no matter what, or if you don't tip every hand if the pot is small, tip more for bigger pots. The issue here is, whether the pot is big or small, I have to do the same amount of work. This is why I'd rather get a dollar every hand, then a redbird for a big pit all day, every day.","score":"2","subreddit":"poker"}

(Which Conor has a much higher chance in winning when compared to the Nate rematch.) \n\nI think there's a real high chance of Conor being KO'd in the Nate rematch. Lets not act as if Conor didn't save himself by shooting for the takedown. He shot for that sloppy takedown for a reason. Every fight is different, but I do NOT see Conor beating Diaz.

At the registrar I would set the hypothetical nameservers to ns1.fakehost.com and ns2.fakehost.com. When someone looks up example.com, those nameservers would point them to the associated DNS records that would define where the site is hosted, what email service is being used, what subdomains there are, etc. There'll likely be an *Address Record* (or *A Record*) for example.com that points to the IP address of the server where the site is actually hosted.\n\nIn real life it can get substantially more complex than that (for example, the A record might be pointing to a load balancer and there are really 9 copies of the site distributed on 12 different servers or some other configuration of exponentially greater complexity), but that's pretty much the gist of it.","score":"2","subreddit":"Wordpress"}

{"body":"\u0026gt;Il faut que les demandeurs d'asile puissent prouver qu'ils sont persécutés\n\nLà nous sommes d'accord. Cette obligation découle de l'article premier A de [la convention de Genève de 1951](http://www.cnda.fr/content/download/35155/303176/version/1/file/C0%20Convention%20de%20Geneve%201957.pdf), tel que modifié par [le protocole additionnel de 1967](http://www.cnda.fr/content/download/35250/304109/version/1/file/D%202%20Protocole-de-new-york-1967.pdf).\n\n\u0026gt;Aux fins de la présente Convention, le terme “réfugié” s’appliquera à toute\npersonne :\n\n\u0026gt;[...]\n\n\n\u0026gt;(2) Qui, craignant avec raison d’être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un certain groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques, se trouve hors du pays dont elle a la nationalité et qui ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays [...].\n\nA cela le droit européen étend une protection plus faible, dite subsidiaire, aux personnes remplissant les critères suivants ([Directive \"Qualification\" 2011/95/UE](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:337:0009:0026:fr:PDF)) :\n\n\u0026gt;Article 2 : Définitions\n\n\u0026gt;Aux fins de la présente directive, on entend par:\n\n\u0026gt;[...]\n\n\u0026gt;«personne pouvant bénéficier de la protection subsidiaire», tout ressortissant d’un pays tiers ou tout apatride qui ne peut être considéré comme un réfugié, mais pour lequel **il y a des motifs sérieux et avérés** de croire que la personne concernée, si elle était renvoyée dans son pays d’origine ou, dans le cas d’un apatride, dans le pays dans lequel il avait sa résidence habituelle, courrait **un risque réel de subir les atteintes graves** définies à l’article 15, l’article 17, paragraphes 1 et 2, n’étant pas applicable à cette personne, et cette personne ne pouvant pas ou, compte tenu de ce risque, n’étant pas disposée à se prévaloir de la protection de ce pays.\n\nLe problème est donc de savoir comment on examine ces demandes d'asile ou de protection subsidiaire. Comme la vie est bien faite, il existe des textes européens qui règlent cette question, à savoir [la Directive \"Accueil\" dans sa version du 26 juin 2013 (2013/32/UE)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:180:0060:0095:FR:PDF).\n\nPour dire les choses rapidement, les demandeurs bénéficient d'un droit à rester sur le territoire de l'Etat membre pendant la durée d'examen de leur demande.\n\n\u0026gt; Article 9 : Droit de rester dans l’État membre pendant l’examen de la demande\n\n\u0026gt; 1. Les demandeurs sont autorisés à rester dans l’État membre, aux seules fins de la procédure, jusqu’à ce que l’autorité responsable de la détermination se soit prononcée conformément aux procédures en première instance prévues au chapitre III. Ce droit de rester dans l’État membre ne constitue pas un droit à un titre de séjour.\n\nLa directive prévoit, outre le rejet pour motif de fond (absence de persécution), des motifs d'irrecevabilité de la demande. L'un de ces motifs tient à la qualification de *pays tiers européen sûr* (article 39).\n\nLa définition en est la suivante :\n\n\u0026gt;Un pays tiers ne peut être considéré comme un pays tiers sûr aux fins du paragraphe 1 que:\n\n\u0026gt;a) s’il a ratifié la convention de Genève sans aucune limitation géographique et s’il en respecte les dispositions;\n\n\u0026gt;b) s’il dispose d’une procédure d’asile prévue par la loi; et\n\n\n\u0026gt;c) s’il a ratifié la convention européenne de sauvegarde des droits de l’homme et des libertés fondamentales et s’il en respecte les dispositions, notamment les normes relatives aux recours effectifs.\n\nC'est particulièrement important car le paragraphe 1 prévoit que **l'entrée illégale depuis un *pays tiers européen sûr* est un motif de rejet automatique de la demande**, sans aucun examen et donc l'expulsion du territoire européen.\n\n\u0026gt; Les États membres peuvent prévoir qu’aucun examen, ou aucun examen complet, de la demande de protection internationale et de la sécurité du demandeur dans son cas particulier, tel que décrit au chapitre II, n’a lieu dans les cas où une autorité compétente a établi, en se fondant sur les faits, que le demandeur cherche à entrer, ou est entré, illégalement sur son territoire depuis un pays tiers sûr conformément au paragraphe 2.\n\nL'accord signé entre l'Union Européenne et la Turquie se fonde sur cette notion de *pays tiers européen sûr*, ce qui permet d'expulser vers la Turquie les demandeurs d'asile sans examen de leur demande. **Je dénie cette qualité à l'Etat turc**, car il est évident que la Turquie, s'il l'a ratifié, ne respecte pas la convention de Genève (2.a.) et s'il l'a ratifié, ne respecte pas la CESDH (2.c.).\n\nAinsi, l'expulsion vers la Turquie est illégal et les demandeurs d'asile doivent bénéficier d'un examen complet de leur demande sur le territoire de l'UE.\n\nSi jamais tu as encore des questions, on pourra aborder ensuite la qualification de réfugiés aux déplacés de guerre et la notion de protection subsidiaire en droit européen.\n","score":"2","subreddit":"france"}

Les pauvres migrants de Calais sont armés, s'entre-tuent entre communautés ethniques, brûlent leur camp et tous les services que les assos ont créés pour eux... et c'est évidemment de la faute de la France et de la police. D'ailleurs Mme Humbersot se vante que son service juridique (que les migrants ont brûlé) apportait du droit à cette zone de non-droit et de violence, et c'est très bien !.. mais ensuite elle précise qu'elle voulait dire droit de vivre en Angleterre (quoiqu'en pensent les Anglais et la loi britannique) et droit de ne pas avoir de plaies *infligées par les forces de police* (alors même qu'elle parlait d'affrontements *entre migrants* d'une violence largement plus grave que d'éventuels matraquages policiers - et surtout elle dit ça d'une manière absolue, peu importe ce que la personne a fait pour mériter ce traitement, comme par exemple fusiller ses voisins et mettre le feu à son camp - bref la police est coupable si elle n'intervient pas et elle est coupable si elle intervient). \n\n2. Elle *se plaint* que l'Etat ait fait arrêter des gens ayant commis des agressions contre des migrants, parce que comme ça ne va pas dans sa vision d'un Etat raciste, c'est forcément une manipulation pour cacher à quel point l'Etat est raciste. Logique.\n\n3. \"La crise à Calais ne va pas se terminer\", \"ce n'est pas la seule crise qui va arriver\" mais... \"les migrants ne sont pas des problèmes\". Moi j'ai plutôt tendance à penser que si accueillir des migrants mène à des \"crises\" de son propre aveu insolvables et de plus en plus nombreuses, c'est un petit peu... un problème.\n\nLe mot de la fin : \"Parce que des Français, à Calais, sans vouloir culpabiliser la France, y en a pas beaucoup.\" Effectivement, de nos jours il y a plutôt des Afghans et des Soudanais.","score":"5","subreddit":"france"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; Even at $300k there is something always faster so why would someone buy a car that is not the \"most\" fun to drive? Some folks love to actually be engaged with their car and a manual transmission is more fun IMHO.\n\nAs implied by your \"IMHO\", what is fun to drive for one is not necessarily what is fun to drive for another (and it can vary by situation). Note the GT3 RS in my flair - I've tracked that extensively. I've also spend seat time in a wide variety of cars, ranging from supercars to old POS cars that fell apart as I tracked them (sometimes literally). \n\nWhen running a car as high strung as a GT3 or an F430 Scuderia on track, weight transfer is critical. Even a moment's weight transfer causes a response from the suspension, and the response can be significant. There's a section at one of our local tracks where a tight hairpin brings me down to 2nd, and then as the track twists up a hill, I reach the top of 2nd and need 3rd. That needed shift causes weight transfer - clutching in stops the acceleration, which unloads the rear. The rear loses both traction and feedback from that. Then, the shift is complete, back on the throttle, and the front unloads - now the front has lost both traction and feedback. But the rear is still loading up, and isn't back to me yet. I lose feedback and a sense of connection with the track surface because of the weight transfer caused by shifting. I have to take the turns slower because of that weight transfer. The car could handle more pace, could stay more connected, could give me better feedback if it could shift without any weight transfer. PDK can shift without any weight transfer. In a fast / stiff track car, PDK is more fun for me than a traditional manual, all else being equal, because of the disconnection the unloading of the suspension causes.\n\nI appreciate that there are times and places when a manual is more fun. I prefer a manual in my back-roads car. I prefer a manual in my MX-5. But in a $300,000 supercar, with what I'd probably do with it, a good DCT is more fun for me.","score":"17","subreddit":"cars"}

This basically makes it a voltage divider, you can google those if you'd like to know more.\n\nBut what this means is that one terminal should have 5v to it, one should have 0v (ground), and the last should sweep up and down as you move the throttle. If I were troubleshooting a TPS and didn't know the pin out, I would put the negative terminal of my multimeter on the battery ground terminal. Then I would put the positive lead on each terminal and sweep the throttle.\n\n1. Should stay at 0v (no difference in voltage between battery ground and ground pin on the TPS).\n2. Should stay at 5v no matter where the throttle is.\n3. Should sweep from 0-5v as you move the throttle.\n\nIf you find the ground and 5v terminals are fine but the signal terminal doesn't change with the throttle position then the TPS is probably bad. If you find that you either don't have a good ground or don't have 5v then you have a wiring or ECU problem first.","score":"2","subreddit":"cars"}

I tried to explain to him that a full exhaust on an old 302 isn't going to give him 50hp like the box suggests.

I was quick to call him out on his shit. Told him straight to his face that it would be lucky to have 430bhp. It had no F/I, factory cams, factory intake, and factory manifolds.

Had 90k miles and he wanted 23k for it. \n\nWhen I asked to check out the car, the asshat who got the keys started it and immediately began revving the shit out of it while it was cold like I was supposed to be in awe or some shit. \"Its a rocket under the hood!\" he said.

The driveshaft is also already sitting at an angle, so raising the engine is not a good option as it would begin to interfere with the floor pan. Not to mention that there isn't a good business case here: sports coupes do not sell well enough as is (Ignoring the pony cars as they're a different segment), and neither the Genesis not Z car, the BRZ's closest competitors, provide reasonable evidence of a market big enough to warrant engineering a turbo BRZ.","score":"11","subreddit":"cars"}

Also Bishop is a title given to an overseer of Churches - see 1 Timothy 3 of the New Testament (ἐπίσκοπος episkopos ep-is'-kop-os From G1909 and G4649 (in the sense of G1983); a superintendent, that is, Christian officer in general charge of a (or the) church (literally or figuratively): - bishop, overseer.) --222.155.91.5 23:49, 1 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nAnd who provides the authority to Eddie Long? The church is a farce. In fact the only church that has any 'authority' is the catholic church, and that's only cultural considering the non-existence of god. 60.234.146.211 01:27, 8 August 2007 (UTC)\n\nlol that's rather P.O.V.! Perhaps you have a Catholic background but Protestant Christians, 'culturally', disagree that only the Roman Catholic church has 'authority'. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 130.216.30.233 (talk) 09:13, 19 September 2007 (UTC)\n\nActually I think you'll find that Bishop Eddie L. Long has distanced himself from Brian Tamaki and the Destiny movement, which was painfully obvious with his absence from the last Labour weekend conference.202.14.107.1 (talk) 17:46, 8 April 2010 (UTC)Glen Lovegrove\"\n\n","score":"1","subreddit":"newzealand"}

{"body":"Good point.   /u/winnetouw, one practice you can do to back off a bit from just counting is to divide the breath into parts and make intentions to notice each part.   So when you notice the inbreath starting, intend to notice the end of the inbreath; when you notice the end of the inbreath, intend to notice the beginning of the outbreath, and so on.   You can also intend to notice the middle of the breaths if that helps, and the pauses between, which can be long enough to lose track.   If this is easy, try noticing how long each breath is.\n\nThe point is not to become an expert on the breath, but to keep your attention stable and yet energetic, while still maintaining the expanded awareness.   At some point you should be able to let go of all of this, keeping your attention stable and bright simply with your introspective awareness.","score":"1","subreddit":"Buddhism"}

He did win an Eisner once during that run, and a couple Wizard fan awards, so I think it can be seen as a generally positive response. Although with a run that long, I'm sure there were highs and lows in terms of fan reaction. \n\nMinus the awards, the same thing can be said about Slott's run on Spider-Man.\n\nI think the most drastic difference is the attention span of the average fan when it comes to long runs. It's so much shorter now than it was 20 years ago. \n\nPublishers have trained the fan base to always want the next hot new thing, and fans have bought into it hook line and sinker. The same phenomenon that makes a long run like Slott on Spidey an outlier gives us constant reboots and relaunches. \n\nThat being said, I seem to think it is mostly long term Spider-Man fans that were vocally against Slott when he started his run. How somebody can read Spider-Man through the Clone Saga but drop it because of Slott, that's beyond me.\n\nAnother big difference is Slott's online persona. I think it started before his Spidey run, but he often engaged in message board and twitter \"discussions\" with detractors of his work. Even if the criticisms weren't all that valid, Slott really tainted his reputation as a professional, and that probably still has an effect on how people view his run.

{"body":"\u0026gt; So, would you say in general, the most common result of contact between an immigrant group speaking one language and a native group speaking another is not any kind of major mutual influence on each other's languages but the languages staying mostly as is, with often assimilation into more or less speaking like the native speakers of the language that dominates (whether that be the immigrants assimilating to speaking like the natives of a land or the natives assimilating to speaking like the immigrants)?\n\nNo, I would say that the impact of language contact depends largely on the degree that communities are interacting and learning each other's language. Immigrant communities frequently learn the language of the host community, which has a bigger impact on their language. If we take it on a small scale: If 10 Norwegians are living in an English community of 1000, it's unlikely that most English-speakers are becoming fluent in Norwegian or hearing a lot of Norwegian-influenced English that could change their ideas about acceptability. Meanwhile, the Norwegians are constantly coming into contact with English and likely shifting to English for much of their daily lives. As a result, we're likely to see a lot of grammatical transfer from English into the new local Norwegian dialect. \n\n\u0026gt; And okay, German and English making a creole might not be the best example, but what about a bunch of different immigrants forming a creole from contact (say if a city has Irish, Italian, Polish and other speakers, forming a creole with all these languages in contact). After all, many US cities did have big waves of immigration from multiple regions (mainly European) living in the same city, not necessarily just one immigrant language contacting English.\n\nBut what we had were waves of immigrants from different places each encountering a well-established, large community of native English speakers. This was not the case in the British West Indies nor in Singapore, where the vast majority of the community were learners of English, not natives of English. This means that in the US, there was a lingua franca in place upon their arrival that the immigrants learned, while in the British West Indies and Singapore, the colonial circumstances privileged the learning of a transplanted language. Additionally, most of the children of the immigrants to the US learned English as their native language (though some communities, particularly Midwestern German-American communities, held out for a while), which wasn't true in either the British West Indies (where importation rather than reproduction was the dominant way of growing the slave labor force for a while) or in Singapore (where I believe children grew up not learning English, but rather their families' languages).","score":"3","subreddit":"linguistics"}

Make sure you keep your sleeping stuff super dry. \n\nThat being said, hiking North to South is WAY EASIER. Especially since you're carrying so much extra food on the food on the first couple of days. Trail is relatively easy. Keep in mind that I'm used to local mountain hiking where a couple of kilometres can take forever. The trail has almost no elevation gain/loss for the vast majority of it. But when it does, it comes in spades. \n\nBlisters and Bliss is a good read if you've never done the trail before, but as long as you've got a plan of where you want to camp each night you'll be fine. We did the trail in seven nights- started the trail around 8am every morning and done hiking by about noon every day.

What this results in is their team moving up the ground in waves, allowing them to all be caught out if they turn it over.  \n\nWhen we went forward though it would look more like a chain. We could run one after another linking up, with only 1 or two players required to overlap at any point. If we turn the ball over, then Collingwood run into the previous link in our chain. There's no chance to get over the back of the entire wave of players like their is for them.\n\nThe big difference in styles is that theyre trying to hold on to the ball more and give the opposition less chance to force a turn over. On a clean day this might work well, much like a hawthorn style gameplan. On a wet day where marks aren't guaranteed it can fall apart easily.\n\nKeep in mind Port also worked harder, there were times where the Pies players just didn't run hard enough to get back, or cover the right spots.

In Europe highways don't go through the centers of cities like they do in the US.\n\nThere was \"white flight\" in the 60's where white people picked up and moved out to the suburbs. If politicians listened more to white people than minorities, then they'd start to listen to the suburbs and ignore the inner cities.\n\nMinorities like blacks had been redlined into being able to live only in certain parts of towns and banks wouldn't give loans to people who lived in those parts of town so it was hard to get money to fix up black housing or build nicer houses to begin with.

At least it'd take a ton of bombs to wipe out suburbs.\n\nThe US likes to think of itself as a rural country with lots of farming. Big lawns go with that. Cities were historically dirty, filthy (antibiotics were developed in the late 30's and come to the public after the war, up to that point any stupid little infection could kill you), and full of disease and crime. Everyone wanted to get out and live in nature among big lawns. Many modernists up through the 60's saw ideal living as a tower of apartments in the middle of a park. Cities were supposed to be \"machines for living\" and machines are designed from plans that are simple and beautiful. They thought there should be a beautiful \"living\" area and then somewhere else for shopping and somewhere else for work, all beautiful separate parts like an engine, not mixed up mess of stuff blended together. This is where the design of projects came from and those ended up failing spectacularly.\n\nTalking about modernism the attitude of the post-war US was modernism in that new things were better and old stuff and old ways of doing things had to be cleared out. Old buildings like capitols and city halls were all remodeled and updated. It made sense at the time. The old ways of doing things led to horrible things like WWII after all.\n\nMost of the US is really new. Like 2/3 of the housing in the US was built after WWII. Cities were going up all over the place. People were moving west from the cities on the East Coast. (Even today still half the US lives in the Eastern Time Zone.) People having the boomer kids all at the same time. Tons of housing was needed and housing tract homes are basically mass-producing houses rather than building neighborhoods.\n\nHome-ownership was and is encouraged in the US. The FHA was created in the 30's to help give out mortgages and set standards to make home ownership more accessible. They set the rules and standards for the sorts of houses and developments that'd be able to have FHA assistance in getting people loans. One of the things they started encouraging was houses built on loops and cul-de-sacs rather than traditional street grids. \n\nSchools are locally funded. With that and cities, it was way easier to build neighborhoods from scratch in fields and start fresh than reform and update established places. Look at the problems with the cities like San Fransisco today. The people who live there keep laws from being passed that'd allow more than single family homes to be built so there are way more people wanting to move into the city than there are places for them to live. Also at the time construction of new houses and building and selling cars powered a good amount of the economy, keeping people employed. That was fine to help keeping going.","score":"26","subreddit":"urbanplanning"}

That's great.  But, even in this city and metro area, which has relatively abundant transit options compared to most of the US, there are still *a lot* of jobs and job centers that are severely undeserved by public transit.

Just change your milk and check the box), waffles, tofu scrambles, stewed black beans and toast, bagel and v cream cheese, fruit salad, it's not too big a deal once you find your new normal!\n\n3) My absolute favorite is TJ's unsweetened vanilla almond milk because it's cheap and tastes neutral.

Just check your ingredient lists (a great deal of conventional grocery store goods are vegan) and make the few adjustments to recipes where needed (v margarine for butter, plant milk for milk, flax eggs for eggs in baking, etc).\n\n5) I try to personally avoid any animal product because people have a difficult enough time with the very basic tenets of veganism and I think it's easier to just not consume any rather than make exceptions in front of people who don't think about any kind of animal product consumption critically and give them the wrong idea. However, although I keep agave around and don't reach for honey to add to things, if something has a trace amount of honey in it and that's the only animal product, plenty of vegans are willing to make exceptions there.

{"body":"If you're at all into fantasy writing or bad puns, I strongly recommend \"Hello, From the Magic Tavern\". The premise is that a guy from Earth falls into a portal to a magical land similar to Middle Earth or Narnia and he interviews random people from that world. It is about 95% improvised, and does an excellent job of keeping consistent with the lore week in and week out. \n\nIn a similar vein if you like character driven long form improv (you probably do and just don't know it yet), I suggest listening to a show like Comedy Bang Bang or in a similar vein, Spontaneanation. \n\nNow we're starting to get to the more obscure ones. Here in the lovely state of New Jersey we have an awesome listener supported free-form radio station called WFMU. That station had a program on in for 13 years called \"The Best Show on WFMU\" and it lived up to its name. In 2014 the show took a year hiatus, and return as a podcast, now just called \"The Best Show\" which you can get as a podcast or listen live every Tuesday from 9-12 Eastern (utc+6) . It is at its core a call in comedy show, where the host, Tom Scharpling is curmudgeonly in a lovable way, but there is so much more, including a series of puppets, frequent callers, live guests, and John Wurster, a sort of Costello to Scharpling's Abbot who does a long semiscripted call most episodes. \n\nLastly, the most hit or miss show I know of, Hollywood Handbook. The general idea of that show is that the hosts claim they are Hollywood insiders  with lots of celebrity connections, but in reality they tend to act and talk like 8 year olds doing impressions of actual Hollywood insiders. They occasionally will do high concept episodes that have little to nothing to do with Hollywood, but are amazingly funny. I find myself laughing not so much at anything specific as much as just the general ridiculousness. \n\nI hope you enjoy at least some of those shows.","score":"3","subreddit":"vegan"}

{"body":"Try this: Just do sun salutations for two weeks. Every day. Find a series that seems doable and just commit for the two weeks. Everything about a basic sun salutation will get you on the path to more advanced poses.\n\nAs a quick break down, you start standing and move to a forward fold. This stretches the legs and back muscles. Bend your knees if you need to and reach the floor and step back into a lunge. This works on your psoas muscle that is often directly related to low back problems. Step the other leg back into plank. This blasts the core. Hold it for five long deep breaths. Slowly lower down, keep your elbows tucked in and forearms straight as possible. This improves upper body strength. Come up into cobra (look for online videos for guides to a proper cobra). This is more back and core stuff. Push back into down dog. (More core stuff.) Ease into down dog. It's way more intense than most want to admit but you can dial it in to fit your level. Step forward with the same leg you stepped back with. This lunge hits the psoas on the other side. Step forward. Sweep up. Repeat, alternating with the leg you start with.\n\nNotice how much of that has to do with the back? Funny thing is if you go to a back-type doctor or chiropractor, they will usually hand you a list of exercises. Usually about 80% of them are yoga poses. \n\nMost importantly, dial it in. Don't shoot for the Instagram version of the final pose right off the bat. Work up to it. Flexibility takes time. Give yourself a chance to develop and progress. You mentioned pigeon. I know instructors who won't touch pigeon in classes due to the danger to the knees. It's definitely a pose you have to work up to. You wouldn't go to a crossfit class and expect to run with the group that's been doing 3 days a week for a year. Give yourself a chance to progress.\n\nAs for the \"spiritual bullshit\", you mention IT so I'll take advantage of this analogy: Your body is the hardware. The poses work the hardware. Your mind is the software. The pranayama and breathing works the software. It gives you CONTROL of the software. Why would you not want to bolster the software along with the hardware and vice versa. \n\nYou don't have to buy into the \"New Age\" version of the spiritual bullshit. Look for the lessons on pranayama specifically and work on breath control and basic meditation. Basic yoga is geared towards relaxing the body AND the mind and why wouldn't you want that? \n\nSorry for the rant but I am in my forties and went to yoga because of my lower back and knees and it worked.

OK, well this article (and others like it) is misrepresentative of the situation.  \n  \nThe article isn't untruthful - 57% is the correct percentage, but:  \n\n  * It doesn't give any statistical background provided to help us things in context^†, and;  \n\n  * It uses a percentage figure to report a change in cases without giving us the figures that percentage is based on.  \n  \nWhy statistical background? The 57% figure refers to 85 reports of hate crimes to True Vision, a police-funded reporting website, between Thursday and Sunday last week compared with 54 since the same period the previous month - an increase of 31 reports. Clearly this isn't good, but without knowing what the background level of hate crimes we don't now if this is significant, or just natural variation. The article doesn't provide any historical background, and the figures themselves are cherry-picked. How, for example, does the same period last month fit into the overall picture? We don't know. And as we don't know that we can't make a reasonable extrapolation to say if this is an increase to be slightly concerned about, or very concerned about.  \n\n \nWhy give us the figures the percentage is based on? Because 57% on its own doesn't really tell you very much. If I tell you my wages increased last week by a 1000% then that sounds brilliant, until I tell you that I don't have a wage. Both figures are correct but you need both figures - plus the background - to make proper sense of what's going on. Without knowing both how the percentage is derived and the background figures we are left with a figure that's difficult to interpret, especially if we remember that the media will tend to report changes in figures in whichever form best suits the argument they are making. If the percentage change is small and the numbers are generally large (e.g. stock market) then the numbers will get reported, if the percentage change is large and the numbers involved are small the percentage will tend to get reported.  \n  \nObviously any increase in hate crimes is unwelcome and should be met with a robust - but non-escalatory - response from members of the public and be dealt with quickly by the police. I'm only citing this case because it's an example of a wider problem about the use of numbers in political debate.  \n  \nIt's also an example of how talk about media misrepresentation is fine but until you start taking the figures apart, getting historical context, being aware that figures may be picked to push a particular agenda and may not represent a balanced view of events then you're being led around by the nose just as much as a S*n reader who believes everything they read.  \n  \n^† ^A ^common ^factor ^between ^the ^debate ^about ^increased ^racism ^and ^the ^debate ^about ^the ^markets ^is ^the ^lack ^of ^historical ^perspective ^on ^the ^figures ^being ^cited.  \n^‡ ^This ^is ^something ^we ^accuse ^S*n ^readers ^of ^quite ^a ^bit, ^but ^I ^would ^suggest ^it ^behoves ^us ^all ^to ^remember ^the ^beam ^in ^our ^own ^eyes ^before ^you ^worrying ^about ^the ^mote ^in ^someone ^else's.","score":"-4","subreddit":"unitedkingdom"}

{"body":"I'm yet to see a constructive and compelling argument for why we should leave. \n\nI have seen academics and professionals say that leaving will end up with our economy tanking, our job market suffering. I've read papers that say that immigration is a (much needed) net benefit to the country, and foreign newspaper articles discussing their issues as qualified people flock to the UK.\n\nI live with an NHS recruiter (foreign EU citizen) who works in an office in London where the majority of employees are EU and the majority of applicants are EU. My mother worked in the NHS as part of the clinical library services used by doctors and frequently commented on the foreign (especially EU) doctors and how many there were. Articles suggest a quarter of our doctors are from the EU. I'm yet to see anyone explain how this would be replaced. \n\nI've read the immigrants tend to be more likely to have qualifications (64% of immigrants vs 26% of British population) and the billions that this saves us as a country. \n\nI've read about how immigration causes the average wage to rise if you're earning more than the average wage (ie. Pay Gap increases) and as a qualified worker currently picking up further qualifications that will allow me the mobility to work anywhere in the world... This is great!\n\nAs a musician, I tour the world. I've just been asked if I could do a week in Germany in September. A weekend in Scandinavia in August. A week in Italy in October. I am paid ludicrously well to do these weeks away. Removing right to travel would make it harder for me to work in these markets. \n\nI am unsure that any argument based around democracy holds weight. The majority of EU legislation is fairly reasonable and on issues that we've brought to them (for instance, the tampon tax) we've been able to have a great effect: the EU is now changing how VAT works. We can work with the EU, and whilst not all of our politicians are electing to do so, I'm optimistic that in the future it will be possible. \n\n**So, in short. There are three major arguments for brexit. Immigration, economy and democracy. All three seem to lack evidence or support from academics and statistics to be suitable for backing \"leave\".**","score":"1","subreddit":"unitedkingdom"}

{"body":"There is the brand new university campus on the hill above the town, built with more than £100m from Brussels. Down at the water’s edge, the EU has helped transform a dilapidated wharf into a funky office space. It has spruced up roads and rail lines. And it has spent £50m to help bring superfast broadband internet service to a remote region where it was scarce.\n\nYet many in Penryn are ready to quit the EU when Britain holds a national referendum next month. It is a state of affairs that even the town’s longtime residents struggle to comprehend.\n\n“It’s absolutely astonishing,” says Caroline Cox, who helps manage the EU-supported Jubilee Wharf development. “It’s this flabbergasting situation where so much money has been put in [by the EU] yet people are turning their backs.”\n\nWith just 530,000 people, Cornwall took in more than €654m from Brussels during the EU’s 2007 to 2013 budget cycle, among the UK’s biggest beneficiaries. It has been earmarked at least €600m more — worth some €1,209 per person — up to 2020. But Cornwall is a reminder that the EU’s money does not necessarily buy love.  \n  \nFive of the region’s six MPs are backing Brexit. Those who support remaining in the EU are panicking at the discovery of “outers” all around them.\n\n“My own wife wants out. I couldn’t believe it. I nearly fell off my chair,” says Peter Moody, a printing company owner who does not believe the risk of leaving outweighs the potential benefits.\n\nMany in Cornwall appear motivated by less-quantifiable factors. The region has traditionally lived from the sea and residents are often furious at EU fishing policies, which they believe have benefited French and Spanish fleets at their expense. Cornwall also shares much of the western world’s palpable dissatisfaction with government and elites — an anger that, in this instance, has fuelled a movement to ban second home purchases by wealthy outsiders. And the campaign has cast a light on passions — fundamentally concerning identity — that are not easily reconciled by development grants or economic projections.  \n  \nTucked away in Britain’s remote south-west corner, with its own heritage and language, Cornwall does not always enthusiastically identify itself as English, still less as European.\n\n“We’re different from the English,” said one woman handing out Vote Leave pamphlets last week, explaining her contempt for the EU. “We’re Celts — no one tells us what to do!”\n\nStill, some locals strongly support the EU, which has provided economic support to a region that has struggled to regain its prosperity since the closure of tin mines in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nBert Biscoe, a poet and musician who is an independent member of Cornwall’s governing council, credits Brussels for nurturing Cornwall’s cultural identity.  \n  \n“It enabled us to see ourselves differently,” he says. He is convinced two recent EU investments in Cornwall — broadband internet and a new university campus — will transform the region by allowing talented young people to build businesses rather than joining an exodus that dates from the tin mines’ collapse. “More young people now want to stay in Cornwall than leave,” he says. “That’s huge!”\n\nBuilt on the site of an old nunnery, Falmouth University’s Penryn campus did not even exist until 2001. The EU has given its 5,000 students their own film and television school, a performing arts facility with state of the art recording studios and much more. Its administrative building — with blonde wooden beams and window shades that adjust automatically throughout the day — looks as if it has been transplanted from Berlin.\n\nA sign outside with the EU flag notes Brussels’ contribution. Similar plaques dot the campus. “They’re very insistent. You must put up the signs,” says Anne Carlisle, the vice-chancellor.  \n  \nThat seems a small nuisance for a campus that may help lift Cornwall from its standing as the UK region with the lowest proportion of higher education students. But to critics, the EU signs signify wasteful spending. A much-publicised 2011 study found that Cornwall — for all the EU funding — had failed to improve its per-capita GDP. Job creation also fell well short of projections. “People said: ‘I told you so!’” said Kim Conchie, chief executive of the Cornwall chamber of commerce.\n\nOne of the outers’ chief arguments — made by former London mayor Boris Johnson when he helped kick off the Leave campaign in Cornwall last week — is that the UK could better invest in its own regions without first cycling the money through Brussels.\n\nMr Conchie and Ms Carlisle are not convinced. “The EU’s been a much better mechanism for getting money from the wealthier parts of Britain to the poorer parts than our own government’s ever been,” Mr Conchie says. “And yet it seems as though there’s a huge amount of Cornish people, perhaps who don’t know the facts of all that money that we’ve had from the EU, who rail against it.”  \n  \nFew in Penryn view such funding as a decisive argument. When David Seabourne, a local fishmonger, approached the EU for help relocating his business a year ago, “there was so much red tape and jumping through hoops I decided it would be easier to do it off my own bat,” he says.\n\nEven when he looks at the EU sign on the disused coal yard that a £600,000 Brussels grant helped turn into an office and residential complex, Mr Seabourne makes clear his discontent: “If that money were kept in the UK, that plaque would just say: ‘British government money.” And when asked how they will vote next month, he and his staff reply without hesitation: “Out!”","score":"3","subreddit":"unitedkingdom"}

If the conservative way of doing things was the right way, buy / bet sterling. If it was wrong, short-sell sterling / bet against sterling. \n\nThe conservatives put a dying nag into the two horse currency race in 1992, just as the Leave campaign did this year. [Soros even warned Britain last week the Leave horse was a nag that would die on the race track.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/brexit-crash-pound-living-standards-george-soros) \n\n\u0026gt;\"To start off, sterling is almost certain to fall steeply and quickly if there is a vote to leave– even more so after yesterday’s rebound as markets reacted to the shift in opinion polls towards remain.

And he made a fortune in the process, purely because of conservative economic folly. So now you all know why the right-wing press in the UK and US hates him with a seething irrational hatred... they fear him because he was 100% correct and they lost their little fluffy dreams (and possibly some of their cash too) based on Conservative sound-bites. And Murdoch slams Soros in his media because he's a sore loser. Soros was spot on then, and he was spot on again now.\n\nDon't complain that some punters made money betting on a race when the owners of the horse that died lost every shred of credibility they had. Don't complain at them, they saw through the horseshit and listened to actual experts. In fact, you'd have been a fool to actively bet on a dying nag.

And they've not done it, which means we should look into the reasons why more carefully.\n\nDoes the NHS want to spend more money *and* get more people to catch HIV?\n\nOr is your picture of the problem incorrect?\n\nWell, it's not a one time cost of £360, for a start, that's the monthly cost. So it's a continuing £4320/year cost for everyone you give it to. Not everyone would get HIV without PrEP either, so you need to look at the reduction in how many cases there would be. Then, you'd want to look at how this compares to anti-retrovirals, the improvement in quality of life, and also what else the money could be spent on. If 100 people take PrEP and it stops one of them getting HIV over their lifetime, that may come at a cost of £17.3M per case (40 years \\* 12 months \\* 100 people \\* £360). You can see how the number scales quite quickly (in both directions) based on how many cases you expect it to prevent. Assuming the cost is greater than anti-retrovirals is the improvement in QoL greater there or somewhere else in the NHS budget, and what are the longer term costs \u0026amp; problems of *not* treating it (spread of infections, increased risks in surgery? etc).\n\nSo, it's a fairly unknown cost, and would probably see best use being highly targeted. Are the NHS being daft here? Well, they're putting £2M to get some sites to try giving it out and see how effective it is (do the highest risk people actually keep taking the drug? etc). That seems pretty sensible. I expect that should happen before committing to an expensive, country wide distribution of PrEP anyway and what's happening now is arguments about who should pay for it. \n\nhttps://www.england.nhs.uk/2016/03/prep/\n\n ","score":"5","subreddit":"unitedkingdom"}

For example, let's say the h2 pawn is under attack, white plays Nf1 to defend which is described as \"artificial\" because there was a more \"natural looking move, Bg3 which is often played in similar positions..\nStrong players have strong feelings about what, in their experience, feels natural and you often find GM commentators agreeing that some move seems artificial or doesn't \"feel\" quite right. Of course, there are times where the \"artificial\" move turns out to have been well considered and superior to the natural looking move and that's when accolades are given and humble pie is eaten.\"","score":"19","subreddit":"chess"}

From time to time Ill analyze things in xboard, but mostly it's just scid for me.\n\nAlso it's important to note that Stockfish is significantly stronger than Fritz, so the reasons to get Fritz should not be related to engine strength. For a common reference rating list for chess engines see [CCRL](http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/).\n\nFinally I'd like to mention that a good reason to invest in an engine is to support the authors, be it donating to the Stockfish team, buying Komodo or supporting one of the weaker engines. People invest a lot of time in these engines and don't really do it for the money, but support like that helps them invest in hardware which helps test different things. The top engines have quite different playstyles, so a lot also has to do with taste and I can recommend giving all the free engines a try.","score":"2","subreddit":"chess"}

{"body":"Don't think any other country in the world will ever understand our rivalry with England. Obviously, they produce better players than we do most of the time. There's 60 million of them and they all play football. I guess being neighbours means a rivalry is inevitable. But this one is different. They don't care about us, 99% of the time, which is fair enough because normally we don't pose much of a threat. But that's not the same for us. We are bombarded by the England football team. We can't watch international football tournaments that we don't qualify for from a neutral perspective - we can only access these matches via the English media. England flags are flown across Wales, memorabilia is everywhere to be seen, and their fans always look at our best individual players and say \"I bet they regret not playing for us!\" or \"we should join together! Play as one team! Obviously we'll keep our anthem, and culture, and stadium!\". And even now, when we have qualified for a major tournaments, you see shops selling English versions of memorabilia with no Welsh equivalents to be seen. At half-time in all of our matches so far, the English panelists, with a token Welshman on there, have moved the discussion to England. The build-up to Wales' participation in this tournament has actually brilliant, and I've really enjoyed it, but it's absolutely been tainted by having to watch a lot of it from an English perspective. \n\nSo, despite all that, we have actually done better than they have. Despite our nation being so much smaller, getting so much less attention and having nowhere near the same amount of resources, Wales have proven themselves to be among the top 8 teams in Europe. We have taken our rare opportunity and the players and staff have given the fans one of the best summers they will ever remember. I am so happy that Welsh football is so positive right now. Yeah, we might be rubbish a lot of the time and might even go back to being bad after the current crop retire. But we know that when we do qualify, we make the best of it. While English football is so negative and high-pressure, we know we can trust our players to give their all and do what they can. That's all a small nation like us can ask for. But we know that when we do, we can compete with England. We can compete with anybody. Cymru am Byth!","score":"74","subreddit":"Wales"}

{"body":"I can't speak to NZ in particular, but there are (at least) two possible reasons an autisitic person might have a case for reinstatement (getting their job back) in many countries:\n   \n  1.  The employer knew OP was autistic and didn't want to employ an autistic person.  This is discrimination and it only happens when employer is aware that the person is in the protected class (in this case, a person with a disability).  It *doesn't* sound like this is what happened here because, as OP said, employer didn't know op is autistic.\n  2.  The employer failed to make 'reasonable accommodations' for the person with a disability.  Under US (and probably NZ) law, if a disabled person is capable of performing the core job functions with 'reasonable accommodations' an employer needs to make those accommodations.  So, if a person in a wheelchair is qualified for a job in accounting, but can't perform their job because accounting is on the 5th floor of a building with no elevator, the employer needs to figure out how to get that person up to the 5th floor.  They can't say, \"this just isn't working out.\"  However, if that person in the wheelchair applied for a job in a race car pit crew, the employer can nope out by saying they are unable to perform the core functionality of the job at a high enough level.\n\nIn OP's case, OP \"wasn't working out\" because of something *directly* related to OP's disability, but perhaps (we don't have details about this) *unrelated* to the job's core function.  In this case the employer in many countries has the burden of attempting to accommodate the disabled employee.

We also did a cake tasting and ordered our wedding cake while we were down as well as went dress shopping so my mom, FMIL, and sister could attend. Our family and friends have been very willing to help with anything we need. The biggest issue we have faced is half of our decorations are down in IL and half are up here.

{"body":"Here's my list. I initially had a few three-peaters but then I decided to scrape aside from 1. I'm not referring to the spoiled cast list of S34 but I do know a few of them. So basically, all except 1 has only played once. I try to cast them from a producer's point of view and how I think they might interact with each other.\n\nHeroes\n1) Mike Holloway - I wanted 2 winners on each tribe just like the original. I thought Mike could be an interesting winner to be back and seeing how he would do with some actual strategy this time.\n\n2) Terry Deitz - The only 3-time player. Since he didn't get to play properly in Cambodia, this would be a good opportunity to have him again.\n\n3) Tai Trang - Another older guy, would be interesting to see how he mix with a bigger group and with people more to his age.\n\n4) Hayden Moss - He was a good strategist, just on the wrong side of the numbers his previous time.\n\n5) Jaison Robinson - Samoa was just focused too much on Russell. Need another male player to come back. Wasn't initially in my list but I thought given a 2nd chance, how would he managed to work with people?\n\n6) Denise Stapley - Another strong winner. She definitely fought her way to the finals and she might just scrape through again another time.\n\n7) Teresa Cooper - T-Bird was robbed of a chance in Cambodia and definitely would love to see her back trying her best to play the game.\n\n8) Aubry Bracco - I wasn't sure to put her where but I thought this might suit her better. Would be interested to see how she and Tai being on a tribe again would be. And how she would work others on a strategic level.\n\n9) Michelle Yi - I think her story is still unfinished and she fits the token Asian slot.\n\n10) Holly Hoffman - Holly was an interesting character in Nicaragua and hopefully a 2nd version let her start strong instead of her stumbling start previously.\n\n\nVillains\n\n1) Tony Vlachos - He is definitely the most interesting person I want to play again. I doubt he can win again but just wondering how he would be in a Villains tribe.\n\n2) Brad Culpepper - He was in and out of my cast list but I just thought that we do need some fodder in the cast and he did make an impression his first time. He might try to improve his 2nd time although try could be the word. Lol.\n\n3) Dreamz Herd - I really want to see Dreamz play again, just to see how he performs with people knowing bout that car deal. And whether he will still be that same guy we saw in Fiji.\n\n4) Shane Powers - I know he said he has not wanted to come back but maybe with a done deal, he might. Whatever it is, I still want to see Shane and his antics in a Survivor season again.\n\n5) Dan Foley - I want to see his reaction being on a Villains tribe and we always need some characters like him to laugh at. But who knows, he could be more aware the 2nd time around.\n\n6) Natalie Anderson - She's a great character and I will love to see how she and Tony reacts to one another.\n\n7) Cydney Gillon - She was another one I wasn't sure to put where but I didn't want to put 2 females from a season together so I decided to put her here. Her sassiness and strategic thinking was nice to watch and maybe she could do it a 2nd time.\n\n8) Twila Tanner - Another amazing character and had some strategy her previous time. \n\n9) Carolyn Rivera - Mama C deserves another season. Another great female older player.\n\n10) Alicia Rosa - She and Colton were definitely the villains of One World. Would be a good character on the show but might be fodder for the rest.","score":"1","subreddit":"survivor"}

{"body":"\u0026gt;There just aren’t as many colorful women characters in Survivor history, and we’ve used up the ones we can.  For whatever reason we’re loaded with interesting guys.\n\nActual Jeff Probst quote\n\nJeff openly and blatantly tends to prefer male contestants to female contestants and is very clear in his adoration of dominant men.  It's not very hard to tell even from just watching episodes at this point.  \"Raging\" implies a degree of explicitness that I don't think applies to Jeff, but it's really really obvious that he favors men on average.  \n\nAlso, it's an undeniable reality just from the numbers that men get substantially more screentime and credit than women do in the show's editing and production unless it's literally unavoidable like in One World.  Jeff, as an executive producer PLUS all the weight he can bring to bear as the face of the show and someone whom the show arguably could not survive without, has some measure of control of this.  He might not be directly enacting the airtime disparity (though he might be, by telling production who the \"important people\" are), but at best he's doing nothing to stop it.\n\nEven if you take everything completely at face value and assume that Survivor really does cast way more interesting men than women (which seems very unlikely to me, especially given how underedited some obviously interesting women have been, the editing of all-star / FvF type seasons where we already know who's interesting and who isn't, etc.), then there's a problem with the way *casting* treats women that hasn't been addressed, and Jeff is a major part of the casting process and is an executive producer / host / etc. etc.  And I *would* say there are some problems with the way casting treats women that are also pretty obvious--I don't think it's a coincidence, just for example, that the Beauty men have had some guys over 30, two gay men who weren't white and may not have fit traditional archetypes of physical attractiveness, etc. and the Beauty women have been six straight white women who capped out at age 26.\n\nUnless, of course, you just think men are inherently more interesting or complex than women, in which case I would go ahead and point the sexist finger at you.  :P","score":"22","subreddit":"survivor"}

The edit of every *Survivor* winner is tied into the overall storyline of a season; therefore, no winners have identical edits, because the respective storylines and circumstances of their seasons are different. (I do think there's a difference between a winner's storyline that makes sense, and a storyline that is satisfying...but that's a different discussion, lol)\n\nI also want to touch upon Edgic for a bit (I'm no Edgic master, but these are just my thoughts). In my opinion, because there is no single “winner's edit,” because all winners are edited differently, and because Molly refers to the edit as not being numeric or formulaic, the use of Edgic technically isn't a blatant spoiler because there is no specific “winner's edit” code that it is trying to crack. However, I do agree that Edgic can be very spoiler-ish because I think it is an effective tool in figuring out which players have edits that are being developed into ones in which a victory would make sense in the end, as I mentioned above (and, vice-verse, which ones don't).

First the fact that Rose thinks he can win a copyright battle that is either against or involves Google in some way is a tall task, but the fact that he's going through with it means he's obviously INCREDIBLY bothered by the memes, which is hilarious, and really head-scratching. He's not interested in changing people's perception of him as an asinine fool who kicks his bandmates in the balls when they question him, but those pictures of him being fat, those have got to go.\n\nlol\n\nAnd anyway, he's lost almost all of that weight and he's back to being slim again, but he still can't put that part of his life behind him? He put all of the blown off concerts out of his mind, why is this what gets to him?\n\nBut the most hilarious thing by far is that Rose forgot how the internet works. I've counted at least 20 different sites, including TIME, covering this story, and that's bringing even more attention to the memes. I had never seen this meme before and I've spent the last hour accomplishing nothing but giggling to myself looking at these. \n\nI swear Axl Rose is here on earth for the sole purpose of being a endless source of amusement for me.

Think he'd be great with a PnR PG (Russell, Clarkson, and even Huertas if he returns).\n\nWith below-average defenders (mostly Russell, Clarkson, and Randle - not saying they can't improve with time), you need to add more defensive pieces. Even Ingram was pretty good defensively, albeit in college.","score":"-1","subreddit":"lakers"}

{"body":"I think it really comes down to the issue of audience. I think the main problem Trent faces as an artist is that he wants to do projects with more restraint like you described, but he built his fanbase on his earlier projects that feature a much more aggressive and violent sound that you can't really find anywhere else. Now his image as a musician is very much coloured as loud, explicit, sexual, violent, and unrestrained. Try recommending Ghosts I-IV to someone who loves modern minimalism or ambient music and they'll immediately be wary when you say \"Nine Inch Nails.\"\n\nI'd be willing to guess that at least half of NIN fans come for the songwriting/energy/emotion, with overall artistry and concept being a secondary concern. Which is entirely fine – people are free to enjoy what they enjoy for whatever reasons they have. But Trent is alienating a sizable fraction of his following when he does projects like HM, devoid of everything they most want out of a Nine Inch Nails record. On the other hand, how many new fans is Trent going to attract with his new sound? NIN is almost three decades old, and has a permanent reputation in pop culture history that will dissuade the kind of person who might enjoy a record like HM from ever giving it a chance.\n\nAll things considered, it makes a ton of sense why Trent has toyed with the idea of burying the NIN project for good. He just isn't interested in making the kind of music NIN is known for, NIN fans aren't interested in the music he wants to make, and the kind of person who would enjoy the music he wants to make is turned of by the NIN reputation. On the one hand, I really respect his bravery and artistic integrity for releasing something like HM as an NIN project – making what he wants despite knowing all of this. On the other hand, I really hope he moves on and focuses on new things like soundtracking. Hell, he could even keep on doing what he's doing, just under a different name.

Two, my goals and mindset are different than before, my determination is much more serious, and I'm finding it easier to find motivation to just get it done.  Three, instead of jumping straight into a huge lifestyle change I'm taking it by degrees with my diet.  That's a big one for me because it feels more sustainable, and I don't stress about not being able to eat this or that (allowing me to work into a healthier view of food).  A lot goes into it but I think I've been much more serious about it this time around and have a much healthier outlook, which is what has made it a lot more effective in combating my depression.

It's not plug \u0026amp; play, so used that way it'll be no better than just buying an espro press straight.  \n\nBut if you have someone (a staff member, for instance) responsible for meticulously iterating and dialing-in each coffee, you can create highly detailed and very impeccably tuned brew profiles for each coffee that colleagues *can* just plug and play.  They put the grounds in the top, use your profile, and it comes out as good as you dialed for the first time.  \n\nSo \"why was it so good\" is a combination of the machine being capable of that amount of tuning and detail, and someone on staff who cared enough to make sure it actually had great results.  It's not uncommon to get decisively average coffee off one of these style of device, because the cafe is unwilling or doesn't know to allocate substantial resources to taking advantage of their showy machines' brewing capabilities.

Whether you think they are or not, or should be or not, they are serious cyclists who have tremendous more knowledge, experience, and training than you. I find it extremely insensitive and ignorant of you to think that they are the asshole, when in reality you are the asshole. You are hindering their training rides, because that is what they are. What else is there besides A rides for amateurs? Individual riding, and that isn't the same. So unless you want to race and actually compete, you need to step down and stay at the B level, and use your own individual rides as your training. ","score":"-9","subreddit":"bicycling"}

{"body":"You leave him out of this, its just between us.\nIn rereading my original post, I think I came across as more upset about it than I actually was.  My only reason for posting about it was because I was curious what other peoples experiences were in going through a drive through on a bicycle.  I guess whether this was industry standard or just a policy of some fast food companies.","score":"0","subreddit":"bicycling"}
{"body":"In London, I find mostly the black cab drivers are decent towards cyclists. I find the Uber drivers, minicab drivers and \"chaffeurs\" are the ones who are dicks. Prius' who just turn whenever they want without indicating. minicab drivers who open doors without looking. Actual cabbies are great I've found. Give me lots of room, let me cut through small gaps. I find guys in black mercedes (as cabs) tend to try and close the gaps between cars when it looks like I might want to go through it.","score":"53","subreddit":"bicycling"}
