Es soll dem Leser so sympathisch sein.\n\n* Der Protagonist beschreibt, wie peinlich ihm das alles ist und das es ihm eigentlich gar nicht um das Geld geht. Wir Leser sollen Mitgefühl für ihn haben.\n\n* Der Protagonist wendet sich an einen Polizisten oder Wachmann, der dann sagt: \"Das Problem ist uns bekannt, aber da kann man leider nichts machen.\"\n\nKeiner ist so dumm und glaubt die Geschichte, dass jemand 14 € zum Studieren in der Schweiz braucht. Noch nicht mal Herr Martenstein. Und wenn er es dann doch glaubt und er die 10 € gibt, warum will er es dann wieder zurück haben, nur weil die Frau nicht dankbar genug war. Jemand der treudoof jemanden 10 € gibt wird diese nicht zurückverlangen.\n\nAußerdem wäre die Bande mit den 10 € von einer Person mehr als zufrieden. Das letzte, was so eine Bande will, ist auffallen. Die fangen keinen Streit wegen 10 oder 4 € an. Die nehmen mehrere tausend Euro im Monat ein, völlig legal übrigens, denn Betteln ist grundsätzlich erstmal erlaubt in Deutschland. Die machen sich ihr legales Geschäft nicht kaputt dadurch, dass sie jemand an einem Bahnhof zusammenschlagen wegen 10 €.\n\nUnd das beste ist sowieso das Maymay, dass der Polizist dann sagt: \"Du wurdest gerade ausgeraubt, aber da können wir nichts machen.\" So verhält sich kein Polizist oder Wachmann. Du könntest zu einem Polizist sagen \"Da hat mich einer angerempelt.\" und in 99% der Fällen würde der Polizist zumindest so tun, als würde er das ernst nehmen.

Diese Verschweißung muss ordnungsgemäß ausgeführt sein.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; b) Der Lauf muss auf seiner gesamten Länge (im Patronenlager beginnend) mit einem Längsschlitz von mindestens 4mm Breite versehen sein, oder aber im Abstand von jeweils 3cm jeweils kalibergroße Bohrungen tragen. Es müssen MINDESTENS 3 Bohrungen vorhanden sein, auch wenn der Lauf kürzer wäre. Ist er eben länger als 9cm, müssen eben mehr Bohrungen angebracht sein. Anderweitige Laufveränderungen sind nur nach Absprache mit der zuständigen Stelle (jetzt Beschussamt) zulässig und müssen im Endeffekt den gleichen Öffnungsgrad am Laufmaterial ergeben, wie bei den beiden vorgenannten Varianten.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; c) Der Verschluss muss dauerhaft funktionsunfähig sein. Das heißt, der Verschlussboden (Stossfläche) muss um mindestens 45Grad abgeschliffen sein, die Schlagbolzenaustrittsfläche muss zusätzlich verschweißt sein, oder aber die Schlagbolzenführung muss durch Schweißstellen blockiert sein, bzw. komplett ausgefräst sein..\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; d) In Griffstücken von Kurzwaffen muss der Auslösemechanismus DAUERHAFT FUNKTIONSUNFÄHIG sein. Das bedeutet zum Beispiel entweder Ausbohren der Hahnachsenführung, Verschweißen des Hammers in Endstellung oder Einschweißen eines Vierkantes anstelle des Hammers; ist eine Hahnachsenführung nicht vorhanden oder kein Hammer (z.B. innenliegende Schlagbolzenschloße ), muss der Abzugsmechanismus (Abzugszüngel, Abzug, Gestänge) durch gleichartig wirkende Schweißungen blockiert werden.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Zu bedenken ist hierbei, dass diese Arbeiten nur von einem zugelassenen Herstellungsbetrieb oder Büchsenmacher mit Herstellungslizenz abgeändert werden dürfen.\n\n\n\u0026gt; Langwaffen DEKO: (alle Waffen - außer Kriegswaffen - , deren bestimmungsgemäße Gesamtlänge länger als 60cm ist und Lauf/Verschlusseinheit größer 30cm ist)\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Bei Langwaffen über 60cm Gesamtlänge müssen folgende Änderungen erfüllt sein, bevor sie NICHT mehr dem WaffG unterfallen:\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; a) das Patronenlager muss (wie auch bei den Pistolen oben beschrieben) dauerhaft unbrauchbar gemacht sein\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; b) der Verschluss muss dauerhaft unbrauchbar gemacht sein ( Stossboden muss um exakt 45Grad –oder mehr-abgeschliffen sein, d.h. ein an der unteren Kante angesetzter Winkel muss diesen Wert zeigen!!) Das Schlagbolzenaustrittsloch muss verschlossen (Verschweißt/ verstiftet) sein, damit ein Zünden einer Patrone auch nicht durch einen evtl. hervortretenden Schlagbolzen möglich wäre.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; c) Der Lauf muss vor dem Patronenlager (genau in dem dem Patronenlager zugewandten Drittel des Laufes) 6 kalibergroße Bohrungen, oder andere gleichwertige Laufveränderungen: z.B. Schlitzungen von ebensolcher Breite o.ä. aufweisen UND VOR diesen Veränderungen in Richtung zur Laufmündung zeigend, mit einem kalibergroßen GEHÄRTETEN Stahlstift DAUERHAFT verschlossen sein. (das heißt, dieser Stahlstift ist gegen Ausbauen zu sichern, z.B. durch Schweißungen o.ä.)\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; d) Auch hier gilt bezüglich der Aufbringung der Zulassungszeichen, das unter Kurzwaffen gesagte...d.h., Einzelstücke sind immer in Natura einem Beschussamt zur Prüfung vorzulegen. Bei Massenabänderungen genügt die Vorlage eines Musterstückes –das beim Amt verbleibt-, auf deren baugleichen „Nachfolgestücken“ dann immer das zugeteilte Zulassungszeichen vom Veränderer aufzubringen ist.

This is not a good primary source but is consistent with other information I have heard. Health care cost per person in Canada is lower by roughly 50% compared to the USA - so 60% of the savings are due to eliminating the need for the insurance company / billing, with the balance due to lower physician salaries and limits on resources (MRI scans, hip replacements) set on the system.\nA little further down someone linked in an analysis of administrative costs in Hospitals in the USA and Canada where administrative costs in the USA were roughly 25% of expenditures while 12% or so in Canada.

This measure can be found by drawing a circle of arbitrary radius (centered at the point at which the rays meet), measuring the arc length of the circle between the intersections, and dividing said arc length by the radius of the circle.\n\nAngles can also be measured by \"degree-measure\" rather than standard measure (often referred to as \"measure in radians\"). If so, the measure is succeeded by the degree symbol ° and multiplied by a factor of 360/(2π).\n\nSine and cosine are a function from a real number θ (interpreted as the measure of an angle) to a real number in the interval [-1,1]. There are several different, equivalent definitions:\n\n - `[; \\sin\\theta = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n \\frac{\\theta^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} ;]` and `[; \\cos\\theta = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n \\frac{\\theta^{2n}}{(2n)!} ;]`\n\n - Make an angle with one ray being the vector [;\\langle 1,0\\rangle;] and the other angle being a unit vector. If the measure of the angle between the vectors is θ (measuring counterclockwise from the given vector), the other vector is [;\\langle\\sin\\theta,\\cos\\theta\\rangle;].\n\n - sin(θ) is the solution to the differential equation f''(θ) = -θ with initial conditions f'(0)=1, f(0)=0. cos(θ) is the solution to the same differential equation with initial conditions f(0)=1, f'(0)=0.\n\nIf θ∈(0,π/2), sine and cosine can be interpreted another way:\n\n - In a right triangle with one angle A of measure θ, sin(θ) is the ratio of the lengths of the leg opposite angle A and the hypotenuse. cos(θ) is the ratio of the lengths of the leg adjacent to angle A and the hypotenuse.","score":"3","subreddit":"math"}

{"body":"I feel obligated to point out that complex numbers are certainly sufficient for dealing with our current models of quantum physics (e.g. representing probabilities other than 50%).  But the essence of your question \"Can we extend maths to help model our physical reality?\" is worth answering.\n\nOthers have pointed to quaternions (and octonions and sedenions) as the \"next level\" that you are probably looking for [in terms of generalizing complex numbers] but it is worth noting that as you \"move up\" to these higher notions you start to lose properties and arguably move away from what a \"number\" really is.  For example, when you move to complex numbers, while you gain the ability to solve algebraic equations (like x^2 + 1 = 0), you lose the ability to say if one number is greater than another.  When you move up to the \"next level\" of quaternions, you lose the property that a×b = b×a for all a and b.  Now in some cases this is not terrible, for instance rotations in 3D space are not commutative and sure enough, quaternions are very useful for describing 3D rotations.  With octonions you lose the property that a×(b×c) = (a×b)×c and from a mathematical perspective things are starting to get quite ugly.\n\nThese tools have been around for decades, but they haven't (yet/really) been used to expand our models of reality.  Instead,\nrather than building [practical] mathematics by expanding on what a \"number\" is, mathematicians have found it more productive to forget numbers altogether and just focus on the operations.  For example a group is a set of objects with \"multiplication\", \"inverses\" and an \"identity\" (i.e. an element with the same property that 1 has with respect to multiplication in the integers).  It turns out many physical phenomena, especially those associated with symmetry, can be neatly modelled with groups - e.g. rotations in n-dimensional space.  In fact, symmetry is such a key part of our current understanding of reality that groups form the basis of our current model of the universe.\n\n**TL;DR** If you want to use maths to understand our reality better, rather than going to the \"next level\" of imaginary number, consider instead the algebraic operations as what needs to be generalized - i.e. go to the \"next level\" of multiplication.","score":"9","subreddit":"math"}

There is no state of neither believing nor not believing in something.\n\n\u0026gt;And when you say \"there is no god\", You are accepting truth without evidence. \n\nIt's impossible to prove there is no god due to a logical concept known as the devil's proof.  To prove the existence of a devil, all one has to do is appear.  But the fact that a devil doesn't appear does not disprove their existence.  That means that \"there is no god\" is technically a theory, one that calls on theists to disprove.

{"body":"Yes the system is at fault, which is ok, because a system should always be evolving. There will always be loopholes which criminals will exploit and we need to plug these holes while ensuring that innocents don't get trapped. If you will make a rape \"accusation\" a non bailable offence then it will become another loophole to take out your opponents. \n\nThe first thing that needs to be done is to ensure that the police does its job well. That also means we must treat them well and make them sensitive and accountable. The force is in need for some serious reform and no political party wants to implement it because it serves them well if they are easily corruptible. Secondly, all cases need to be concluded within a short time frame in a fair manner. This alone will drive the fear of the law in most of sick fucks thinking about raping. Right now getting away is easy so the incidents aren't going to come down very soon. \n\nThere are other factors involved that need a societal change. There is a stigma attached that's not going away anytime soon. This alone stops many girls from lodging police complaints. Then there could be caste and class equations which make it hard for someone to pursue justice. \n\nBut beneath all this you must understand what is changing fundamentally. More and more women are getting out today than ever before. They are going to study, to work and contributing to their families and society. These incidents are the result of the friction being created because of the changing power dynamics. But will this stop the women from coming out? No. Because independence is worth the risk. Sooner than later they will organize and bring about the revolution for themselves. It just has to get worse before it gets better.","score":"3","subreddit":"india"}

The way she would be moved depends on how far she is from the attack and the angle of the Parry (block).\n\n\u0026gt;My point is that, even though its a fast attack that covers a pretty big area, its not like its an atomic slicer. Fighting straight up, nigh-impossible to avoid. But just thinking about it, it doesn't make sense for there to be nothing to do to mitigate the attack. Hell you could even crouch and let horizontal strikes go over your head and parry/block the vertical attack.\nI don't see the narration as be-all end-all.\n\nAll of this was addressed in the VN, though.\n\n    A circular slash and a vertical slash. …And probably a horizontal slash that cuts anyone that escapes sideways.\n    There is nowhere to run if the three attacks are executed all at once.\n    Once in range, the other two attacks will cut you even if one is blocked.\n    One cannot escape sideways, and the longsword will reach out even if one retreats.\n\n    The longsword trembles.\n    His body moves in with one step.\n    The distance to attack Saber.\n    Prison-like arcs are executed from a range that does not allow any defense!\n\n1.

The attack is so much faster than her, judging by the comment that the longsword will still reach even if she retreated which doesn't necessarily mean backwards. If it wasn't that much faster, she'd have evaded or maybe even blocked one maybe even two of the three slashes. She clearly couldn't do even a fraction of that.\n\n3. The attack doesn't just cover a pretty big area, it covers EVERY area. The guy literally breaks reality to deliver his slashes.\n\nThere's nothing really to discuss here.

I didn't like that trait at first. In every episode discussion thread, people have been saying that the deaths should start affecting him, and they didn't. And then at one point, it kicked in, almost as if the writer thought: \"Oh yes, I forgot that he might get fucked up from dying, let me add that!\" I think it would have been more believable if it happened gradually, but we didn't see gradual change. So while I do agree that his behavior is consistent, it might be too consistent to be believable.\n\nThen again, it took him a few deaths to even figure out what happened, and since ep 1 he's always rushed into danger head first without thinking, so we already established that he was a retard. So maybe this behavior isn't that unbelievable. Fuck, I'm so torn on this.\n\nAnd on the whole 'projecting' thing: I could never mentally project myself onto a character.

However, some action is better than nothing, which is why Nagase could use some outside help.\n\nYou do make a point about them being teenagers, though.

{"body":"\u0026gt; If you like character situations to have a crescendo thats understandable I guess, but for me I prefer things to flow more naturally, stories feel more interesting when they have an element of the unexpected and aren't completely predictable.\n\nI would say unpredictability can often feel more unnatural, especially within a narrative where we are introduced to characters we don't know. Narratives should behave differently to real life because we can't enforce the same level of attachment to the events, as we don't have a hand in creating them.\n\n\u0026gt; I don't disagree; if your argument was built around that point I would agree completely. But if its about how the mom's aren't super caring I disagree that its a flaw.\n\nMaybe if one of the moms took a different stance it would feel more natural, but the fact both moms have the same opinion creates an issue of being written to an agenda as opposed to being written as a character.\n\nThis is done in other shows but doubling down on it really brings attention to it.\n\n\u0026gt; So far its pretty clear that the plot isn't going to be about baseball(at least not completely) and more about the development of the characters. If the plot is about an unlikeable kid learning more about life, isn't it okay?\n\nYes that's fine but it doesn't feel like that's been established yet, it feels like the show is building as house and forget to create the foundations. Another point is character conflict shouldn't be black and white, there should be grey areas but as we only see the main characters side of events and the mother only appears to spark conflict we have a black and white situation... the moms are dicks. There are many events that could of been cut out to really flesh out the root of these conflicts, but everything is being established at once so we get multiple issues appearing from many different angles.\n\n","score":"2","subreddit":"anime"}
{"body":"I guess I did a bad job getting my point across. A lot of Subaru's actions do (in character's perception at time of action) work towards his goals but the tone is just not there to support it. \"Tyrion killed his father because he was an obstacle to his rise in the far future\" \"But why now? In the castle? With no planning at clearly suboptimal time and place?\" \"Because.\". \n\nThis isn't setup for anything. You are not going \"Why did he do it\"; they set it up like it should be self explanatory. But they've completely dropped the ball on emotions. Subaru frequently acts rashly and the emotional tone doesn't explain why, but if you read through the plot and try very hard to go out of your way to add back in the emotional tone it makes sense.

{"body":"Hey everyone! What video games have you been playing and what do you think of them? With the recent announcement of the mini-NES, I thought it would be fun to ask everyone what NES memories they have? \n\nRIP my time to play games. Working 6 days a week ruins any sense of free time, but at least I can still play a few things. \n\nI continued my journey through **Fire Emblem: Conquest** and I'm pretty happy about my team now despite having to reset once. The only downside is Mozu got destroyed when it came to her strength gains, as she's only gotten 1 point of strength in 8 level ups. I may have to opt to abandon her for better units soon, since she's already hit S level support with Arthur, and won't serve much further use if she doesn't get constant strength points in the next few level ups. However, Silas, Felicia, Niles, Effie, and even Odin have some really solid stats right now, so I've got some good troops to fall back on. I'm on chapter 10 right now, which is probably one of the hardest chapters that I've experienced. Everything needs to go perfectly or else I'm screwed. \n\nI've also been playing **Overwatch** in an attempt to get my competitive rank. I've won 6 games and lost 2, and play with ranks around the late 50s/early 60s. The only thing that's really bothered me is Roadhog. No matter what, he always finds a way to show up on the enemy team, and his bullshit hooks get me killed every game. I still manage to almost always get golds for eliminations and damage though, so I think I'm doing a solid job even if I keep getting hard countered. \n\nI remember playing my old NES that belonged to my dad. He had the Duck Hunt/Super Mario Bros cartridge, but I couldn't find the gun, so I mostly played Super Mario Bros. That game was pretty hard for me as a kid. I don't think I ever had the patience to fully beat the game, since I would quit playing after like 30 minutes of trying.

Shoulder injuries aren't all that uncommon either, I had a friend tear their rotator cuff and require surgery, as a result of dusting a shelf, and we're both mid 20s, it happens.  When you're not as active, injuries can happen in the strangest way.\n\nAs some who is actually in their mid-late 20s and finished with university, the MC was actually very relatable.  I can see how younger audiences may not appreciate it or find it exaggerated, but its actually not that far fetched.","score":"10","subreddit":"anime"}

I'm glad you found both the writeup and photos on my site interesting!\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n* I do miss having a viewfinder in two scenarios - (1) Shooting in bright light and (2) Determining critical focus. For (1) I've learnt to guesstimate my framing after awhile and for (2) I set up the focusing system to \"Pinpoint AF\" which really locks in the areas I wish to be in focus. AF works well up to ISO1600, afterwhich the noise creeps in and makes the images kinda soft anyway. \n\n* The 28mm doesn't make for flattering portraits - but I would never use this camera for proper, formal, headshots anyway! A 50 will be too tight, and the 35 always seems to be an in-between compromise to me. I think the touch of distortion of the 28mm gives it a certain flavour, especially in the context of \"in-the-field\" documentary shots. What it DOES excel in is to give a sense of environment to your subjects, which is one reason why I love using the GR for documentary work. \n\n \nYou know what, I shifted the photos around and did some re-editing and now the two pictures that you've linked to are no longer being referenced on my site.

{"body":"There are no smart bulbs on the market appropriate for use in studios as a photo/video lighting source in terms of content creation. It's an issue of power output, or really adjustable white balance. \n\nWe'll be using strobe lighting setups or dedicated video lighting so that's just never going to be your market. There already tons of LED lighting solutions that meet our specific needs in terms of video production (and none for photo because we simply need more power output than what LEDs are capable of). \n\nWhere you CAN come into play will be things like office lighting for workspaces as part of a color critical workflow (such as photo retouching or video color grading). \n\nIn most cases, a video editing suite is a completely dark room so... You can mostly ignore that segment. \n\nFor photo retouching, the IDEAL scenario is low/no light, completely grey walls, and the person in front of the computer is also wearing a grey shirt (all of those things reflect into your display and plays tricks on your eyes if they aren't perfectly neutral. \n\nNow, that's an ideal scenario - not everyone is working under those conditions of course. \n\nMy retouching workspace is most of the way there. \n\nI won't work in complete darkness because it's just too much eye strain for me - but the light I do have are the Osram tunable white bulbs across the board and they work really well for my purposes because during my office hours everything will be at 5600k, and in the evening I'll push it closer to 3000k\n\nMy office is also my living room so it's nice to be able to switch back and forth since the warmer color temp is better for your brain in terms of relaxation when reading a book or watching a movie. \n\nIn dedicated photo studios, there isn't a super huge unmet need because smart bulbs are just more expensive than necessary since I can already buy daylight balanced bulbs and they don't need to be smart. That doesn't mean there's no interest, but you're really looking at the kind of client that is interested in automation because the bulbs already do what I want them to do. \n\nFor people who don't maintain a decimated space (like me) there's an opportunity. \n\nI control my lighting using a Wink Hub, so my complaints are all related to wink and not the bulbs. \n\nThe main thing I wish was easier is to set a specific color temperature instead of using a dumb slider bar that lets me get close but not exact. You hear me wink?' Let me just type in the damned color temperature I want!! Ha. \n\nThe only other thing I do wish the a19 tunable white bulbs I have could be dialed up to be about twice as bright as they are and still fit into a standard light socket/fixture - power save settings be damned.

There are quite a number of subreddits with critique focuses, but there are also dedicated websites which act as writing groups. In-person groups also exist and you can mix and match to get the best experience.\n\nIn-person groups are good. I am not convinced a creative writing degree is essential. Publishers look for the best/most marketable books rather than letters after your name, and readers of self-published books don't ask to see your cv before they buy. The big deal is whether you can sustain a story which entertains, engages, informs or illumines, or any mixture of those. Learning that is fairly easy outside of an academic environment.\n\nMaking a living is hard, and may not happen immediately, and that depends on writing successfully for an audience. It may involve diversifying income streams. However, there are definitely people who do it, either self-publishing or trade publishing. There is no one right answer, but doing some research, keeping an open mind and being well-informed is necessary. I self-published originally, but to be honest, I'm not the sort of person able to hustle and knowing what goes on behind the publishing scenes has helped inform my choices.

No surprise there.\n\n\u0026gt;Having more men willing to kill women for shaming the family vs killing apostates in general makes sense for several reasons, the first two that come to mind are male apostates would be more likely to fight back and female apostates would probably get lumped with honor killings which would also skew the numbers in the direction you are mentioning. Unfortunately we can't ask the dead, \"were you killed for being a slut or for leaving Islam?\" and the symptoms are the same.\n\nIf you say so. I'm not Muslim, let alone a Muslim who accepts honor killings. At *worst*, with unsupported assumptions, the questions are still \"Do you support killing women for honor crimes,\" and \"Do you support killing *anyone* for crimes against the honor of all Muslims\". As such, it is still counter-intuitive.\n\nIn context of the discussion, it's irrelevant. Gender is not addressed in either question, so there is no reason to assume that killing apostates is not equally sexist. That doesn't give me the right to question the rationality of those answering a poll, but it certainly provides (yet more) basis on which to question whether the made-up numbers from a non-existent poll might be biased.\n\nAlso, this was just one example of counter-intuitive numbers. More young *Western* Muslims support killing both apostates and Muslims with suicide bombs, than Muslims support killing only apostates using any method. Nearly twice as many support killing people for infidelity, an \"honor crime\", than do support killing for honor crimes. If the non-existent poll accurately captured people's results, then that completely undermines the original point, which was essentially that Islam is evil. The results actually support my position, which is that there is no one single Islam, since (according to this fictitious poll) many Muslims have no fucking clue what they think.\n\nYou're trying to nit-pick about how one made-up number from a fictitious poll might somehow be related to reality. It's not merely a disingenuous argument, it's a disingenuous argument about a number that is only relevant to a faulty conclusion.

{"body":"This is absolutely true for *religion*, but we seem to be born with the foundations on which it rests - we naturally, and more so as very young children, attribute order or complexity to agents with purposes. In fact, young children, far more than their parents (typically), think teleologically - *everything* exists or happens for a reason.\n\nSo, it actually *is* very much like learning a language. There is a debate about this in another sub-thread, but both sides are making mistakes. The manner in which we learn religion and language is the same, but what is being learned is very different. The fact that religions tout themselves as being the 'one true religion', inconsistent with all others, has nothing to do with *how* we learn them (socially), but is a matter of *what* is learned.\n\nIndeed, our children are born ready to learn any language, or an assortment of them. However, the brain of the child is performing statistical analysis of the phonemes he/she hears, and *not* hearing certain ones makes them insensitive to those sounds - the brain actually ignores what it hasn't heard by age seven. Thus, speakers of Asian languages have difficulty distinguishing 'l' from 'r'. If one only learns his/her native tongue, languages acquired later in life will not be spoken like native speakers of that language. I learned German, and could communicate fine, but it was obvious to any German that I was an American, simply by my enunciation.\n\nOur children are also born ready to receive any religion. It's no accident that religions have target receptors as mentioned in the first paragraph. It's also no accident that most religions prey on our most salient fear - death. As with language, if we aren't exposed to a religion, we won't spontaneously acquire it, and we *should* grow out of our childish, naive thinking. Religion anchors to that thinking and reinforces it, thus forcing its believers to maintain it through adulthood.\n\nFortunately, some of us manage to reason our way out of the trap, which is why, at least with the religion I was fed as a child, a component of the religious meme complex is to *not* subject one's belief to rational inquiry. For whatever reason, some of us can't help doing just that. As such an individual, it perplexed me for many years how otherwise intelligent and rational people could shield their irrational beliefs from the same logic they applied to other questions. \n\nReligions may be 'fake as fuck', as you said, but they are evolved memes that are very good at propagating themselves.","score":"1","subreddit":"atheism"}

There is no link between abortion and child abuse.

If anything not getting married early, which most Christian sects now encourage, would reduce divorce, abortion, and economic troubles. Also abortion isn't evil, in fact, there was a recent study that finished that showed that in poorer areas when abortion was legalized, crime fell off when the children that would have been born would have been adults, because abortion prevented children being born into situations where crime would have been the only way to make a living, because crime is no the result of an image evil within men, but the result of poverty, desperation, and a lack of opportunities.

The conflict between religion and science is inherent and (very nearly) zero-sum.

It is time we conceded a basic fact of human discourse: either a person has good reasons for what he believes, or he does not. When a person has good reasons, his beliefs contribute to our growing understanding of the world. For instance, there happen to be very good reasons to believe that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. Consequently, the idea that the Egyptians actually did it lacks credibility. Every sane human being recognizes that to rely merely upon “faith” to decide specific questions of historical fact would be both idiotic and grotesque – that is, until the conversation turns to the origin of books like the Bible. The breadth of our scientific understanding includes all reasonable claims to knowledge about ourselves and the world.

{"body":"Not much doubt IMHO - pure myth!  \n  \nThe time when Jesus was supposed to have been alive was a strange time it is difficult for us to understand.  \n  \nI strongly suggest anyone interested in the topic also reads [Kooks and Quacks of the Roman Empire: A Look into the World of the Gospels](http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/kooks.html):  \n\u0026gt; We all have read the tales told of Jesus in the Gospels, but few people really have a good idea of their context. Yet it is quite enlightening to examine them against the background of the time and place in which they were written, and my goal here is to help you do just that. There is abundant evidence that these were times replete with kooks and quacks of all varieties, from sincere lunatics to ingenious frauds, even innocent men mistaken for divine, and there was no end to the fools and loons who would follow and praise them. Placed in this context, the gospels no longer seem to be so remarkable, and this leads us to an important fact: when the Gospels were written, skeptics and informed or critical minds were a small minority. Although the gullible, the credulous, and those ready to believe or exaggerate stories of the supernatural are still abundant today, they were much more common in antiquity, and taken far more seriously.  \n  \nand  \n\u0026gt; Even in Acts, we get an idea of just how gullible people could be. Surviving a snake bite was evidently enough for the inhabitants of Malta to believe that Paul himself was a god (28:6). And Paul and his comrade Barnabas had to go to some lengths to convince the Lycaonians of Lystra that they were not deities. For the locals immediately sought to sacrifice to them as manifestations of Hermes and Zeus, simply because a man with bad feet stood up (14:8-18). These stories show how ready people were to believe that gods can take on human form and walk among them, and that a simple show was sufficient to convince them that mere men were such divine beings. And this evidence is in the bible itself.  \n  \nand \n\u0026gt; Miracles were also a dime a dozen in this era. The biographer Plutarch, a contemporary of Josephus, engages in a lengthy digression to prove that a statue of Tyche did not really speak in the early Republic (Life of Coriolanus 37.3). He claims it must have been a hallucination inspired by the deep religious faith of the onlookers, since there were, he says, too many reliable witnesses to dismiss the story as an invention (38.1-3). He even digresses further to explain why other miracles such as weeping or bleeding--even moaning--statues could be explained as natural phenomena, showing a modest but refreshing degree of skeptical reasoning that would make the Amazing Randi proud. What is notable is not that Plutarch proves himself to have some good sense, but that he felt it was necessary to make such an argument at all. Clearly, such miracles were still reported and believed in his own time. I find this to be a particularly interesting passage, since we have thousands of believers flocking to weeping and bleeding statues even today. Certainly the pagan gods must also exist if they could make their statues weep and bleed as well!  \n  \nRead it all and learn about the time.","score":"11","subreddit":"atheism"}

{"body":"The thing is, Scientology *qua* Scientology is not indefensible. Or at least, it's no more or less indefensible than any other set of religious principles. It's unprovable, sure. But it's also unfalsifiable, in the same way that any other metaphysical or religious theorem is unfalsifiable. \n\nOne can critique the actions of the Church on moral and legal grounds. One can falsify Hubbard's empirical claims (like in the Fischer Study, for instance). One can even document the efficacy (or lack thereof) of admin tech, as in the Allstate Insurance debacle. \n\nBut all the other stuff: theta-mest theory, overts and motivators, the dynamics, cycles of action and communication, etc; are unfalsifiable metaphysical claims. \n\nTo use an analogy, you can argue in favour of evolution. But you cannot disprove the existence of God. It's the same principle here. That's part of the reason why I personally consider Scientology to be a religion.\n\nNow, I'm more interested in exactly what Scientology *does*. It doesn't do what Hubbard says it did, or in the way that he said it did. But it certainly does *something*. The lower level stuff on the bridge is really cool. I'm interested in - and agree with - the statement you made in the comments on your blog.

I'm a psychologist, so I know rage when I see it.  They've approached me aggressively and they take advantage of the fact that they hold the power. \n\nFor example, years ago when I first moved into Boston from the suburbs, I was driving home late one night from work.  I found that one of the streets leading to my apartment had work being done.  There was a large gap in the cones that were set up, and it seemed clear to me that that was where thru traffic was supposed to go.  As I turned down the road, I heard an extremely loud noise (that buzzer that cruisers have) and looked in my mirror to see the cop driving behind me about six inches off of my bumper. He kept tailgating me so that I couldn't pull over/stop without being rear ended, so I literally just had to slow down until I could come to a stop.\n\nWhen he came to my window, I began to say \"sorry, I thought this lane was open,\" but before I could finish, he got in my face and started screaming (\"are you a fucking idiot? does it look like you can drive here?\").  I apologized again, completely flustered, but he continued.  He told me to \"get the fuck out of here\" and I told him that I was new here and was just trying to get home, asking which way I should go to get back to where I was going (this was before phone GPS so I had no idea).  He said \"I don't give a shit, just get out of here.\" So, I had to drive away and it took me about thirty minutes to get back to where I was supposed to be.\n\nThat's a pretty standard police encounter for me.

My dad has a slightly crazy mother. My dad lives in, let's say, Arizona. His dad lives in, let's say, Oregon. My dad's grandma lives in, let's say, Michigan. My dad asked his dad to wait in Oregon until he drove there so that they could drive to Michigan together. My dad's sister couldn't go because of work or something.

I use it because the battery is amazing, its size is compact, the screen is perfect and the backlight is perfect for reading in the dark or place where there is less light.\n\nI haven't tried, but I don't think you can access a different store.

But if you want to read on your tablet or smartphone, you have a couple of different stores you can access.\n\n2) Amazon offers a service similar to Netflix for books.

Contrary to popular believe that trashcan is not for everything made out of plastic\n- paper and cardboard belongs into the blue trashcan\n- glass bottles and other glass containers belong into the correct (!) glass trash container. They are not at your house, you might have to walk a bit to get to them. Green glass into the green container, white to white and brown to brown. Every other color belongs into the green container. Glass things like old window panels or vases don't belong into the glass container at all. \n- food and kitchen-waste belongs into the brown bio trashcan\n- everything else goes into the black trashcan\n- if you have too much trash in your black trashcan, don't simply put bags in front of your trashcan, it won't be picked up. your municipality sells special trash bags that will be picked up if you put them next to your trashcan\n- if you have too much trash in your yellow trashcan, you might get some yellow bags (these are special, not just yellow colored bags) to make sure that it will be picked up. They are free (you paid for them when you bought the product that has the Grüne Punkt)\n- don't put bulk trash that is too large for your trashcan in front of your trashcan, contact your municipality and request bulk trash pickup\n- bulk trash pickup will take your washing machine but not a refrigerator\n- batteries don't belong into the trashcan, bring them back to a store\n- electronics don't go into the trashcan either, call your local electronic waste collection facility\n- buckets with not yet dried wall-paint are hazardous waste, every 6 months the municipality will come to a place near you with a truck to collect such things\n- buckets with wall-paint that has already dried belong into the black trashcan\n- energy saving light bulbs are hazardous trash as well. Non energy saving light bulbs go into the black trashcan\n- ...\n- ...\n- ...\n\n---\n\nBut seriously, the lack of knowledge about our trash system is one of the larger issues people have with asylum seekers who live nearby.

The Syrians have learned how it's done the German way, but the Kosovars can't be bothered and don't give a shit. \n\nWe take our trash very seriously. But things like trash pickup cycles require that you take it at least a bit seriously. In my apartment block, residual waste (black trashcan) is only picked up every 14 days. We only have one large trash container. We have a yellow one for packaging, which is picked up every week.

This is to say that in Portugal (and this is not particular to Portugal or the Portuguese Empire, it is similar to what was used in Spain as well but also France, etc) the approach was based on a caste system with those from Iberian on top, followed by Europeans born abroad and then by a stratification of castes which had native american, Indian or African blood.\n\nNow, does this mean that there was no \"one drop rule\"? It depends. Yes, there were more categories than simply \"white\" and \"black\", but that is also true if you consider that in the North American colonies there were also names for different \"mixes\" (e.g. \"octoroon\"), and those categories had at times an implied social standing that enabled a kind of social participation that was not confined to, say, slavery. But one should note that being considered \"mixed raced\" isn't in opposition to being \"black\": the categories are mostly defined by exclusion and as such a \"mixed raced\" individual will be considered \"black\" when talking broadly, and not white, at least not in Portugal (and most of Europe).\n\n\n","score":"1","subreddit":"europe"}

We're not some dark cabal of programmers, it's not hazing, we actually need you to be able to do this shit.\n\nThat is perfectly fine. If that is what you need, that is what you need. You should not hire anyone that doesn't fit your needs.\n\nYour mistake is that you are looking at the very specific problems you face daily (like the stuff you mentioned) and turn around and think people are unqualified for not being able to solve them. Or, not good enough. \n\nThis is why developers are frustrated from interviews like these, because people like you are inherently dismissive of other people's professional lives. If someone has past experience (and, preferably, projects to show) then that person has proven to have delivered value to the market, regardless of your opinion.\n\nAnd have you been formally trained how to interview someone? I hope you have, because everyone else I know has not. We just wing it. Which was the original point.\n\n\u0026gt; Why is that a problem? You're being hired as a programmer, we're going to check if you can do at least basic stuff before we bring you in. I don't see how that's unreasonable.\n\nMost people, including myself, dislike whiteboard tests because its stressful and annoying. How about giving the candidate a laptop and 10 minutes (or a specific amount of time)? Way easier. But ultimately that should be up to the candidate and not you, because this isn't high school, its a job interview and that means both sides need to meet in the middle. \n\nFor example in the company I work now they actually asked me, do I want to use the whiteboard or my laptop? Very helpful. Looking back, I should have demanded the same from other companies. \n\n\u0026gt; I'm sorry, but do you realize who entitled you sound right now?\n\nIt's OK. It goes both ways my friend. I wouldn't work with you and since you wouldn't work with my either, please don't change your hiring process for me. \n\n\u0026gt; Just because you don't see the value of something doesn't mean it's stupid or wrong. If you want people to hire you, make sure you've got the skills to do the job. The jobs I interview for require basic knowledge of math and algos. And if you don't want to spend time acquiring those skills, that's your choice, but don't piss on me for trying to hire people that meet my bar.\n\nYou seem determined to make this personal. But I don't really care about people hiring me because I have a decent job and if I ever want another one then I am capable of being hired. \n\nIt seems you actually have a problem finding people. I would recommend, instead of complaining, you should hire the best candidate (or should I say the \"least terrible\" one?) and try to groom him or her into the developer you need. But that requires assessing someone's learning capabilities, which is more difficult than just throwing him a list of algorithms. \n\nIn short, waiting for a \"rockstar\" or \"unicorm\" developer to appear might end up costing more than just hiring an average developer and molding him or her to your needs.\n\nAnd I can only repeat your advice: Just because you don't see the value in some people does not mean that they are bad (as you said \"don't even know the basics\"). I am sure you are great with these algorithms but that does not make you a qualified judge of value. And that is the original point, few people -if any- can judge. ","score":"1","subreddit":"europe"}

Unfortunately for a common foreign policy we need a political union, for a political union, we need a fiscal union, and all this is just not happening any time soon.

I would say most people in EE would calm down if they knew that the EU would be sending at most a few thousands of refugees, but as for now they don't believe that the EU can do anything about limiting the numbers of the migrants and many don't even believe that the EU is even trying to do that, they think that the \"refugees welcome\" attitude is basicaly the EU's official policy. So when the EU proposes pernament quota system people (including me) will find that unacceptable, because there is no upper limit at all and we can't possibly know how many that would be in the future. We don't know how the EU will handle the next big refugee crisis (and looking at the demographic, climate and political prospects of the MENA region, I'm pretty sure there will be a future crisis). If the EU handles the next crisis as badly as this one and the quota system is already in place, it could mean we would be getting tens of thousands of people.

Friedman gives two possible scenarios: that the government will expel outside interests and rule with an iron fist to keep the country from fragmenting, or that China will fragment, with the central government gradually losing much of its real power and the provinces becoming increasingly autonomous.

Throughout history, civil conflicts have rarely broken out on subnational or town-level scales - if it's a question of regional identity, it's almost always national identity that is in question. At some point you can't trust others to have the same common interest as you - and in very large nations, that does indeed happen. You can either decentralize, as Russia does in some cases, or crush all subentities and assimilate them as best you can, as Russia does in other cases and the US has always done.

(Also due to protesters in the secured area). At first a lot of traffic was diverted to SAW then to other Turkish airports. Some flights decided to turn around, but it was mostly foreign airlines. I think Turkish continued to turkey and even stated landing in IST again right after the runway was clear. They reopened the airport quite fast after the whole incident, especially considering that everyone was able to walk past security and could have brought everything in the secured area, implying that everything is alright. That is way the US FAA canceled all flights to and from IST airport. ","score":"2","subreddit":"europe"}

{"body":"First of all, sorry for the late answer, and thanks a lot for this grand answer :)\n\nOn your first point I agree completely. It was already seen in Greece how the \"the EU made us do this\"-defence was used successfully time and time again by corrupt politicians who rather sacrificed 1000 teacher jobs than a single one of their cronie's posts. Sometimes I believe the troika rather stabiliszed an entrenched elite by giving them and their media power a believable scapegoat.\n\nI also believe it is legitimate to vote leave without wanting to leave too much. What no one, not even the most die-hard supporter is saying is that the EU is in need of reform. That point is actually valid. Each major stateman has also said at least once that the way to push reform in the european institutions is by crisis.\n\nFinally, I kept reading articles about London's crazy housing market. It is a fair point to be upset to spent half your salary on rent just to have \"only\" 1 hour of commute every day, like a friend of mine is doing.\n\nIn the end I can understand the arguments of the leave votum minus the populism a lot more.

And the EU also doesn't want a \"little United Kingdom\" with their weird status in the EU. Not to mention that they don't have the necessary laws and regulations for such a process (of inheritance).\n\nThe EU cannot get involved in inner British politics of course and offer a Scotland a \"sweet deal\" that just requires them to leave the UK. If they would do that, there would be suddenly twenty seperatist movements in Europe who want to get out of their countries but keep their place in the EU. They will have to walk a thin line between enthusiasm for continued membership of Scotland in the EU and not getting involved in inner British politics.\n\nApparently there have been informal talks in Brussels about a transitional status for Scotland, so that they don't have to leave the EU and all its institutions just to immediately start a process to come back in. I think that was already too much talk about a possible soultion at this early stage in the Brexit process. That's almost like telling seperatist movements that the EU wont let them drop out of everything if they would seek independence from their countries. It's a very tricky process, and timing is everything.\n\nI'm a bit afraid that the Scotish people expect a clear roadmap into independence and back into the EU via a transitional status. That roadmap probably won't be negotiable before Scotland is independent though or Westminster have given their approval to such talks. If the people of Scotland want to seek independence, they should probably do so on the basis of being independent and having the freedom to make their own decisions (in regards to the EU). Of course the EU would happy to welcome them back in the family, and they would have strong interest to make the transition as easy as possible without an \"out and back in\" circus. But we need a clear playing field, and only Westminster and Scotland can create that playing field.\n\nP.S.: And we shouldn't blow these implications and considerations into the wind just because we love Scotland, William Wallace, Scotish Whiskey and hot British/Nordic redheads.

{"body":"The linked article is an attack on [donor-advised funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor-advised_fund) ([DAFs](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds)), which are investment accounts that:\n\n* Allow one to claim the tax deduction for charitable giving\n\n* Allow one to delay the actual delivery of money to a needy recipient\n\n* Grow in the meantime (because the fund is being invested)\n\nDAFs have grown rapidly in popularity ($20b in contributions in 2014), and it's not hard to see why: they reduce the cost of philanthropy relative to the status quo, because they allow people to time their donations without affecting tax liability.\n\nI'm a big fan of private philanthropy. Private philanthropy, if plentiful enough and effective enough, obviates much of the case for government. The authors rightly point out:\n\n\u0026gt; In other countries it is common for universities, hospitals, art museums, symphonies, and social safety nets to be funded by governments. In the US, charitable organizations, supported by tax-favored private donations, carry out many of the same social functions.\n\nBut the authors are not fans of DAFs as the law currently construes them. One reason is that investors' money might never get donated:\n\n\u0026gt; ...legal agreements between donors and DAF sponsors in fact provide that the donor cedes all legal control over donated funds. Although a donor is given the right to make recommendations (sometimes referred to as “advisory privileges”), this is not much of a “right.” DAF sponsors are legally allowed to ignore donors’ advice about the disposition of their DAF funds.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that this is not usually a problem because\n\n\u0026gt; the business model of commercial DAF sponsors is to profit from the fees they secure and not from appropriating donor funds.\n\nBut it has happened, apparently.\n\nIn any case, that's not the authors' main problem with DAFs. They give several objections:\n\n* DAFs reduce tax revenue.\n\n* DAFs benefit the rich more than the poor.\n\n* DAFs disrupt the flow of donations.\n\nOf these three objections, the third is the most serious. The first is not actually an objection, at least not without some more information. The authors do not justify the implicit claim that a given dollar does more good if it goes to the IRS than to a DAF. Surely it matters what happens next to that dollar--is it spent on a hospital, a business loan, or [an air strike that kills civilians and in a war of questionable relevance to American defense](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syria-least-85-civilians-feared-dead-after-us-air-strike-mistake-1571600)? (Of course, I'm ignoring any moral issues with taxation itself.)\n\nThe third objection is more interesting. The authors say that what used to be annual, Christmas donations are no longer necessary now that the money need not go to a charity in the same year it leaves the donor's pocket. If charitable organizations' incomes really are lesss predictable than before, then that could be a problem, but the authors don't support the claim that this is happening.\n\nIn any case, I'm more concerned with the *amount* of money that goes to charitable organizations. As far as I can tell, the authors don't say that charitable organizations are getting less money because of DAFs. None of the papers I browsed say so either. And if DAFs make it easier to give, then perhaps on net they will increase funding for American civil society. At least, that's what I'd hope.\n\n*Additional sources*\n\n* [The Economics of Donor Advised Funds](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1588069\u0026amp;), 2008\n\n* [Donor Advised Funds: Charitable Spending Vehicles for 21st Century Philanthropy\n](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2677297), 2015\n\n* [The Missing Tax Benefit of Donor-Advised Funds](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2749137), 2016\n\nP.S. One line struck out as indicative that the authors might not know too much about economics:\n\n\u0026gt; The effect of these rules is that assets that have been given the tax benefits of charitable donations can be held in a DAF for decades or even centuries, all the while earning management fees for the financial institutions managing the funds, and *producing no social value*. (emphasis added)\n\nBut money that's sitting in an account does produce social value, because it is invested into profitable enterprises--that's how the pie grows.","score":"1","subreddit":"Libertarian"}

Protesting is a huge part of Ukrainian history, the most recent Maiden protests were just that- the most recent. The protests started over regular, legitimate reasons. Yanukovych made overtly corrupt decisions that upset the people in the Capital. Yanukovych then **banned protesting**, knowing *without a doubt* that would only intensify the protests, so that he could use the police against his own people since they were breaking his brand new \"no protesting\" law.  Every person the police killed or beat made the protests stronger instead of weaker. The protests *he created*  started getting out of hand, and Yanukovych immediately fled to Putin. The Ukrainian parliament legally voted to impeach him. The coup itself, the things that happened allowing it, were all objectively legal. Americans wanted it to happen, and they had no right to hold that opinion \u0026amp; no right to encourage it. But to say *they orchestrated it*, without even mentioning the meddling on the Russian side, is to prove how ignorant and biased youre understanding of this is. \n\nAgain, this is a small part of the story. The Russian and Ukrainian corruption goes back centuries, but the stage was set the way it was because of decades of Russian-supported corruption in Ukraine. Again, that doesnt absolve the Ukrainian mistakes, but it makes clear who the oppressor in this situation is.\n\nI dont want you to take my word for any of this though.

{"body":"I'll just copy and paste this because I don't have time to write a personal one tonight-\n\nFor lunch I usually do either eggs on toast with beans, breakfast burritos, oatmeal, or cereal and fruit(depending on the day). The most expensive of these meals will run you ~$1, and that's the breakfast burrito.\n\nFor breakfast burritos, I use a tortilla, rice, salsa, cheese, lettuce, beans, and corn. You should make these in bulk and then you'll be able to freeze them. Everything else is pretty self-explanatory. Even just eating the breakfast burritos, the two of you shouldn't spend more than $60 per month total on breakfast.\n\nFor lunch I usually do sandwiches or smoothies. I sometimes treat myself to some frozen pizza as well. Smoothies are probably the most expensive things I eat, coming in at around $1.75 per smoothie(they're worth it, though). Sandwiches vary quite a bit in terms of price, but you can usually make them for $1-$2 depending on how expensive deli meats and cheese is where you are. A maximum per month on lunch would be around $75-100 for the both of you. You certainly could do this cheaper, but the quality and variety of the food takes quite the hit.\n\nFor dinner I usually opt for pasta. Pasta is incredibly cheap and easy to make. The examples I've been giving other people are mainly Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo and Spaghetti with meat sauce(or cheese sauce). Pasta and meat combinations are great because you can change it up every night of the week and still get a healthy, cheap meal. I eat a lot of this stuff and my cost per meal is around $2. That comes in at $120 per month on dinners for the both of you. You could do this cheaper, but the quality and variety of food would be reduced quite a bit.\n\nOverall your monthly grocery bill should be around $280 total. That's around $9 total per day, or $4.50 per person. You certainly could get this much cheaper(as much as half)- but that would require you to live off ramen and potatoes.\n\nIn general, you want to shop at cheap places. I've been told immigrant grocery stores have fairly good prices, but Walmart is my go-to(or a similar type of store).\n\nYou'll want to stick to meats which are on sale, ground beef, and chicken. Generally frozen meat isn't that much more affordable than fresh meat, so I buy the fresh stuff and freeze it. Though if frozen meat is cheaper in your location, go with that(it's literally the same stuff).\n\nFor vegetables and fruits- with the exception of lettuce and potatoes, frozen vegetables are almost always cheaper. You can get a kilogram of carrots/beans/corn for something like $2.47. Dehydrated vegetables and fruits are the cheapest, but a bit of a pain in the ass. Don't bother with canned stuff unless it's on sale or considerably cheaper than fresh/frozen. Frozen berries are my go to. You can usually get a pound or more frozen berries for the price of a half pound of fresh ones. Always buy bananas fresh.\n\nPastas and pasta sauces are very cheap. Buy the store brand if you can and it will be even cheaper. Same with eggs and milk.\n\nHope this helps any questions let me know!","score":"2","subreddit":"canada"}

{"body":"this has been happening for a long time.  While not all muslim based trucking companies are run this way, there are a bunch of scummy ones still who pull this crap.  They run garbage, on bald tires, that never gets maintained unless something literally falls off.  They know they can game the system by screaming discrimination.  With MTO, if they scream discrimination, said officer is put on unpaid suspention following a review (which can take up to 6 months).  So they are afraid of getting involved in a discrimination case. \n\nThe other problem, is much more serious, and is known as CVOR fraud.  I have had it happen to a few friends in Ontario.  They illegitimately obtain the CVOR number for a company, and pull the record of said company (can be done online for $25).  What happens then, is they take a previously bad CVOR certificate, scan it, make changes and re-print it.  Now they can go to the DMV and register trucks.  If anyone says anything, they stand there and scream discrimination, as the same process for DMV employees exists as the MTO.  They then run under said running rights until the company is out of points (much like a driver's licence, once you loose enough you can't run  your company anymore).  When the company owner finds out, they have moved on to the next company to do this to, and the OPP refuse to do a fraud invesitgation as they don't want to appear as \"islamaphobic.\"\n\nThe other problem which is being attempted to deal with is the CDL mills, where they have a driving school with either a full course or \"individual lessons.\"   The MTO has been attacking the ones that were the $399 3 day CDL courses as they found them to be crooked. They also had the ones that had their \"designated test dummy\" for an extra $500 who would do the test for them.  They got shut down and jailed if they were caught (huge fraud).  \n\nThe drunk driving?  This happens, you see it much more often in northern Ontario than southern, but it does happen.  More than once i have seen beer cans roll out of a truck when they pull into a truck stop to get fuel, and more than once watched an OPP officer ignore this and do absolutely nothing about it.  It's a huge double standard in Ontario.  I've been through the Westhawk, MB scale, and watched them stumbling out of the trucks, drunk, often to be given a Breathalyzer.  It has been cleaned up for a while, but it starting to go back to the same crap.  \n\nYou are hearing a lot of stuff lately about wheel-off situations again, yes.  It's the same bunch.  What people don't realize though, it's a $10,000 fine to the driver, and $100,000 fine to the company.  However, if it's a stolen CVOR they don't care.\n\nWhen these trucks come to eastern Canada they are heavily watched, and very often given a Level 1 (full mechanical inspection), and pulled off the road if unsafe.  We don't subscribe to the crap about letting them get away with this crap.  More than once i have seen them in shops, where the driver is muslim, and refuses to have anything more than a couple simple things fixed, while there are serious things wrong with the truck.  everything from bald tires, to bad wheel bearings, to things ready to fall off and kill someone.  I've seen them passing licences back and forth at DOT inspections (and at US Customs - that was funny watching them get separated and escorted to the back rooms). \n\nThe rumours about the holes in the floors of trucks? They are true.  i have seen them on multiple occasions. When they are caught down here, they are pulled off the road (open holes are not allowed in the cab of a truck, due to issues of off-gassing), and required to fix it.  Also if there is feces covering the frame of the truck, they are charged with improper disposal of human waste, and the truck is deemed a biohazzard.  No shops down here will work on them, it's not worth the trouble.  They don't want to fix the problems, and only want \"a receipt saying it was fixed\".  It has gotten to the point, where Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have changed their Level 1 \u0026amp; Level 2 inspections to check for a hole under the cab of the trucks so they don't get splattered in shit.\n\nTLDR: Ontario... safety is a joke.","score":"12","subreddit":"canada"}

While parts of the bible were translated from Aramaic (Jesus's teachings) to Greek to Latin to German to English. And later on the English translations were improved by looking back at the Greek/Latin, but the meaning had already been corrupted. The translators own bias can even effect the word choice too. This is why learning and preserving the original language is critical (in Islam we even put marks to make sure every letter gets pronounced correctly, so the meaning does not change overtime that way.)\n\nAlso I'm assuming you believe that not all Christians are \"true\" so who's to say that those Christians don't evangelize their own version of Christianity and spread the falsehood to the point where a lot (or most) Christians are actually following the \"un-true\" Christians.\n\nAlso again, I can believe that those interlinear translations of the bible are corrupted because their are different versions of the Greek and Hebrew. Also, a lot of the modern bible is said to be derived from different [source texts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism_(biblical_studies))\n\nAlso, I heard some Christians say that somehow [Romans 1:32](http://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm) says that homosexuals are worthy of death... talk about radical translations.\n\n\u0026gt; While reading the torah\n\nThis is just me being a little nit-picky but the Prophet Muhummad was illiterate...\n\nAlso, you mention one verse where God says he will punish those who add to the scripture, 100% agree, but you haven't responded to where I say clarify that the bible we have today is not the scriptures given to Moses, David, Solomon, and Jesus because they simply do not fit the description:\n\n\u0026gt; Please give me the Quranic (or any other) references to the claim that you make that God would protect other holy scriptures until the end of time. Also, what part of the Quran do you refer to as \"out version of Revelations?\"\nAlso, what reference are there that support the claim that Muhummad thought that the bible was 100% true earlier on in his life? And you do realize that the OT was kept as an oral tradition until the time of Babylon, and even Christians believe that Moses probably didn't write the entire Torah.\nAs Muslims we believe that the modern Tanak is a corrupted version of the of the scripture revealed to Moses (called the Toraak in the Quran.) Likewise the Zaboor (revealed to prophet David) might be the un corrupted version of the Psalms of David. My point is, that the bible was probably slowly corrupted and intentionally changed hundreds of years before Muhummad, and looks nothing like the scriptures and renal toons revealed to prophets of the Israelites.\nSimilarly, the injeel (the gospel) is supposed to be a set of revelations given directly too Jesus (not a story of his life written some 50 odd years afterwords.)\n\nAlso, the Quran speaks about altercations in the previous books of Allah four times, chiefly in 2:79 and 4:46. But even though they are altered, they are still rooted in the word of God, so Muslims should still hold it in high regard, but if any contradiction appears between those books and the Quran, the Quran should be listened to because it is more authentic.\n\nBtw, looking at later Islamic scholors (or event the taba'in or taba taba'in) for interpretation of Islam is not help as highly as looking at the Quran, the practice of Muhummad (the sunnah) and the sayings of muhummad (the Hadith).\n\nExplain this, I do not understand what you are saying (like give an example):\n\n\u0026gt;  (while Allah ironically addresses himself on pretty much every page as if he's Muhammad)\n\nAnd that quotations of Muhummad that you say somehow proves Allah spoke as Muhummad or something weird like that is a Hadith, which be definition are quotes attributed to the Prophet Muhummad which can expand upon Quranic principals to give us a more profound understanding of the religion.\n\nWe believe that 100% of the Quran is true, and categorically deny the concept of \"satanic versus.\" \n\nAlso the chapter \"Aal-e-Imran\" refers to the family of Mary mother of Jesus. I got my wires crossed and made a mistake by saying the father of Moses was not named Imran, while in fact he was. But that does not change the fact that you have not provided ONE verse where it says that the sister of Moses gave birth to Jesus. I am not excusing this \"huge\" mistake, I am merely saying that it DOES NOT exist. Please try to give more evidence to your claims from now on. I am not trying to seem rude, but am just being practical.\n\nIn Islam we view the elevation of Mary by Christians (such as the catholics) to be akin to idol worship. Just look at My Lady of Guadalupe and the Holy Fatima. Even some protestant friends of mine told me that (much to the chagrin of my catholic friends.)\n\nThe evidence you gave for Muhummad being created before Adam was \"created\" are only Hadith with very weak lineage. And if any Hadith contradict the Quran, the Quran is what we listen to. And that Hadith does contradict the Quran.\n\nThe paradise in Islam is not filled with carnal desires... firstly things like God, Paradise, or Hell are not imaginable for humans according to Islam. That's why humanish attributes are given to God (ie God can \"see\" you) or paradise is described as being full of rivers of milk and honey.\n\nI'm going to reply to the second comment in the second section.","score":"1","subreddit":"Christianity"}

{"body":"Thank you for sharing, it can definitely be tough what the enemy does through us in marring the name of the one we all claim to serve. I hope the council I am about  suggest will be of some value to you; enough for you to, as you said, think.\n\nFirstly, I will say that these are the avenues by which many of the enemies of God are able to blaspheme. Many think the Christian walk is a walk in the park. And so, when they turn away or look on from afar with their criticisms, these kinds of revelations of fellow brothers and sisters who struggle as much as, or less than we do, proves to be a bolstering of their disdain for God's name, and He is wrongly attributed with all of our selfish \u0026amp; sinful lifestyles, as we claim to represent Him; when disobedience is rampant in our ranks that forfeit many of the blessings promised in His word. This is a Christian community (so called), but it isn't merely Christians that most frequent these pages. They watch, they look for answers for the improving of their lives. If they see no difference in the lives of us vs theirs, they conclude they are correct in their biased assessment that the religion of Christ is false—though none of whom they witness, practice the religion of Christ. God's professed people have a form of godliness, but deny the power. In other words, doubt is why we're so rampant with disobedience. You won't obey a commandment to \"trust Me,\" if we doubt the One who said it can actually deliver. In future, consider being more—for lack of a better word—merciful in your observations of what makes some of the brothers/sisters weak, while stuggling to follow Christ as they understand.\n\nIt could be, these people were placed in your life (or vice versa, really. It was you who left your church, not them) to be edified by you, who has all that you've described them lacking. The best we can do when we see others not up to a standard is to bring them up with us. Teach them how to be punctual, emotionally stable, or encourage them when they are weak. This isn't a spectator sport, but a joint effort in being our brothers and sisters's keeper.\n\nAnd secondly, I think I can save you some time. God sees the world in two parts(unlike us with many self perceived fragments): Obedient, disobedient. Light, darkness. Right, left. Righteousness, unrighteousness. Truth, error. No in between or variant; one or the other. If you're looking for a church, the **only** standard should be if truth is found there. If truth is not there, no matter how flamboyant or exalting its appearance in the fellowship or any other socially appealing aspect it may have, you're not being lined up to be filled as you seek to be—as we should be. Where truth is, the Spirit is; irrespective of feelings. Many mistake the feelings they have for the Spirit. I'll go as far as to say that God's Spirit cannot be felt; He is experienced in another way. Remember Christ said, just as the wind, the Spirit moves as it chooses, going from here or there and we cannot tell the beginning or end. He makes no mention of feeling it. He says when you **hear it**. The only way you can even perceive the Holy Spirit's work in someone is if you hear it. Not even see; only hear. You don't see, feel, taste or smell truth, you hear it. This is Biblical—\n\n- “*So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.*” - Romans 10:17 KJV\n\n- “*Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not* ***prophesied in thy name***? *and in thy name have* ***cast out devils***? *and in thy name* ***done many wonderful works***? *And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that* ***work iniquity***.” - Matthew 7:21‭-‬23 KJV\n\nWe may see and feel many spectacular things, but at the end of the day, it is those who hear the Spirit of Truth that can correctly say they've experienced Him.\n\n- “*Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive,* ***because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him***: *but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.*” - John 14:17 KJV\n\n- “*But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the* ***Spirit of truth***, *which proceedeth from the Father,* ***he shall testify of me***.” - John 15:26 KJV\n\n- “*Howbeit when he, the* ***Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself***; *but* ***whatsoever he shall hear***, *that shall he* ***speak***: *and he will shew you things to come.*” - John 16:13 KJV\n\nTruth is our only Standard. Not church tradition, manual, feeling, customs or culture. **\"Is there TRUTH being taught from God's word, and it alone?\"** What a church believes, teaches or practices, can it be backed up fully in God's word? Now, thanks be to God where truth is found, you'll also find genuine relationships. You'll find a hand to guide you when you're lost, an ear to hear your grievances and friendships that can stand the test of trials. Where truth resides, Satan hates. A church with truth is not without hardships; they are being made pure. One of the main differences is that you'll **hear** Biblical council that is more than enough to satisfy our emotional pains, that we needn't air-out our laundry in the sight of onlooking critics of Christ and His church—the people(not a building merely)—with **truth**.\n\nI pray God guides you in your search.

Prayer doesn't heal any better than placebo, in some cases it has been shown to leave the patient worse (more nocebo than divine intervention there though), Christians are also just as susceptible to poison as anyone else despite claims made by Jesus in Mark 16:18.

{"body":"Let me answer your question in a slightly different way.  Do you agree that Jesus was a historical person?  Most *credible* scholars (religious and secular) agree that Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical person who walked the Earth in the region of Galilee.  Jesus taught His disciples that if they saw Him they've seen the Father.  Paul writes in Colossians 1:15 that [Jesus] is the image of the invisible God and the writer of Hebrews calls Jesus the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of [the Father's] nature (Heb. 1:3).  So I would tend to agree with you that it is hard to believe in a God who is invisible and unable to be perceived by humans.  The God of the Bible, however, is not like that.  If Jesus is who He says He is, the image of the invisible God, then God literally came down and walked among us.  He may not be here now but we have four corroborating accounts of His life on Earth and Apostles who were witnesses of what Jesus said and did.\n\nSo there's more to base faith off of than blind hope.  Jesus said He was God in the flesh and lived among men and did miraculous works and was raised from the dead to validate all that He said and did.  Jesus said in John 14:11, *\"Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.*\"","score":"1","subreddit":"Christianity"}

Let's say those who don't know god won't suffer, what about those who don't belive in him?\n\nMeaning, ultimately all will have to accept him as Savior in order to find God. but those who don't know are never said in the Bible to be condemned to hellfire. \n\nAs for those who don't believe in him, by good works and living a moral life as an atheist, you still have a good chance of entering Heaven as well.\n\n\u0026gt; That's exactly how hell works in most denominations. I can't tell you one interpretation which is more known than that. I literally could show you thousands of people who believe in that.\n\n/u/Savemebarrry, **MY BEST FRIEND EVER**, is a Mormon, as such they believe that Hell is only temporary for sinners, and not eternal. Speaking as a Catholic, Hell is a place where you distant yourself from God, unless you reject his forgiveness and blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, or die in a state of mortal sin, you are a candidate for hell, but Hell within Catholicism has never been painted as 'fire and brimstone' that is more traditional amongst Protestants, i.e. Southern Baptists, Hell within Catholicism is a place without God, undescribable and just as terrible, but it can't be described as 'torture' and the blame can't be put on God, because you distanced yourself from God. Let's talk about Mortal Sin, with the concept of Mortal Sin, one of the many elements to commit it is full knowledge of wrongdoing, if you're an atheist and you commit mortal sins without believing that they are wrong, then there is no guarantee you will be sent to Hell, in general, the concept of Purgatory seems to suggest the same thing, that we will be cleansed and judged by Christ then sent to either Hell or Purgatory, whose to say Christ wouldn't be merciful?\n\n\u0026gt; That is a paradoxon. God created us, and he knows what happens in our future. If he knows our fate, how is that free will?\n\nHe exists outside of time, restriction, or anything that could be considered linear, being the creator, he makes the choice to do nothing in hopes that we will step up in his place and show our true selves, as made in his image, he knows the consequences of every path we take, and ultimately what we will or won't take. In other words, we will still be able to make choices independent from God, and in many cases those choices can bring us closer, or further away from God, he simply does not intervene and thus that gives us free choice.\n\n\u0026gt; In most cases God doesn't give us a choice. First off there is not a exact definition what's good and what's evil. Is it evil to have sex before marriage? Is it good to kill every newborn child in a country?\n\nSex before marriage is a sin, sin is evil. It is not good to kill every newborn child in a country. In all of those cases you've listed, those are choices, you can choose not to have sex, and you can choose not to kill, unless you think that people have no choice.\n\n\u0026gt;God didn't have to set the rule that sin is only forgivable with blood.\n\nGod doesn't have to do *anything* but he did, that's why he's so amazing and you should welcome him into your life, he gave us this world. \n\n\u0026gt; There are verses clearly stating that suicide is a sin.\n\nYes, but what /u/Savemebarrry is pointing out, is while it is a sin, we don't necessarily know where they go. Are they committing a mortal sin? Were they under a spell of depression or a ton of other medical conditions that hampered their ability to think or comprehend reality, are they truly resentful and regret their actions from a moment of weakness? These are many of the questions surrounding Judas, who famously committed suicide, and Theologians debate to this day whether he is in Hell or Purgatory, or whether he had a choice, or whether it was even a Mortal Sin. \n\n\u0026gt;I won't take this as an offense, but don't you think I had a open heart? I was a true christian like everyone else. Saying that Paul had a mission to fulfill also shows that we don't have free will if everyone's fate is set in stone. Also God never spoke to me even though I trusted him like every other christian. If your argument is :\"You weren't a Christian from the beginning\", you are wrong.\n\nI agree that its a poor position to assume that you must've been a flawed Christian in some way, I'm a dedicated Catholic and while I've had many strange things happen to me that I've attributed to miracles I've never actually literally heard or have had a spiritual experience I can attribute to God, but that doesn't waver my personal belief, because you don't always need that kind of evidence to put two and two together, your concerns with Christianity seem to me to be primarily about the idea of predestination, or that we cannot have free choice if God is omni-everything, but I think I provided ample reasons above for why its still possible for God who exists without boundaries to give us a choice, to which he knows both outcomes, and actively does not get himself involved.

They certainly do in gatherings as you describe.\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to offend, and I'm really tempted to edit that, but I'm letting myself speak freely to be honest: Emotional highs are not the presence of the Spirit. They are the presence of dopamine and other biochemicals in your brain.\n\nConsider what the fruits of the Spirit are, friend: Love, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, etc etc. These things, I'm sure you've no doubt noticed, are what happen when you meet with your friends, share a meal, and talk. They are not what happens when you go to a Charismatic church service. Where there should be peace, there is rapidness. Where there should be patience, there is quick pace and movement. Where there should be gentleness, there is loud and triumph-of-the-will-like ~~speeches~~ sermons.\n\nThese things work while one is a youth for a while, but they cannot sustain the Holy Spirit.

God then creates woman and speaks of them becoming one flesh. When they sin, some of the punishment is physical. And when they are exiled God provides physical comfort in the form of animal skins.\n\nThe Old Testament comes to an end with the physical incarnation of the Son. He ministers to people's physical needs, not just their spiritual. His ministry leads up to a physical death, followed by a physical resurrection.\n\nThe New Testament ends with a vision of a physical new creation where we have physical bodies.\n\nSo the physical clearly matters to God.\n\nAnd see clearly matters. God speaks of the goodness of physical union in Genesis. He gives laws to his people concerning sex and marriage. Many problems with his people are associated with sexual immorality. Idolatry and wickedness in the surrounding nations is often indicated by their sexual immorality. Jesus taught about sex and marriage. The early church was taught about these subjects. The church is the bride of Christ. Revelation says that the sexually immoral will not enter the kingdom.\n\nI find it inconceivable that God would not care about 'our private bodily functions.'\n\n\u0026gt; The genders of the people you have sex with has no bearing on whether you are a good person or not, and therefore whether you are a good Christian.\n\nAgain, I don't see any justification for this as a Christian view.\n\nIn fact the last bit is particularly troubling. None of us are good. Christians aren't Christians because of their goodness. We depend utterly on the grace of Jesus. There are ways that Christians should live, having been saved, but they cannot become Christians through good works.\n\n\u0026gt; There are, of course, many Bible versus condemning gay sex (which we have all heard many times). My opinion is that these can be overlooked for the sake of the greater good both in our church and modern society. Thanks :)\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't understand this at all.

But if the Eastern Christians are correct, then that's not why Jesus was crucified at all. Rather, Jesus died as the only human being ever to live a life free of sin, having assumed man's sinful nature and overcome it. Therefore, when he suffered death (which is the wages of sin), he was able to defeat it, as it had no claim on him. All the language about God's wrath should be understood as being directed towards sin and death themselves, rather than at Jesus, the person; although Jesus' human flesh was the means (or, if you will, the medium or conduit) by which sin and death were dealt with.\n\nThe purpose of the Atonement, then, was to rescue mankind from sin and death by God himself suffering on our behalf that which he alone has the power to bear.

{"body":"So here's what I'm reading:\n\n- Increased allowance for \u0026gt;24 known carcinogens\n\n- Decreased allowance for 13 regulated chemicals\n\n- New regulation for 39 chemicals that are not presently regulated at all.\n\nSo if they had removed the increased allowance for the known carcinogens, this would have been great news for the environmental lobby, right? \n\nAre there any independent studies that have some idea as to the net effect? \n\nFor example, if the chemicals we're talking about are not especially prevalent anyway, the regulation is useless. Similarly, if the 24 carcinogens are extremely common and often push the allowable limit, but the 13 whose allowances were decreased never show up on tests anyway, then you know the 13 were thrown in just to get the ruling passed. If one of the 39 chemicals they're adding regulation for that was not previously regulated is causing that nasty algae bloom in the Indian River lagoon, this is terrific news. \n\nIt seems like there's not enough data here to determine if this really is a disaster or not.

{"body":"\u0026gt;A AR15 é relativamente curta se comparado com os fuzis da primeira e segunda guerra\n\nPor isso a definição de \"rifle de assalto\", a idéia era uma arma menor e mais leve que um fuzil tradicional, mas com o mesmo poder letal, apesar do alcance reduzido. Agradeça ao Tio Hitler pela idéia /s\n\n\u0026gt;mira não é ruim, no geral como carabina é ótima.\n\nSe você tem o luxo de estar parado e com a arma apoiada para atirar (pense sniper), sim. Se não, não muito a nem um pouco, dependendo da situação. O que não é problema para o uso militar para o qual foi desenhada, mas sem o tiro de rajada fica prejudicado. E estou falando de experiência, tive a oportunidade de testar esse rifle.\n\n\u0026gt;Eu sei que uma pistola é 1kg e pouco, dependendo do calibre e se o carregador for bifilar tem uma quantidade de munições próxima a de uma AR15, porém apoiar a AR15 no ombro já ajuda e muito no controle de recuo e um carregador de alta capacidade ajuda contra atacantes múltiplos.\n\nRecuo só vai ser problema em pistola de calibre alto, e mesmo assim já existem modelos que compensam o tranco. Além do mais, o problema maior na verdade é com a falta de familiaridade com a arma, a pessoa acaba \"flinching\" (não achei termo melhor) esperando o tranco antes mesmo dele acontecer, e erra o alvo. E pistolas também tem a opção de carregadores de alta capacidade.\n\nSobre cair em mãos erradas, não estava só me referindo a bandidos, mas também a crianças e pessoas com problemas mentais. E pra constar, balas de ponta oca são praticamente inexistentes para rifles.\n\n\u0026gt;Prefiro que a pessoa tenha a liberdade de escolher como se defender, se ela se sentir mais confortável com uma pistola, vá de pistola, se for melhor de fuzil, vá de fuzil.\n\nMas aí é que tá, não é uma mera questão de conforto pessoal, mas de eficiencia. Rifles foram feitos pra situações de combate onde o alvo costuma estar entre média e longa distância do atirador, enquanto situações de alto defesa costumam ter um agressor entre curta e média distância. Neste tipo de situação um revólver ou pistola é muitissimo mais eficiente em todos os sentidos, desde que você não esteja usando um calibre ridiculamente pequeno, claro. Eu não sou contra o porte de armas, mas sinceramente não vejo justificativa nenhuma pra um civil ter um rifle semi-automático como um AR-15.É overkill, e os contras não justificam os prós.\n\n\u0026gt;Aliás parou de entrar no IRC?\n\nMe arrastaram pro Telegram :D \n\n","score":"2","subreddit":"brasil"}

{"body":"Did I hear someone say \"armchair engineer\"??? Real Action Engineer (RAE) to the rescue!\n\nLet's first discuss lane widths. \"Standard\" straight travel lanes are about 11'. Wider lanes along curbs are typical to accommodate bus stops, freight trucks, and turns. Metro likes wider lanes so large buses have room to maneuver and turn without hitting curbs, planters, other vehicles, etc. That 15' turn lane at the top with the painted buffer, for example, is Metro's turn lane onto EB520 and will likely be used by route such as the 271 and 540. Anything on that diagram with a diamond or \"bus only\" will see bus traffic and possibly bus stops, so it'll be a bit wider. It's normal to use slightly wider lanes for vehicles turning to accommodate overhang and swing of vehicles like UPS and moving trucks (note how the two left turn lanes onto WB520 in the roadway's center widen from 12' on tangent to 14.5' and 15' in the curve). A 53' semi-truck (aka [WB-67](http://design.transportation.org/Documents/TurnRadii,GreenBook2004.pdf) PDF!) would have a hell of a time in here but it may fit assuming the poor driver gets creative . Engineers change \"standard\" things for reasons such as lane use, geometry, turning movements, turning types, ROW availability, and more. That's part of the job.\n\nSecondly is behavior. Wider lanes indeed make people drive faster, but on either side of this interchange lanes go back to being very narrow. 9.5' on that south end is about as narrow as we can make a lane. And there are \"refuge\" medians to break up two of the longer pedestrian crossings.\n\nThird is the number of lanes. While this thing appears enormous east-to-west, several of these lanes are for turn storage to move vehicles out-of-the-way to wait for left turns while other vehicle go straight or make other movements. This helps improve efficiency of an intersection, speeds up transit, and hopefully will unclog parts of it. Today, cars spill out of turn lanes and block the entire roadway; which is of no use to anyone. Additionally, I see many opportunities for \"no turn on red\" signage, which would help prevent cars turning during pedestrian phases.\n\nFourth, people biking and walking. A *significant* effort to create a network of paths and trails to ensure folks have a safe way to get around and can avoid the interchange. And if they cannot, there are wide sidewalks and a friggin nice covered lid to walk over. Check out this [beastly map](http://1p40p3gwj70rhpc423s8rzjaz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015_0116_SR520DesignReport_11x17-overviewmap.jpg). Specifically, the orange and yellow lines, points 16, 35, and 36, and SDOT's Greenways.\n\nFinally, I'd ask \"ok, what else are we to do?\" This is part of a $4 billion freeway project trying to right many wrongs with much more urban-friendly design than any other project around. We're adding a significant regional bike path, many walking paths, HOV lanes, restoration of the Aroboretum, and two very nice lids. I recommend taking a bus to the Evergreen Point Freeway Station to get a sample of what this thing will look like.\n\nEngineer out\n\n**drops mic**","score":"13","subreddit":"Seattle"}

The reduction of activation in the temporal regions could reflect deficits in orthographic representations and less reliance on semantic representations when processing the difficult conflicting pairs.\n\nTo paraphrase, children who have the classical 'dyslexic' problems with spelling and word-order comprehension were studied and researchers concluded there was a clear, definite and physical basis for their deficiency. This is not something which is addressable with more effort or synthetic phonics.\n\n\u0026gt;What is a rigorous definition of dyslexia? \n\nA neurocognitive deficit which results in impaired ability to recognise, comprehend and/or reproduce specific orthographic arrangement (i.e letters arranged into words or groups).\n\n\u0026gt;What would a falsifiable theory of dyslexia look like?\n\nThat there exists a neurological basis for the specific deficits associated with the condition identified as 'dyslexia' - i.e that there is some aberration of structure or function in the specific brain regions associated with processing, manipulating or reproducing written language.\n\nNote please that this does not preclude the existence of people who simply **are** just poorly educated or 'bad' at reading, spelling and grammar - it just establishes dyslexia as an *actual thing* with a physical cause.","score":"6","subreddit":"ukpolitics"}

{"body":"The thing that I don't think a lot of people get about the ending that made it so beautiful to me on an artistic level was that the whole game was about running away from your problems and the consequences. By ignoring the people in your life who need your love and attention the most and running away to make your own adventures, you're only part of the problem. The way that Firewatch ended didn't satisfy many gamers in part because it didn't validate their pre-existing ideas of what a game should be. Rather, it actively denied them what they wanted because it was making a statement about the way we spend our lives. No, the game isn't going to put you together with the other girl just because you want to see where it goes. No, the game isn't going to give you tons of chores to do and make you get lost in your own little fantasy. It's telling you to wake up and think about your own problems that you might be running away from. If Firewatch were a movie or animation of some kind it would be Oscar-worthy for sure IMO.\n\nI guess you could even consider it a bit of a meta-commentary on the nature of gaming itself if you really stretch it, huh? Sometimes we get so lost in games so willingly that we don't look out for our health or our family.\n\nI sincerely loved this game. It's everything Gone Home should have been IMO.

So why all the Denuvo hate?

{"body":"It is not going far to suggest removing dedicated servers were a part of geting you to move on. Are you aware call of duty started primarily as a pc game? If the series moved in a console centric direction, that is exactly what I'm talking about. Consoles have never had the fine tuned level of control available to pc. Peer-to-peer servers have a lot to do with availablilty of games and latency when playing. Dedicated servers were always the superior networking technology. Why would they downgrade the games networking capability? Activision wasn't hemorging money or something.\n\nI also never claimed people were locked out of playing multiplayer. As recently as this year I've still had the ability to (patiently) find games oon Mw2 (Ps3). What I'm getting at is unlike with true dedicated servers, there is no allure to stick around. Speaking of sticking around, why would PC players lose interest in the series, despite console versions selling so well? Because of the treatment of PC players. COD where it is now is not COD when we started. Yes, I stand by this was an intentional plan to group PC and console gamers to the same scheme. PC players wanted none of it.\n\n\u0026gt;but all they did was what made sense for consoles and paid no mind to how that would affect PC. \n\nHonestly, in the context of this conversation, how does that even make sense? What does that even mean? Op asked the question : \n\n\u0026gt;what do you honestly think about the direction of gaming is heading? \n\nand this is what I an awnsering. Pc gaming and console gaming exsisted in two different planes with two completely different levels of quailty. That changed with MW2. Console gaming remained largely the same before during and after. \n\n\u0026gt;On console there are still thousands of players for every cod,\n\nCan you show me a metric for this? I showed you how thousands of players still play COD. If you go launch Mw2 on PS3 it has always said 0/0 players (despite people actively playing.) Advanced warfare on PS4 doesn't even have a player count to the best of my knowledge.\n\nAnd on your last two points : \n\u0026gt;I know this might be hard to believe....but a lot of people genuinely like the yearly release schedule.\n\u0026gt;I hate all these loot boxes and stuff, but they really have nothing to do with your entire rant. \n\nIt's honestly like you didn't comprehend what I wrote up there. I never said people did not like the yearly format of COD releases. I said years ago this was not an acceptable practice. Only upon the release of advanced warfare did activision switch to a 3 year development cycle. Prior to that, every game had a 1 year development cycle; and it really showed. If games came out yearly and performed perfect, that's awesome. That was seldom the case, or have you forgotten the situation with assasins creed?\n\nFinally, the overwatch loot boxes had everything to do with my post! It had everything to do with OPs post! Again, refer to the OP title :\n\n\u0026gt;With the recent upsurge of CS:GO Lotto scandal, what do you honestly think about the direction of gaming is heading?\n\nTo reiterate that : What you do think about where gaming is headed, considering what happened with the CS:GO gambling situation? The entire overwatch customization relies completely on loot boxes! Everything from your avatar, to sprays, to skins to voice lines, and more! You can't earn in game currency except that you get it from the loot box, so you can't purchase specifically what you want. Maybe your luck was differnt, but I'm currently at level 27 with around 10 purchased loot boxes, I earned around 850 coins and not a single skin I wanted.\n\nThe overwatch base game is perfect, but lets not pretend the loot box system wasn't another way to make activision money. While you *can* wait and earn your loot boxes without a cent, we all know most people won't opt for that. They will opt to use real money to roll the dice a little more often for virtual items, to get around this artifical barrier to owning the items you want and that is what my post was about.\n\n\n\n","score":"2","subreddit":"pcgaming"}

Public shelters in a lot of cases are very different (depending on the wealth of the city) because they are receiving every stray dog in their area, and cat for that matter.  Especially if they are a no kill shelter, they are more focused on getting dogs out than putting them with the perfect person.  They can't afford to take multiple applications for each dog, pick out the best adopter, do a home check, etc.  I think a lot of public shelters do minimize behavioral problems, not by not mentioning them.  For example if a shelter knows a dog is leash reactive I'm sure they will mention it and say how the dog needs some training.  What they often don't say is how it could take years to overcome or the dog may never overcome it and it may just be a lifetime of managing the dog.  I'm not saying that every shelter is like this, but in my opinion, most people who come in to adopt a dog and sometimes even the staff actually aren't that knowledgeable about dogs, so they don't know how difficult it will be to manage or overcome certain behavioral problems.

{"body":"Hello. So I thought I would give you some perspective. First, like many people have said, what your vet did is not a good way to test for hip dysplasia. *do not do anything without x-rays (taken while your dog is under anesthesia* and, if possible, have those x-rays done by someone that is a board certified surgeon. \n\nNow, here's my experience.\n\nAt 5 months old my puppy, Lestrade (a GSD/Malamute mix I had gotten from my sister's dogs' unplanned litter) started running sideways. Her back always ended up drifting to the right, while her front legs stayed pointed at whatever she was running towards. She started having a little bit of difficulty standing up after playing and gradually wanted to spend less time at the dog park.\n\nI took her to the vet - thinking it was growing pains (she had shot up like a weed between 4 and 5 months). The vet did a physical check where he would stretch her right leg, move it, to see if it moved like her left leg. He also did x-rays. My dog had hip dysplasia. \n\nMy vet recommended I see the surgeon and my family told me to get a second opinion. I went to two vets and one surgeon before I accepted that yeah, Lestrade had hip dysplasia. At 6 months when the diagnosis was final - my pup weight 67 pounds. \n\nThe surgeon told me I had a couple options:\n1. The surgery where they take part of the thigh muscle and use it as a brace for the hip joint [TPO]. This wasn't recommended because the cut off for weight was 65 pounds. The surgeon told me that if I got this done she may still develop pain because she would not be 68 pounds forever. [cheaper]\n\n2. A total hip replacement where they gave her a new hip. She was dysplastic in both her hips - but only one was signing signs of pain. This was the best option, but had a 70% chance of her still being in pain when she was older. \n\n3. They kill the nerves in the hip and hope she's not in pain anymore - this was an experimental process that was not guaranteed to work and not guaranteed that they could do it. I immediately ignored this option.\n\nI had to decide which option was right for my dog. Lestrade was a very active pup and I wanted her to have the best choice. I opted for the Total Hip Replacement [THR]. The surgeon told me the best thing to do was to wait until she was a year old and her growth plates had fused. \n\nIn the six months between her diagnosis and her surgery she would have to be on Rimadyl, monitored for pain, and we would have to wait. \n\nFirst thing: Rimadyl, is not fucking cheap. That stuff is a damn racket. I signed up for their \"rewards\" which was pointless. if I remember correctly it came out to $2 a pill. \n\nFinally she had her surgery February 2015. She was in the veterinary hospital for a week. My surgeon's office was amazing and frequently sent me photos of my baby. Immediately after surgery the little brat tried to hop the walls between runs to meet friends and play. (At the time she was only a year). \n\nRecovery was not easy. She was unable to walk by her self for the first 6 weeks. I had a sling that wrapped around her hip and I had to lift her so she could walk. The problem I had was Lestrade didn't care that she had surgery. She wanted to go play with her friends and she had a TON of pent up energy. \n\nI am a masters student and was at the time. If I left - she had to be crated. I got her a *massive* crate which was known as her apartment. Separation anxiety, which was a problem before, is still an issue. I was essentially told \"yeah, you're just going to have a clingy dog\"\n\nAt the end of the first six weeks, the next 4-6 weeks she had to be monitored extremely carefully. She wasn't allowed to play, but she could go on short, controlled walks, on flat land. \n\nThere was NO running, jumping, playing, hills, stairs, hard wood floors, or tile for the first 6-8 weeks after surgery. \n\nShe had to be on four different types of medication. By the end of the three months post op, I had to open her mouth and shove them down her throat, because she learned to sniff them out. \n\nPost-recovery. My dog - as much as I hate to admit it - is not the same. Before her surgery she was afraid of nothing. She was cautious but she loved other dogs, she wasn't afraid of stores, or the vet. Post op - going to any store requires me to be on guard because the second she smells industrial strength cleaner her hackles go up and she's pulling at the end of her leash like she's pulling a sled. She gets very skittish and very nervous. Nothing can calm her down. \n\nShe is no longer in pain and she is happy and healthy. She's well loved and now will play until her heart explodes. \n\nI would 100% do it again if I had to.  However, it was time consuming. A year later and I'm *still* trying to pay off her surgery. The x-rays and medication cost roughly $3000 and the surgery itself was around $7500. Total a little over $10,000. It wiped my savings and put me into debt. \n\nIn December of 2015, I adopted a two year old GSD/Lab mix and named her Dantes. After about a month I noticed Dantes sat weird, and she had a hard time getting up and she's not as active as Lestrade. \n\nI haven't gotten x-rays done on her yet, because I'm afraid of the result. I am 90% sure my second dog also has hip dysplasia and the process will have to happen all over again. \n\nIt's not easy, it's a lot of time, a lot of money, and a ton of stress. Lestrade got out about three weeks into her recovery and broke EVERY. SINGLE. RULE. the surgeon gave me. She ran down a hill, was playing and running with other dogs, walked stairs, and jumped over a fence to do it. I called my surgeon at 8:30pm at his office. He interrupted his dinner at home to call me back and calm me down. \n\nI can't tell you whether you should return the dog or not. I struggled with that decision with Lestrade (Giving her up to a pound) and returning Dantes to the shelter where I got her. I couldn't do it. I knew that it is rare that a person would actually get a dog the surgery - and if the shelter disclosed the health issue it would be next to impossible for the dog to get adopted. \n\nI stress about money every day (I'm still in masters school), and my two dogs, despite being my biggest expense, have been the greatest things to happen in my life. \n\nI wish you the best of luck with your decision and hope this tale of what it's really like to go through with the surgery has helped. \n\nHere are some photos: http://imgur.com/a/Baf2Y\n\nHer first walk during recovery: https://www.instagram.com/p/09CX1mpIfT/?taken-by=starthrowerliz\n\na video of what the sling is like: https://www.instagram.com/p/zWHtHDJIV7/?taken-by=starthrowerliz","score":"1","subreddit":"dogs"}

{"body":"When it was just Odin, I thought I could never own multiple. I think it had to do a lot with him being my first dog. I always thought I could never like another dog as much as him! At the same time, what if I liked a new dog more? I just felt sad thinking of how another dog would change our dynamic, as silly as that sounds.\n\nI also felt sad because I knew it was only a matter of time before a second dog came into our lives. I work at a vet clinic and people come in all the time with stray dogs, or with their own pets they can't care for anymore just asking if there's anyone who could take them. That's how I got Odin! I also knew that I wanted the experience of raising a puppy, and that it might overlap with Odin being around. \n\nI took in Tyr due to exact scenario above - his family couldn't keep him. Partly because I'm made of mush, and also the fact that I'd been his only vet assistant for several years, I couldn't stand thinking of him being stuck in a shelter and took him in. I honestly did feel regretful at first, because I felt like I was damaging my friendship with Odin and also because I was, for the second time now, NOT in a position to take in a dog. But it's been 7 months now, and I've found that I actually really enjoy having two dogs around. They don't really interact much - Odin is actually not friendly with dogs, but over time can learn to trust and be comfortable with them - but I do see them sleeping together and feel like they've bonded. I like having two interesting personalities - they could not be any more different from each other! Having two very different dogs has really helped me figure out what I do and do not like in a dog, and I feel like I can better determine what kind of dog I want in the future when I'm looking to adopt a puppy.\n\nThe double vet bills (although low for me since I work there, lol), the double food costs, double training (I do still take them on individual walks in conjunction with their usual walk), the double EVERYTHING is of course NOT fun. But I think for me it's worth it. I think after they get a little older, I may be ready to pursue getting a puppy. The thought of 3 is not nearly as intimidating as 2, but I think it's because I know how much I overreacted the first time and now I have a much more positive outlook about multi-dog ownership, lol. I also know that my third dog will only be considered AT A DECENT POINT IN MY LIFE - I refuse to be a mush for the third time and have vowed off taking in any more dogs until I have the right time/space/money for them - so the idea of finally having a dog I give gold standard care to is very appealing, lol!

{"body":"The North American Indian Dog is a re-creation of what some people think the original native American dogs were like but are actually mostly, if not all based on non-NA breeds. \n\nLooks like he's mostly, if not all herding dog.  He's a an interesting dog color wise.  He's a sable.  Sables are born dark, lighten a lot between birth and 8 weeks and gradually darken again.   Sometimes these color changes are modest like in my sable smooth collie puppy but other times, like for your pup, it's more dramatic.  He will be a mahogany sable.  Sables (ignoring the clear ones) are red-tan with black tipped hairs.  The black tipped hairs, called shading, tend to be concentrated on the forehead (creating the widows peak mask - your dog's blaze obscures some of it), ears, tail and top and sides of the body. Mahogany sables have a lot more shading and deeper red tones in the base color. At 6 months, he's not at his final color yet and will be really pretty at maturity.\n\nSable is dominant over tan point - that is if a dog carries one copy of the sable gene and one copy of the tan point gene (called tri-factored in herding dogs), the dog will be sable.  Sometimes, not very common at all, a tri-factored sable will show \"ghosting\" of the tan points. Such as on your dog, even though he's a sable, is showing tan point patterning in his face - the areas clear of shading on his eyebrows and sides of his cheeks.\n\nIn herding breeds, sable is found in collies, shelties, corgis, tervs, Mals, briards, etc. For your dog, I'd consider it more likely, it came from a collie or Sheltie.\n\nHe has Irish White - the pattern of white markings (collar, blaze, front of chest, socks/stockings, belly and tail tip)  common in many herding breeds and found in in many other groups as well.\n\nIn his white, he's showing that he has the gene for ticking - the colored freckles.  In herding dogs, this gene is found in Australian Cattle Dogs (BTW, a totally different breed than the Australian  Shepherd, which despite the name is an American breed)  and Border Collies. \n\nAnyway, he could be a mix of ACD and/or Border collie with collie/Sheltie and possibly a smidgen of mystery mutt.\n\n","score":"3","subreddit":"dogs"}

They earned their UDs with low scores and were never in the ribbons unless all the other dogs DQed\n\n She got fed up with collies and their \"low work ethic\"  and got a Border Collie.  It did even worse than her roughs - slow and hesitant with a layer of neurotic behavior on top.  This lady was just a really sucky trainer - meager with the praise, humoress, and grimly persistent. \n\nOTOH, I know of a girl who started with a rescue pekingese - most definitely not a obedience breed - and not only put a CD and novice agility titles on her but did it with good scores and placements.  Her little peke was a happy worker and a delight to watch.  IIRC,  the girl next got a Border Collie  and did really well.\n\nOn paper the first lady had trained 3 UD collies and so one would have expected, with all that experience, that she would do great with a BC.

Of course balance isn't important on an anon site, but since everyone is relatively unknown to me and my reads on the population are biased and uncertain, I think there's a lot of value in playing more unexploitable.\n\nIn H3 I opened Q9s because the BB was short and most likely a fish. Normally I would only go down to QTs. I think on the turn villain will still call with most of his pocket pairs since I could be perceived to be barreling with a backdoor draw or just because the turn is a scare card. On the river I decided to triple barrel to get pocket pairs to fold and perhaps a weak Ace. Q9s is at the bottom of my range and it blocks AQ so if I was going to ever triple in that spot, it seems like the right hand for the job. Unfortunately villain raised on the river and he most likely had a set.\n\nEdit: Looked up H2. I only had 4 hands on villain but he had limped ealier. I think this means he'll have a wider continuing range on both the flop and turn, so the triple should succeed more often. Villain had AKo.","score":"0","subreddit":"poker"}

The bump and push into the wall were deemed unsportsmanlike by the race officials, but they didn't retroactively punish the teams (i.e. change the results of the race) because Laguna Seca was the last race of the season.

Coupled with an ability to repair damage to brains (assuming we don't create zombies by accident in the process O_O).  Even further genetic engineering, where we can select specific favourable traits and implement them. I.E. Implement changes to your head and body to reduce brain damage extensively. \n\nThat's not going to happen soon, so a bit of moot point, but at one point it won't be so, and the in between will have some gray areas we might have to hash out.\n\nLike for example if we could insure that we can healthy keep people hormones at the best levels for that particular body, and that it can only be done with a specialist and under full transparency and increased testing...would we object to that?

One of which was a barn burner against a guy who arguably beat JBJ (I say arguable because it was close and could have gone his way with different judges). In that fight you saw a DC that pushed the pace all 5 rounds and really embraced the championship rounds. This was a big reason why DC lost the first match--he gassed. \n\nAdditionally, JBJ seemed kind of slow and lacking in killer instinct, something that seems to only have heightened in DC after his two fights with Rumble and Gus.\n\nI'm not saying that I'd bet my house on DC or anything, but I could see DC going in there and pulling of an upset. Likewise, I could see DC bringing out the old JBJ and having a much more hotly contested fight.

Au pire il en fait une \"peine plancher\" en quelque sorte, mais les peines planchers étaient conformes à la constitution (voir sa décision n° 2007-554 DC du 9 août 2007), il suffit juste de rajouter un alinéa permettant l'individualisation, ce qui a été fait si tu lis l'article en entier : *\"L’amendement présenté visait \"à rendre obligatoire la peine complémentaire d’inégibilité\" en cas de condamnation pour violences. Obligatoire, \"mais pas automatique\", car il prévoyait aussi de laisser au juge la possibilité de ne pas prononcer l’inégibilité.\"*\n\nMais il n'y a pas que via une procédure judiciaire que cela peut être appliqué, cela pouvait aussi passer par une procédure administrative en empêchant toute personne ayant été condamnée pour des faits de violences sexuelles de déposer candidature.\n\n\nEDIT : D'ailleurs au regard du texte et de sa date d'adoption, je suis même pas sûr que l'amendement faisant grief a été rejeté en commission.","score":"15","subreddit":"france"}
{"body":"Je vais juste profiter de ce post pour déballer un peu mon sac, car je me suis retrouvé vaguement dans la même situation, sauf que moi je suis le mec et j'ai environ 10 ans de moins. \nC'était il y a 3 ans, j'avais rencontré cette nana par hasard en colocation chez l'habitant, on a vite compris qu'on avait pas mal de points en commun tq l'âge, nouveaux dans la région, études industrielles en alternance, aînés de famille recomposés avec des parents \"jeunes\" (j'insiste sur ce détail) rajoutez à ça une attirance physique réciproque, deux caractères peut être complémentaires (elle une fonceuse moi un peu plus calculateur) mais surtout 15cm de cloison pour séparer nos chambres respectives, je ne vous fais pas de dessin sur la suite des évènements.. Moi je me suis très vite (trop vite) empressé, plus j'apprenais à la connaître plus ça m'apparaissait évident que je n'en retrouverai pas une pareille. Ça a été si rapide que 3 mois plus tard on a louer une maisonnette en campagne et je nous ai pris un p'tit chiot. Enfin non la maisonnette était la conséquence du chiot (c'est pas passé avec les autres colloques). Engueulades, réconciliations en bonne et due forme, moto boulot dodo, je vivais enfin une relation à 100km/h je me sentais vivant. Bizarrement on aspirait à beaucoup d'ambitions communes avec toujours le besoin de se dire que la relation pourrait s'arrêter  du jour au lendemain. On s'aimait à notre façon un peu bancal, sans trop se poser de questions et c'était tant mieux. Un plus tard je la demande en fiançailles, elle me dis oui et on rigole du fait qu'on ne sait pas qui est le plus sérieux des deux. Je ne sais plus trop quand et comment  la question d'un enfant avait été abordé mais je lui avoue qu'avec elle ça ne poserait pas de soucis, l'ayant vu avec des enfants elle s'est très bien s'y prendre. Elle, était sûre que le résultat d'une éducation commune donnerai un drôle avec foutu caractère étant donné qu'actuelement le maître dans la maison c'était le chien lol. Cela dit, elle ajouta ensuite que même \"adopter un petit brésilien\" si c'était avec moi ça passe. Un soir, quelques semaines après la promesse de mariage, on rentrai des courses. Dans la voiture elle me dit avoir des nausées, je lui dis alors que c'est malin d'avoir fait une razzia rayon fruit de mer, elle qui d'habitude est économe et n'achète que des trucs facile à digérer. Elle ajoute être ennuyée car cela fait quelques jours que ça persiste. Aussitôt dans ma tête je fais le rapprochement “fruit de mer peut être mais fruit quand même, son envie spontanée additionnée à des nausées, attends.. Elle est p'tet en cloque là?!\" je lui fait part de ma pensée, elle rie me rappelant qu'elle a un stérilet dans le bas du ventre. Ça tombe bien y'a une pharmacie dans 200 mètres je vais  pouvoir en avoir le coeur net. Elle rouspéte mais n'insiste pas à me déposer devant. Retour à la maison, les courses sont rangée elle file aux WC. Silence radio. Je me demande un truc du genre qu'est-ce qu'on va bien pouvoir manger ce soir quant elle en ressort. Elle sourit mais à les larmes aux yeux, et de sa main tremblante me tend le \"thermomètre\". J'ai pas la notice mais je comprends sans comprendre. Je pige que j'ai pas de bol, la médecine ne m'avait pas encore fait faux bond. Je pige surtout que je suis sortie de la pharmacie y'a 10minutes et que j'ai rien anticipé, j'étais assis c'est déjà ça. Enfin, je comprends dans son regard qu'il faut que je dise quelque chose. \"ça craint un peu là, nan?\" Mauvaise pioche. Je regrette déjà ma réaction. Elle craque et s'isole dans la chambre. Franchement je ne sais plus ce qu'il s'est passé ensuite dans la soirée, même pas si on a mangé les bulots. On a décidé d'aller chez le gynéco quelques jours après pour être sûr. Après tout y'avais casiment peu de chance que ça arrive, il y en a tout aussi peu que le test se gourre. Le raisonnement tient pas la route, on le sait très bien. Notre relation prend une nouvelle tournure, c'est tendu. On essaie de faire comme si de rien n'était mais c'est impossible. Le gynéco en rajoute une couche, il reste deux jours, avec la semaine de délai obligatoire pour l'igv médicamenteuse, sinon faudra passer sur le billaud. Putin, a deux jours près la décision aurait été plus facile à prendre. Vous connaissez ce passage de matrix où morpheus propose la pilule bleue ou la pilule rouge à néo, j'adore ce passage, sauf que c'est du cinoche. On était chez Quick quand on s'est décidé, hors de question d'aller chez les parents ce week-end. Enfaite personne n'a vraiment pris position, ça sera la pilule et puis c'est tout. La magie à disparue à force de réfléchir. Encore 6 jours d'attente, cette semaine elle est au boulot et moi je suis en cours. Elle sera dans le rush elle pensera à autre chose, moi je suis bloqué sur ma chaise et mes camarades  m'exaspèrent. J'ai envie de me confier mais leur problèmes de jeux vidéo me semble insignifiant, je leur parle jamais de toute façon. Les profs? Et puis quoi encore, je ne vais pas me mettre à raconter ma life à n'importe qui. Ça y est on dimanche, j'hésite encore à aller à mon match de rugby, mais vu qu'elle insiste tellement pour que j'aille me défouler, j'y vais. Comme un abruti. Je suis dans le bus, pas franchement envie de faire le con avec les autres. Un petit message pour lui dire de venir nous rejoindre, et qu'on verra ça après. J'attends sa réponse mais enfaite j'ai pas envie qu'elle y aille dans cet hôpital. Échauffement terminé je file voir mon téléphone: \"ba c'est fait, ils m'ont déjà laissé sortir, je suis à la maison mais je saigne beaucoup. Joue bien bisous.\"  j'ai joué comme une merde, on a gagné, j'ai envie de chialer.\nC'était le pire dimanche de toute ma vie, mais de la gnognotte à côté du sien, elle a perdu beaucoup plus de sang que les 30 mecs sur le terrain. \nLes jours se sont passés, son corps et sa tête ont eu du mal à s'en remettre. Pour nous deux, c'était finit sans l'être vraiment. On a passé un an ensemble à essayer de retrouver comment on s'aimait, avant de bifurquer chacun de son côté. Pour moi rien n'avait changé, pour elle on était plus crédible. Elle a réussi tout ce qu'elle a entrepris depuis, à se remettre en couple aussi.

{"body":"Il y a pas de justice des cols blancs, ou alors tu vas m'apprendre qu'en France on sélectionne le juge en fonction de ta catégorie socioprofessionnelle.\n\nEn revanche il y a une forme particulière de délinquance qui est la délinquance dite \"en col blanc\". Ce sont en général les activités financières illégales que l'on vise par là.\n\nLe problème de la délinquance en col blanc et de son impunité vient de deux phénomènes : l'évasion fiscale et la fraude fiscale. Ces phénomènes sont le plus souvent confondus, à tort, puisqu'en réalité l'évasion fiscale n'est pas illégale et n'est donc pas de la délinquance, même si elle est moralement réprimée. La fraude fiscale elle pose un double problème qui est globalement lié à la façon dont elle est gérée.\n\nLa fraude fiscale d'une part, notamment lorsqu'elle passe par des pays différents, est difficile à gérer par un Etat seul, qui ne peut imposer a un autre Etat qui fait son pain sur l'exil fiscal frauduleux, une autre législation. C'est le principe de souveraineté des Etats. D'autre part, même les organisations internationales tels qu'Interpol qui luttent contre la criminalité financière ont énormément de mal à dépatouiller des réseaux complexes, au moins autant que les réseaux de trafics de drogues, d'armes, d'être humains. L'autre problème et j'ai un chargé de TD qui a fait sa thèse la dessus en prenant l'exemple des pays d'Afrique, c'est que le principal lésé est l'Etat. Lorsque Monsieur Truc fait un montage fiscal illicite pour ne pas payer d'impôt, c'est l'Etat qui est lésé, ce n'est pas toi et moi, c'est l'Etat. C'est une argumentation de mauvaise foi que de dire que ce sont les citoyens qui sont lésés pour plein de raisons différentes (non affectation des recettes aux dépenses, principe de dissociation de la somme des intérêts particuliers et de l'intérêt général). Là ou le verrou de bercy entre en jeu, c'est qu'il permet d'obtenir une rédemption volontaire des fraudeurs, qui sont plus à même de vouloir se remettre dans le droit chemin si on leur fait un peu peur, plutôt que de se lancer dans une procédure complexe qui n'aboutira pas. Ce système du verrou de Bercy existe dans d'autres Etats que la France et en France pour d'autres domaines, notamment la comptabilité publique. Encore une fois l'Etat veut garder la main puisque c'est lui qui est lésé et non l'ordre public qui serait troublé. C'est aussi en rapport avec une vision particulière du Droit en général qui veut que la menace est plus forte que l'exécution et à laquelle j'adhère globalement. Mais c'est à débattre. Mais là encore, rien à voir avec les juges en soit.\n\nEDIT : tu as modifié ton commentaire avant que j'ai terminé.\n\nD'une part, l'existence de quartiers \"VIP\" dans les prisons (et non pas une prison VIP) est liée à des raisons de sécurité la plupart du temps et parce qu'on ne veut pas mélanger certains détenus avec d'autres détenus. D'autre part l'appellation quartier VIP est assez fallacieuse, ils sont d'un confort et d'un équipement tout relatif et correspondent le plus souvent à l'état des prisons Françaises. D'autre part, cela donnent l'impression que seuls des personnalités riches ou protégés par le pouvoir s'y sont fait incarcéré. C'est en partie vrai, parce que on ne veut pas mélanger des détenus, en prisons pour de longues peines, avec des personnalités politiques pour éviter non seulement du trafic d'influence dans un sens mais aussi de la violence dans l'autre, car certains détenus n'hésiteraient absolument pas à faire passer un sale quart d'heure a un \"bourge\" comme FleurduPays les appellent. C'est en partie faux parce que des prisonniers très célèbres ont été placés dans ces quartiers parce qu'on veut éviter le contact entre eux et les autres détenus, pour d'autres raisons. Par exemple Mesrine, Petiot, Carlos (le terroriste pas le chanteur) et même le type qui avait intenté l'assassinat contre De Gaulle (et inutile de te dire que connaissant De Gaulle, il aurait pas voulu que ce type ait le moindre traitement de faveur). C'est aussi pour éviter certains risques d'évasion.\n\nEDIT second :\n\nEt sur le renversement de la charge de la preuve. Non seulement ta phrase veut rien dire mais le plus souvent c'est pour les cas où la preuve serait trop lourde ou impossible à rapporter ou pour favoriser la victime justement. Exemple, en justice administrative, que je maîtrise mieux, le juge peut renverser la charge de la preuve pour favoriser le demandeur en général qui agit contre l'Etat. En effet, en matière d'actes administratifs illégaux, plutôt que de laisser peser la charge de démontrer l'illégalité sur un justiciable, qui n'a parfois pas d'avocat et qui se retrouve dans une position déséquilibrée, le juge peut demander à l'Administration de prouver que son acte est légal.","score":"13","subreddit":"france"}

I planted a row of them behind my garage one year, where there's 4 feet between the back of the garage and the chainlink fence along the alley, and by the end of the summer the tithonia was an 8 foot tall jungle and was leaning so far over the fence that I couldn't access the garbage cans if I kept them on that side of the back fence on the alley, and we couldn't get under there to weedwhack the alley verge.\n\nSo I finally had to get my husband to stand in front of this humongous mass of foliage and hold it back physically while I scooted a big chunk of my 6 foot tall concrete reinforcing wire that I use to make tomato cages in front of it, inching it along while he held back more chunks of jungle, and then we propped some extra fence posts in front of the wire to try and brace the whole mess back against the garage wall.\n\nIt was a chore.

I'm not understanding why you want them in the front yard and why you want them screened.  I'd treat your poppies as any other garden vegetable crop, since you're wanting to keep them past their \"best by\" date, and put them in the back yard.

Once you spend time in the IS350 doing something other than WOT hooning you begin to feel that it's just your average run of the mill V6 with a little oomph thrown in. The 2GR is a bit more torquey down low while the VQ is a bit like a high revving Honda engine where you have to spin it to get power.\n\nYou could dress up the VQ to be as smooth as the V6 in the Avalon is, it's just not something Nissan took as the biggest priority. The VQ35HR/37HR is a well balanced engine, though. It reliably revs to 7.5k RPM stock and 8.5k RPM with a tune. It also is fairly stout and responds to FI well. That engine would be amazing in a car that is under 2800lbs.\n\nWithout FI, the VQ37/2GR/J37 are top of the line as far as NA V6 engines go. I'm talking about daily driver, reliable and low maintenance platforms. They're obviously no match for German FI 6s but they're as good as a sub 4L NA V6 gets. Any V6 that's better than those 3 has a blower strapped to it. I mean, show me a stock NA V6 that can even sneeze at the powerband of Turbo 6. It can't be done in the NA form, afaik. If there is technology to do it, it's not worth the trouble most likely.\n\nThere are several shorter ratio differentials available for the 370Z that would really wake the car up. He'd sacrifice fuel economy but he'd run through gears considerably faster by allowing the torque band to be more pronounced through each gear.

But the record sheet says the *exact opposite*.  The only company he ever took public (that is, he collected other people's money and promised to take good care of it and increased the worth of their shares), DJT, he ran into ground in a spectacular fashion.  Shareholders lost pretty much everything, while the only person profiting massively was the CEO who got massive bonuses.   I look at such things as part of why I am so overpaid, and nowadays, such a CEO would have some  chance to share a cell with Bernie Madoff.  But in the 80s he just walked away richer than ever while having gambled away other people's money.  \n\nThere is some opinion in the above, but only in the last two sentences, and that opinion is coming from a source that, for some reason, some people pay good money to tap.  But regardless, everything else is simple fact.  \n\nJust assume you were to invest your life savings.  And this guy applies for the job.  And then you take a good, long look at what he did to other people's money -- when he loaned it and promised to pay it back (he did not, that's what a bankruptcy is, breaking your promise on paying back borrowed money), when he collected it and promised it would be invested so you would benefit greatly (you lost everything you entrusted to him -- that is what running a public company into the ground means).  \n\nWould you think that this guy will suddenly be on Team You, because he *promises* to be?  Why?  He broke promises, a lot (and these are very hard, direct and specific promises), and he *boasts* about taking people's money, promising to pay them back, not doing it, and having gotten richer in the progress.  \n\nWhy would he suddenly get your back?  Why would he be interested in you beyond your vote?  Would you trust him, with his actual business record on how he handles other people's money, with your financial future?  \n\nSo then, why entrust him with your children's general future?  \n\nI would, on both questions, be not really happy about either candidate.

{"body":"Hey, I read this this morning and meant to respond. I wanted to say that my husband and I went though a similar thing more than once: me being a stay at home mom and wanting to visit my family during times when he couldn't be there. So, I guess I'm saying, I get where you're coming from, but also where she is coming from.\n\n\nI know its hard to be away from your baby for a few days, especially when they are itty bitty. Not only do you miss them, but maybe you feel a little out of control? I don't mean that you're a control freak, but that if something goes wrong, you're not there to help. Anyways, that's how my husband said it made him feel. I remember telling him I felt like he was trying to control me, and feeling like I was no longer free to make my own choices felt suffocating.\n\n\nI think though, that if you look at the bigger picture, you'll see that it will do you both a lot of good if you support her visiting her family, even if you can't make it too. I know it sucks but its only a few days, and it will do her so much good. Its really isolating and lonely being at home with a little baby, and if it makes her happy, it will be good for everyone and hopefully mitigate a blow-up down the road from pent up emotions.\n\n\nSo, no, I don't think you're overreacting, but I think you should choose your battle here and support her going. Let her get a change of scenery and clear her head. It will not only be good for her mentally, but make her a better parent if she isn't holding onto resentment towards you and the baby. Tell her you love her, and will miss them both, but try and understand her point of view. I'm sure you work really hard, and I know working all the time and being a parent isn't a walk in the park, but neither is being the stay at home parent...It's just a different sort of stress and pressure. Home life isn't very mentally stimulating, at least for the first several months. I don't know your guys' situation or life obviously, but try looking at how much each of your lives have changed since having a child. Before the baby, my husband went to work every day, then came home and hung out with me. Sometimes we went and did stuff together. After baby, my husband still went to work every day (maybe a little more tired than before), then came home and hung out with us. Its a big change but overall, a similar routine of getting out and affecting something other than your immediate self and home. For me...I went from having a job, making my own money, hanging out with friends and coworkers to staying at home with a baby. Everything was different, turned upside down, and it took me awhile (6 months or so?) to start adjusting to this new normal. It made me a little bitter that my husband got to keep going on, business as usual, while everything got shook up for me (which, admittedly, is what I wanted but it was certainly not how I expected it to be).\n\n\nAnyways, good luck and I hope you guys come to a compromise that works for both of you.","score":"1","subreddit":"Parenting"}

Our conversations have dragged on this long and the questions become repetitive because you keep on sidestepping. As his student of 15+ years you should be able to explain how his method works, and perhaps do so with enthusiasm if you have confidence in it, but it seems like you don't.\n\nI don't care about the karmamudra issue either. Whether he has vows or not only affects him and those who received monastic vows from him. But I do find it disconcerting that he named his center after JTK despite not being orthodox Gelug. I sure hope people don't get misled by the orthodox branding and believe his 4 step method is taught at Tibetan monasteries, or receive ordination at DM only to get married off. Again his unorthodox conduct is just a side issue. The main issue is what he's marketing  to 15000+ people/year.\n\n\u0026gt; any teaching on karma is skillful means anyway\n\nAFAIK, the Buddha and Nagarjuna taught the workings of karma as actual facts of life. Again, I'd appreciate direct quotes from JTK, not what GMR taught you. Even if karma is just a modeling of how things actually work, please explain how GMR's model functions. It seems unworkable or extremely unlikely to work. Doctrines aside, it didn't work in real life for him and 7 of his best students. Explain that.\n\nI think earlier you implied that the teaching on karma is a model that the Buddha borrows, that's not true.\n\n\u0026gt; How do you know whether I read the article? \n\nBy your responses, one was (paraphrase) \"If they actually have such view, why don't they say so publicly on their websites?\" The article quotes what Buddhist teachers teach about karma, all the quotes were linked to their books or websites. No one was talking about GMR, bud.\n\nI actually provided links to 2 articles: one on the practice of generosity and one on the traditional teaching of karma. The karma article also covers generosity, so essentially you'd just need to read this one article. \n\n\u0026gt; will automatically be convinced that you are right? That's not how it works!\n\nWhat makes you think I have such expectation? I don't.\n\n\u0026gt; Time spent criticizing teachers you disagree with is time you don't have to find a teacher you do agree with and practice what you are taught.\n\nMy opinions don't matter, it's the tradition that his teaching and conduct disagree with. Questioning a teaching or conduct is criticizing? Daniel Ingram is a self-proclaimed Arahat, but you don't see me question his teaching or conduct, do you? AFAIK, his teaching is kosher and he doesn't bang his students or lie to his audience. That's not too much to expect from a teacher, is it? There are plenty of such teachers out there, I don't know where you got the idea that I don't have teachers or practices.\n\nAnyway, I'd like to spend most of my Reddit time browsing cat pics so please either school me on the working of his karma model, or admit that you have no idea how it could possibly work, why he guarantees 100% success when it didn't work in real life, etc.","score":"1","subreddit":"Buddhism"}

{"body":"**I really just want to do the same as what everyone else does, where would I start out if I wanted to become a Buddha?** \n\nBuddha or Buddhist? You can become a Buddha (in later lifetimes) if that's your goal, but I'm going to assume you mean buddhist. You become a buddhist by taking refuge in the tripple gem. The triple gem includes\n\n\n1. The Buddha\n\n2. The Dhamma (The teachings of the Buddha(Pali Canon, if you're theravada))\n\n3.The Sangha (The global community of all monks)\n\nYou can say it either out loud or make a silent intention, either in public or in your room, alone. If you say it out loud, just say something like \"I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the Dhamma, I take refuge in the sangha, I take refuge in the triple gem.\"\n\nFrom there, I would recommend at least 10 minutes of meditation, twice a day (morning \u0026amp; evening would be optimal). If you plan on using the mahasi method, which I linked a booklet to in the previous thread, this would mean 5 minutes walking and 5 minutes sitting in the morning, and then 5 minutes walking, 5 minutes sitting in the evening. The only other method I would recommend is the method described in detail in [Mindfulness in Plain English](http://ftp.budaedu.org/ebooks/pdf/EN036.pdf), in which case you'd just be doing 10 minutes sitting, twice a day.\n\nI'd also recommend reading a bit maybe 5-10 minutes twice a day. It's important that you understand that it's more important to get time in every day (dhamma and meditation) than to practice both for extended periods. \n\nAs your concentration improves, increase your time spent in meditation. For the first 2 months, I'd try to increase your meditation time 2 minutes a week. After that it's really up to you. The goal is to eventually be able to meditate at least 1 hour a day. If you can do more than that, do it, but that's what you're working towards for now.\n\n*EDIT: Memorize the 7 factors of enlightenment, the eightfold noble path, 4 foundations of mindfulness, and the 5 hindrances.*\n\n**What is the normal thing for most people to do? I want it to be official.**\n\nLook to see if there's a monastary anywhere near you. If there is, call them and tell them you'd like to participate in a taking refuge ceremony. If not, you can still do it by yourself and it would be just as official.\n\n**I have one last silly questions. Do Buddhists have a certain diet that they follow?

People that are against it, say that buying it promotes the killing of it...which does happen to be true, but in my opinion, that doesn't make you guilty of breaking the killing precept. I would just recommend becoming less picky with your diet. Don't choose foods because you are lusting for them or are desiring the taste. Eat what is good for you and keeps you alive.

{"body":"Yeah, and I love that if you ever feel like starting over, you can just pick up a new weapon and you're good to go.  \n\nI'm more of a casual Tales player, since I've only played a select few titles. The ones I've completed are all ones I've liked though, so I would probably recommend them. Tales of Symphonia was originally on GC which was then ported to PS2, which was then ported to PS3, which was then ported to Steam. Symphonia was my entry to the series, and while I do still like it, I have found the cutscenes to be a bit too slow if you want to mash through them.  \n\nTales of the Abyss is another great title, originally for PS2, and ported to the 3DS. I personally enjoyed Abyss more than Symphonia and Legendia, because I enjoyed the gameplay and story more(ToS requires doing a slight pause to swap between which enemies to focus on in the battlefield;TotA has free-roam on the battlefield, removing the two-dimensional fighting-game-esque plane).  \n\nTales of Legendia is a bit of an older title, also for PS2. All the fighting was on the 2D fighting-game-esque plane, but unlike ToS, each monster didn't have their own plane(i.e. eagle monster has plane 1, wolf monster has plane 2, rabbit monster has plane 3). This was also before the series removed random encounters while walking(this became visible generic monsters in the game world later), but I still very much enjoyed the game.  \n\nThe only other game in the series I have played is Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World for Wii and ported to PS3. I wouldn't say the game is necessarily bad, but it's not as good as ToS or TotA. Being a later entry, it has some of the upgrades that came along with Abyss(like approaching the generic overworld monster from behind to get a battle advantage), but also introduces a very \"Pokemon\" bit. You find and tame monsters and evolve and level them. I had a monster once get so overpowered that fights would end immediately as they began because it would obliterate everything on screen.  \n\nAs an aside, I played through XC3D earlier this year, and I loved it. The gameplay can seem a bit odd at first, but it plays very similarly to MMOs with its real-time cooldown-based combat. The story is pretty solid as well. I also played XCX after loving XC3D, and can say it improved the battle system, while the story took a bit of impact. But I enjoyed many many more hours playing XCX because the game doesn't end when the story does, you can just keep going and *try* to get all the achievements. I say try because there is *literally* like 800.","score":"3","subreddit":"nintendo"}

{"body":"Part of my reasoning for having Stark was that he played a key role in pre-OMD Spidey, and also because he, Strange, and Reed are the in-universe explanation for the secret identity retcon. Also, he has a connection to MJ now that he's her boss.\n\nAs for Mephisto gloating, I get what you're saying. I think it's a little clunky myself, and I'm still trying to nail down how I'd want to execute it. I do think Mephisto should show some pride, thinking that he's \"won\" once one of them is dead and unable to reconcile with the other.\n\nHmmm now that I think about it, in the fateful OMD issue, Mephisto says that he left a part of Peter and MJ's souls aware of the change, so that he could always enjoy their suffering, so maybe the shock of MJ's death causes that part of Peter to reassert itself? That would definitely show how Mephisto's pride was his downfall.","score":"3","subreddit":"comicbooks"}

I feel like all the people that take over mantles in Marvel save for falcon just come out of left field and feels disjointed.\n\n- Marvel has more \"down to earth\" characters while DC seems to have the gods amongst men approach and while I don't see either as being better or worse I can see how lots of people can \"relate\" to the x-men,spider-man over someone like Superman. Personally I think DC has more..inspirational stories where they try to show us something to strive towards, where as I feel Marvel likes to shine a harsher light and show us our flaws.\n\n- Marvel is doing a bit better on the funny side, Deadpool and Spider-gwen being a bit better than DC books like Bizzaro (which is very underrated)\n\n- I can't afford to keep up with Marvel events, not everything has to be a god damn whole universe crisis that spans every single god damn book they put out.

{"body":"I agree that using those terms can be more inflammatory than useful. However, I also find distancing language to be a **huge** physiological barrier to being empathetic towards animals. \n\nThere's a difference between using a term to gross out people and using a term for accurate reflection. \n\nFor instance: I don't ever refer to animals as things/objects (no \"it\" language) I always say \"someone\", \"who\", \"him\", \"her\", \"them\" and \"they\". \n\nI also wont use the terms which are distancing language. I say \"cow's milk\" instead of just \"milk\" or if the situation calls for it I'll also use the term \"animal lactation\" as in \"I don't drink lactation from any animal\" if I need to clarify that it's not just cow's milk which I avoid. I replace \"meat\" with \"animal\", \"dead animal\" or when appropriate \"carcass\". The different terms such as \"pork\", \"bacon\", \"wings\", \"veal\"  and \"beef\" are replaced with \"pig\", \"chicken\" and \"cow\". Instead of \"leather\" I say \"animal skin\". I specify \"eggs\" as \"chicken's eggs\".\n\nAnd yes, I use very pointed language when I speak about how animal products are used. If someone asks me \"Don't you miss steak?\" they get responses like \"No, I don't eat cows.

If implemented, this decision would violate an agreement with the EU on the free movement of people. As a result of the stand-off, negotiations with the EU about a deal on financial services have been shelved.\n\n\u0026gt;The Swiss bankers’ association first suggested launching a “F4” financial centres group in 2012. “It is now time to relaunch the initiative,” Mr Odier said.\n\n\u0026gt;The UK’s planned break with the EU would make an alliance with Switzerland more attractive to London, he said, adding that it would also be welcomed by the EU which would rely heavily on the two financial centres to finance future economic growth.\n\n\u0026gt;“Together, they [the UK and Switzerland] would be even more important in contributing to the development of a European capital market and financing European industry than they were separately before. That is where I see a huge and interesting area of collaboration,” Mr Odier said.\n\n\u0026gt;Under his proposals, a “F4” group would co-ordinate positions on global financial regulation and access to the EU market. The aim would be to establish international standards, to avoid the duplication of efforts, to pool expertise and to speed up dealmaking.\n\n\u0026gt;The UK vote has led to turmoil in European financial markets, but Swiss bankers believe they could benefit as investors seek havens to invest their money.\n\n\u0026gt;“Switzerland’s financial centre … generally benefits from any type of uncertainty — with the caveat that an unstable relationship between the UK and Europe and an unstable Europe are not beneficial for neighbouring financial centres,” Mr Odier said.\n\n\u0026gt;Uncertainly about Switzerland’s future relationship with the EU was a “big unresolved challenge”, he added.","score":"7","subreddit":"unitedkingdom"}

Getting SSRIs from a GP is like getting advice on pet health care from a cashier at a pet shop. A psychologist/psychiatrist explore the issues and decide what's best. Sometimes they combo it with therapy so that the root of the problem can be dealt with.\n\nSSRIs are a **temporary solution** and I cannot stress this enough. Don't just take SSRIs and expect everything to solve itself, you'll need follow up appointments with a therapist for monitoring purposes and see how it goes as well as therapy, and this is very important to keep in mind.\n\nI'm speaking from my own experience somewhat, I've had a horrible run with depression and I felt like I'm dying, I asked my GP to prescribe SSRIs. First I got citalopram that was OK mostly but it killed all my sex drive, and being 22 at the time, living with my fiance, things have gotten complicated because of it. When I called the GP about it and asked if he could change it to something else, his reaction was chilling. He said he doesnt really know much about antidepressants and that he could just prescribe another SSRI and see if it works. The next one he prescribed was even worse, I had to come off it slowly, and since I was not on any sort of therapy in the meanwhile, I was back at 0 again and it was much harder after, than before the SSRIs and my sex drive has been dead every since (over a year now).

I'm not criticizing any parenting skills because I'm not there but that's what it could be.\n\nI know that feeling all too well, being sad for your baby.

So at least $1 to $3 per bottle just for oak. Also a heck of a lot more cellar room for aging vs. large temperature controlled steel tanks and a lot more labor cleaning, filling, racking, monitoring, and just moving those barrels. While for a $30-50 wine, the oak costs are kept and in check and the production volume is lower. Meiomi makes ~8-12m bottles (500k-800k cases estimate range)  They'd need 25k to 40k barrels.","score":"1","subreddit":"wine"}

If they're a decent place, they should offer low-income clients services on a sliding scale. If not, switch to one that does, such as a community health clinic. These sorts of places have additional benefits that their doctors are used to seeing clients in situations like yours, so they know how to navigate medical insurance problems, offer emergency/samples of supplies and medications to keep you going, and some places even have social workers to help access other community benefits like financial/employment/etc help. \n\nIf you're feeling mentally unwell as well, this can help urge your provider to get you some help as well. I found out my diagnosis right in the middle of a mental health crisis that nearly killed me, so, they were quick to get me the help I needed and recognized I wasn't in the shape to do everything by myself. Nothing to play around with, especially if you're the only provider for your family (sounds like it, if both your sister and your mother are having problems making ends meet?).  \n\nFood: Food banks tend not to care what clients they serve, get food other than PB\u0026amp;J and fast food from there ASAP. Hopefully they'll be able to offer you substitutions/etc for a low carb diet, otherwise you might have to give the junk carby food to your family. \n\nIf you haven't applied for food stamps, do that. Unemployment (regardless of UI granted or not) and/or (near) homelessness can be enough to bump a previously filed application into approval regardless of finances, if the case manager is notified of the change in circumstances. \n\nOtherwise: Eggs are cheap, canned tuna (check sodium on label), cheap produce like spinach, cabbage, frozen vegs, cheap per pound protein like chicken. If you really must eat fast food and PB\u0026amp;J, avoid fries and the bread, avoid peanut butter which has added sugars/high fructose corn syrup (read label), there are sugar-free or \"reduced sugar\" varieties of jam available in the US as well (Welch's or Smuckers are two such brands that have both varieties, they will be slightly more than the house/dollar store brands though.).\n\nEmployment: I'm sure you're applying everywhere you can still, keep that up! If your skills or a gap is what is keeping you from getting a new job, might be not a bad idea to also see if you qualify for displaced worker retraining (could be offered by your state's UI department, some are through non-profit agencies like Goodwill), or going back to school to finish a degree/post bac studies/grad degree.

Most people are recommending you watch Micronesia which is in some ways needs a bit of lead up itself. So looking at seasons which help for watching Micronesia AND for watching HvV, I would say Panama is a good solid option (Cirie/Danielle) OR China (Amanda/James/Courtney).\n\nSo in the end I'm going to say I'd go with Panama by a hair over China.

If you make yourself such a big target that you need final immunity, it's a hiccup but if you're reasonably good at challenges probably a good risk. If you need to win the last 2 challenges, again it might be a decent chance if you're strong but definitely you've failed on some level at keeping in shields and being UTR.

If he stays healthy for the majority of the year then this signing was a success. Mozgovwas one of the best options for veteran centers in this free agent class.\n\nFurthermore, people need to get over the prices. We have a new cap ceiling now so all the prices are going to go up. When Mozgov makes 16 mil next year it will basically be like he is making 11 mil (or so) this past year. 11 mil is pretty average for a starting center, so this isn't that big of deal.\n\n","score":"6","subreddit":"lakers"}

El carácter político lo prueban en la forma en que se hizo la detención, la clasificación de delitos y el encierro en penales federales en otros estados alejados a donde se cometieron los supuestos delitos de los que los acusan (además del mismo contexto de lucha y el papel que tienen los detenidos).\n\nEstas diciendo que no crees que sean culpables? Es razonable que los pongan en carceles donde no la gente no vaya a tratar de liberarlos a la fuerza, que no dudo que sean capaces de algo tan tonto los de la cnte.\n\n\u0026gt;Y namas te digo que no se trata de movilizaciiones de indios violentos en Oaxaca o Chiapas, pues cuantos meses ya llevan las protestas violentas en Francia por la ley del trabajo y precisamente de ahí se retomaron las barricadas como forma de lucha y protesta.  \n\nLas protestas violentas son injustificables,  no importa en que pais lo hagan. Y si la gente que protesta fuera mejor que \"indios violentos\" (tus palabras), protestarian con argumentos logicos, propuestas razonables, peticiones basadas en la ley, no encuentro un solo ejemplo donde lo hayan intentado, asi que no estoy convencido de que lo hagan solo por que solo asi les ponen atencion.  \n\n\u0026gt;Puede ser que no, pero sí le quita la autoridad moral a este gobierno que dice que hace la reforma para mejorar la educación (no hay contenidos eduactivos en la reforma, sólo evaluativos-punitivos) y para combatir la corrupción en la educación (por qué no lo han hecho con el sindicato que controlan, con los demás sindicatos que controlan de otros séctores y con ellos mismos).  \n\nLa evaluacion no ha causado el despido de nadie asi que no hay pruebas de que sea punitiva, y hasta ahora la cnte no ha demostrado tener mayor autoridad moral que el gobierno, al menos el gobierno si esta metiendo algunos corruptos a la carcel, solo por que no ha empezado por tus corruptos favoritos no significa que no esten haciendo su trabajo. Que actos de corrupcion ha prevenido la cnte? Cuantos maestros con doble plaza ha denunciado?  \n\n\u0026gt;La cantidad de cosas que puedes cambiar cuando no hay dinero para infraestructura es reducida. Pero al menos en Oaxaca se han preocupado por formas ciudadanos pensantes con una educación íntegra, ahí las pruebas enlace que se hacían a nivel nacional no tenían validez, pero te sé de Veracruz que por meses los maestro en vez de dar clases ponían a los niños a contestar exámenes para salir bien en la prueba Enlace. Freire decía que el niño no debe de ser un cajón al que se le llene de conocimientos ejercitando la memoria, tiene que ser una hoguera que debe ser encendida ejercitando su creatividad e iniciativa.\nLas dobles y varias plazas se dan en el Snte y continúan aún en Veracruz, no en la Cnte donde no puedes tener dos plazas porque le quita capacidad de gente que puede movilizar como sindicato. Lo de heredar plazas pues sí se puede negociar y debe ser eliminado.  \n\nNo hay dinero? la cnte tiene lideres con sueldos millonarios y tuvieron el control de la secretaria de educacon estatal, tambien tenian control de las nominas y de las plazas. Sin mencionar que con una protesta tenian al gobernador en la bolsa. La cnte ha demostrado cero interes en la educacion o en mejorar la infraestructura de las escuelas de los estados del sur. Comparar a oaxaca con veracruz es irrelevante, el punto es que no han sido capaces dde levantar un dedo por la educacion de los niöos. Sigues hablando sobre formar la creatividad, pero la creatividad sin saber leer y escribir no significa mucho, sin mencionar que no ayuda a conseguir un trabajo que les de un salario digno. Esas son enseöanzas basicas que todo niöo debe saber y que la cnte ignoro por andar atendiendo a los lideres. Quisiera saber de que forma ha mejorado la cnte a oaxaca que no sea para crear gente que beneficie a los lideres de la cnte, eso no me suena a que hayan creado ciudadanos criticos, idependientes.  \n\n\u0026gt;Los beneficios hacia los líderes siempre fueron a espaldas a la asamblea de maestros, siempre fue la forma en que el gobierno en vez de negociar decidía comprar a los líderes. Pero te digo, ese dinero hacía los líderes fue dinero desperdiciado porque nunca lograron acallar ni comprar el movimiento completo de la Cnte. Comprar líderes le funciona al gobierno en sindicatos charros como el de la Snte o el de Pemex, pero donde la base del sindicato ejerce el poder en asambleas el gobierno desperdicia dinero de impuestos para comprar líderes. A toda esa cantidad de gente que apoya la reforma sólo la veo en twitter y aquí en /r/México, y muy poquitos en Facebook, pero en la vida real no conozco a uno sólo que diga \"el gobierno tiene la razón, la Cnte está equivocada.\"  \n\nClaro no acataron lo que el gobierno les indicaba, pero tampoco usaron ninguno de sus beneficios en favor de los niöos. Si no crees que hay gente a favor de la reforma puedes checar las estadisticas de la gente que hace la evaluacion, que ya son bastantes, los unicos estados rezagados son oaxaca y chiapas (vaya sorpresa). La reforma es mas importante que la cnte o la desconfianza que puedas tener hacia el gobierno. Es una ley necesaria. Estoy de acuerdo en que podria revisarse, y si la cnte quiere negociar su **implementacion** debe dar argumentos logicos, razonables y precisos. Pero no deberia sacrificarse algo que puede hacer mucho bien a muchos niöos solo por que los lideres van a extraöar heredar sus plazas.","score":"1","subreddit":"mexico"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; In your experience, what are the most common security faux pas you see by otherwise intelligent and experienced IT staff?\n\nI think the most glaringly obvious one is a lax password policy. IT staff are especially guilty of it, mainly because they have so many systems to manage. I see weak passwords on servers more than desktops anymore. It's such a simple thing to overlook, but it can be the downfall of an entire network if discovered. And some of these servers are externally facing! \n\n\u0026gt;What are the simplest changes we can make to dramatically improve security?\n\nThe simplest change we can make as a society is to think about security during your daily operation. When you're browsing a site you've never been to, or you got an email for a UPS package, just stop and think.. \"Does this site seem legitimate? What's the domain? .RU doesn't sound very safe.\" Or, \"I don't have anything being shipped through UPS. Why did I get this email? What could happen if I open it?\" If we kept security in mind even a little bit, half of the breaches that occur would cease to exist. And lastly, don't be afraid to ask or admit a mistake. We're human. We don't know everything. Ask a specialist. Ask IT. Tell them if something happened that could cause a breach. Often times, people are too scared to fess up to clicking an attachment for fear of getting in trouble. But the reality is, we're gonna find out anyway.

{"body":"\u0026gt;Do the staff of a business know somebody is testing security?\n\nSometimes. There is white box and black box pentesting. Typically if you are doing a physical assessment, it's black box, which means only the owner, and maybe a very select few people know you're coming. I consider this the \"proper\" form of pentesting. I think it provides the most benefit when the company doesn't know you're coming. \n\n\u0026gt;What happens if you get the cops called on you/get noticed doing things like accessing server rooms?\n\nWe carry a document signed by the CEO of the company at ALL times when doing anything physical. It states why we're there, and that we're authorized to do it. A lot of the times, the cops won't actually believe you.. and you will be arrested. Eventually, they calm down and call the owner or get in touch with my lead or something, and everything gets ironed out.. but I have been \"arrested\" a couple times. \n\n\u0026gt;How does a company work get pentested/communicate what they tested?\n\nI don't quite know what you mean. Are you asking how they tell us what to test?\n\n\u0026gt;How many limits are usually placed on you (e.g. don't touch this server please)?\n\nThey often times tell us not to hit production stuff if they have a dev environment, since they mimic the production environment, and will not cause downtime if we break it. However, the typical rule of thumb is, if we find an exploit that causes a denial of service like MS14-031 or something, we will ask the tech lead of the company before exploiting it. Basically if it can cause an outage, ask first.\n\n\u0026gt;Are there\"teams\" assigned to pentesting each company or that specialize in different areas?\n\nIt varies. Sometimes it's based on proximity to the site, sometimes its by specialty. If a company specifically requests something like wireless specialty, or some specialization like SCADA, you get a specialist on like a 1099 contract for that engagement specifically.","score":"3","subreddit":"hacking"}

It's the major reason that a large number of incredibly effective powerlifting programs are high volume. One of the most well known powerlifting programming methods from the champion Russian coach Boris Sheiko is based on a high volume of lifts and sets in the 70-85% range, and as you can see it's actually not even \"high intensity\".\n\nAlso there is a strong correlation between strength and size. Muscular hypertrophy is one of the main strength mechanisms. As your muscles get bigger you get stronger. Simples.\n\nAnd why do bodybuilders and powerlifters train differently? Specificity for their chosen sports. Powerlifting is based around 3 specific lifts and all training is based around improving these lifts. Bodybuilders train for muscular hypertrophy and their training is based around gaining the most muscle in the most efficient manner, and there is further specificity in regards to improving different muscle groups.\n\nBut there are also some similarities between the training methods... powerlifters often add \"bodybuilding\" work to increase their muscle mass to get just stronger or move up into a weight class more suited to their height/bone structure. Some bodybuilders find heavy low rep training very effective for muscle gains, or like to focus on strength for a while so they can increase their overall training volume or protect themselves from injury.\n\nSo yeah... um... you're kinda wrong.","score":"19","subreddit":"Fitness"}

{"body":"I'd like you to search up on google \"you're slow because you're weak\". Personally as a coach my phases of training that revolves around the sprinting season. If my best sprinters have a 40-inch vertical doing little jump training beyond weight room work, it will probably work for you, too.  \n  \nFirst off I recommend that you have a squat of about 2x your body weight before you get into any crazy explosive work. Most people won't build a 2x BW squat in a matter of months, it may take them a few seasons but try this:  \n  \nOff season: heavy lifting, 3-5 reps.  \n  \n3 months before basketball season: Plyo work.  \n  \n1 month before: basketball season: general conditioning work, mainly focusing on your layups (or dunks.) Your actual basketball skill here is much more important than any lifting numbers in this stage.  \n\nOptionally you could follow a vertical-jump basketball style routine instead of Plyo work. But back when I played basketball and I wasn't training very smart the quickest way I went from being able to grab the rim to being almost able to dunk (if I knew how) was by taking two weeks off of sports to give myself a rest.  \n  \nNo heavy squats should be done about a month before your competitive season to give hour CNS a break. You could however keep benching closer to the date that you start your season.  \n  \nDuring your basketball season you can work out a bit, doing some low volume (heavy) stuff but mostly high volume (light intensity) \"recovery\" stuff.  \n  \nHope this helps, good luck.","score":"1","subreddit":"Fitness"}

So i try to not stretch it at all and focus on keeping the muscle active as much as possible which should keep blood pumping in that general area more so then it would if you just sat up on the couch all day or desk chair. I will do light leg swings and some lunges here and there. Also i find setting something heavy on rolling it back and forth on across the area slowly really realese tension. An example would be to take a 45lb plate and roll it back and forth or a have a person with a rolling pin and with a good amount of pressure roll it back and forth.

With some salvaging I got a pretty high-spec bike for less than $500. \n\nI salvaged a couple of decent parts off some other bikes and used my old frame, so the $500-ish was for the important things, for example [Inferno 25](https://sun-ringle.com/mtb/rims/inferno-25/) rims.  \nI got this particular [Alivio](http://www.jensonusa.com/Shimano-M4000-Alivio-9-SPEED-Derailleur) rear derailer because it has a very effective B-tension screw, and a much slimmer mount so it's less likely to be bashed on stuff, and it's a pretty solid rear mech that worked with the 8-speed cassette I used to have.  \n[Jagwire incompressible](http://jagwire.com/products/v/road_pro) brake housing made my mechanical disc brakes absolutely phenomenal, much better than entry-level hydraulics.  \nI also got [a better caliper](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/ca/en/shimano-cx77-mechanical-disc-brake-caliper/rp-prod120012) than my cheap-ish original calipers, for the front where I need the control. It's also great because it's got a really long arm that doesn't damage cables and is tolerant to pre-loading, but it has a dial-in screw so I never need to preload much. This was a salvage part from year ago though so not part of the main costs.  \nThe [Avid Speed-Dial](https://www.sram.com/avid/products/speed-dial-7) levers are super solid and let me control the grab of the front and rear brakes separately, also to compensate for the fact I have a CX caliper on the front and a mountain one on the back.  \nPut a [cheap 180mm](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/ca/en/shimano-slx-zee-deore-rt66-6-bolt-disc-rotor/rp-prod82436) rotor up front for a lot of extra oomph, I didn't know I needed it until I went for a fast and hairy downhill ride and ended up with terrible hand fatigue and insanely stiff finger joints.  \nSince I have flat bars, a good friend of mine gave me the [Titec El Norte II](http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/252026753837-0-1/s-l1000.jpg) downhill bars, a very significant handlebar upgrade.   \nI salvaged a riser stem too, because I was getting wrist pain from leaning over too much. The shorter reach made my handling faster too.  \nPlus I got a (cheap) new crankset because my old ones actually had 20,000 commuter kilometers on it, I now have one of the ones where you can swap out each individual gear. I did my [custom 4-chainring](http://i.imgur.com/Sb1P7LU.jpg) mod to it so combined with a custom 11-36 9-speed cassette I have 36 speeds.

I promise it's much cleaner.  \nGot some random cheap Specialized ergo-grips for like $20 as well, my old ones were falling off.  \nFor tires I have an extremely old but extremely high-quality Specialized Infinity-brand tire, take a look at the fork image below to see the sidewall and a bit of the tread. It's not made anymore and I can't find it online anywhere. The tread pattern comes from old commuter bikes, but I find the tread works great off-road, yet the very thin skinwalls let it roll terribly fast on the road. Found it hanging in a small bike store for $20.  \nSince I'm mainly commuting on this bike I splurged on a good road tire, the rear tire is a [40c Marathon Supreme](http://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/marathon_supreme), which was very expensive but I'm not counting it because it's not really a cross tire, it's the best road tire I've ever rode and it has *just* enough tread to really hold it's own on crap terrain but I would probably put something more like the [Kenda Kwicker](http://bicycle.kendatire.com/en-us/find-a-tire/bicycle/cyclocross-gravel/kwicker-pro/) if I was competing.  \nOh and how could I forget! The amazing [Kona P2](http://sellwoodcycle.com/products/29-kona-p2-fork) fork, after I wrecked my shitty Suntour shocks. I [busted my first P2](http://imgur.com/WZ7EtE5) after two years and just got another one, let's hope it lasts this time.  ","score":"1","subreddit":"bicycling"}

It's far more satisfying to just put the content out on the web, for free, and let people enjoy it, rather than deal with marketing and try to convince people to pay to read your content. The thing about books is, the physical materials cost the same amount of money no matter what's printed on it, and it's cheaper to mass-produce.

And before we say that the highest demand parking conicides with the highest real estate prices and therefore those residents can afford to pay that price, let's also not forget that the Pearl, for example, includes somewhere around 20-25% affordable housing.
