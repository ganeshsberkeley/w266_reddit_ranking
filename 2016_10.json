If Jesus never actually considered bowing down to Satan, then would it really be a temptation?\n\nI think this is a great way to look at it. I'm reminded of G.K Chesterton's take on the crucifixion:\n\n\u0026gt;When the world shook and the sun was wiped out of heaven, it was not at the crucifixion, but at the cry from the cross: the cry which confessed that God was forsaken of God. And now let the revolutionists choose a creed from all the creeds and god from all the gods of the world, carefully weighing all the gods of the world, carefully weighing all the gods of inevitable recurrence and of unalterable power. They will not find another god who has himself been in revolt. Nay (the matter grows too difficult for human speech), but let the atheists themselves choose a god. They will find only one divinity who ever uttered their isolation; only one religion in which God seemed himself for an instant to be an atheist.\n\nTo read the crucifixion as a moment at which Christ really did feel the desperation that every human would to me is a lot like what's going on in the painting. It's not just some theatre for children were God acts like he's tempted but he's still in control. Christ in the Desert for Kramskoy really faced the moment the same way everybody else does. \n\nThe idea of God truly experiencing what utter isolation and desperation is essentially bridges the gulf between God and humans that's supposed to be there. This version of God isn't just in the 'big picture' but he's really there even in the most terrible situation. I think that's what makes the painting so powerful. ","score":"193","subreddit":"Art"}

The rest since has been shit tier lack luster, poorly thought out gimmicks.  The worst being that Bronze, silver, gold container bullshit event(plsccp no more of that).  So now here we are full circle with another blood raider event.  \n\nAccelerators and the Newly added mini-injectors (currently only for new characters) are a great carrot on a stick for Eve online.  A sandbox left alone will get content, but if you throw a carrot that's yummy enough, it will drive content like no other.  I have seen a lot of people out in space contesting these sites.  Which is exactly what Eve needs.  MORE PEOPLE IN SPACE UNDOCKED.  \n\nIts still not enough.  CCP is still falling short on these events.  The rewards need to be staggered.  High sec, Low sec, null/wh.  The rewards should get better in Low/null/WH space, with High sec being the worst.  This will lead to pushing people out into dangerous space more.  The difficulty should be as such as well.  High should be simple, Low sec sites should be able to be done in siimple PvP fits(frig/dessie), and null/wh sites should be a tad harder but still doable in bigger pvp fits (cruiser+).  This is important.  You have to be able to run sites in a pvp fit or a fit designed to help the person survive an encounter.\n\nThere needs to be another reward that drives people into space.  Accelerators are great and should be the \"rare\" reward.  The uncommon and common rewards should be the ship skins and Jackets.  The \"ultra rare\" reward should be the new Mini-Injectors(would only drop in Low/Null/WH C3+).  These would of course keep the no trade, no sell, no contract attributes they have now.  It will simply be only for the char that loots it.  \n\nNow you have a tier system with natural risk versus reward progression that leads directly to character progression in Eve online.  Its the one true carrot on a stick that CCP can use to their advantage to get people out into dangerous space.  \n\nWhich in turn means more content for everyone.  ","score":"20","subreddit":"Eve"}

This change would have been a viable idea 3 years ago before the bombing changes were made, but in today's meta it's just retardedly OP, especially since Command DDs and T3Ds make it so much stronger that it would have otherwise been.\n\nMy biggest problem with it is it's completely ignorant of the fact that destroyers are already the anti-bomber role the way it's meant to be played, because the way you are supposed to defend bombers is by fucking shooting them before the bombs go off (well one of the ways).  There is already a well established counter play to bombers that we worked on previous CSMs to fine tune.  Bomber counter play is one of the more unique aspects of PVP that really gives it depth.  There are established best practices now for both post-nerf bombers and anti-bomber tactics that are well documented and provide one of the more challenging aspects of this game for both sides.  The bomber nerfs worked, in fact they were so effective that bombers have essentially fallen out of the meta and are sparingly used by only a few elite groups.  With the introduction of Boson's the meta is already shifting away from slow, high sig, tightly anchored fleet comps.  This is just an unnecessarily stupid nerf to bombers that is way too OP, it's is so far off the mark that I actually thought it was fake the first time I saw it.\n\nI mean Fuzzy you were there when we had all the bomber talks three years ago, we played around with other ideas like this and considered them OP then, I just do not understand how this is it not considered OP now when bombers are probably 1/10th as prevalent as they were then.","score":"21","subreddit":"Eve"}

{"body":"It's frustrating but the laws are purposefully vague. Once they start putting mandates on training, it then is putting a mandate on a disability to be able to function in public. I.e. My epilepsy: If I were diagnosed with epilepsy, and told the best route for me to live an independent life would be to get a service animal. Let's say the Feds decided to put a 200 hour training requirement on all epilepsy detecting animals. I'm now required to spend well over $2,000 on my disability. It's akin if you were put in a wheel chair, the government would force anyone in a wheel chair to have an electric one with bells and whistles. There aren't federal regulations on people in wheel chairs. You can't \"prove\" someone in a wheel chair needs it, you can't require proof that someone needs it and you can't require specifications of that wheel chair. \n\nWhat they *can* do (and did do) via the ADA of 1965 is require shops and public places *accommodate* people with disabilities to a realistic extent. This means for people in wheel chairs making doors accessible, isles a certain degree of width. For people with service animals it goes: they may ask if it's a service animal. And they may ask what tasks the animal performs. Period. That's it. They can't require identification, can't ask about my disability, can't charge me a fee nor refuse my admittance or put me in a *special* section. \n\nEdit: back to the question at hand - am I pissed? Not really. Some people genuinely need their animal for anxiety comfort, something which requires literally 0 training. But am I going to pester each person with an anxiety animal about their need? Absolutely not. I actually enjoy talking about my disability and sharing some of my stories about my animal, but others *don't* and that's their right. Sure some people will abuse it, but what's the worse that's going to happen? Some prissy woman complains about their dog just like I've had people complain about mine? Ok. Complain away. I need my animal and I'm not going to force someone else to defend their need of theirs. ","score":"25","subreddit":"aww"}

More than the numbers though I'm just in awe of his sheer skillset combined with his size making him a complete mismatch for opposing guards. Like you had to put a wing on him and force your team into a crossmatch from the start\n\n-Elite post up game. Regularly made opposing guards look like children ([case and point: Stockton](https://youtu.be/HgkzqOT25ik?t=40s)), had incredible footwork and a book of counter moves at his disposal. I'm talking Kobe level of post skill and really one of the GOAT's on the block in terms of non big men\n\n-Broke down defenders off the dribble with ease using his combination of elite ball skill and quickness. Super creative at the rim able to contort his body in mid air to convert wild shots, very strong finisher and got fouled a ton when defenders couldn't handle his size and speed combination. And even if you packed the paint, he was a great off the dribble mid range shooter\n\n-Took care of the ball and had excellent court vision. Only reason his apg is relatively low is because he played a lot off ball at SG and the offense often ran through Shaq\n\n-Could guard 1-3 with his size and strength, great team defender often turning defense (steals) into instant transition offense where the Magic lived\n\n\nCould talk about dude and that season forever.

All those talks were real. If KD were to leave OKC, which team would give him the best chance to win not only a championship, but multiple championships? Boston is a good team, but with KD, they're not necessarily better than Cleveland or better than Warriors and Spurs. Spurs wouldn't work because they already have a top SF in Kawhi Leonard. Warriors are literally the perfect fit for KD not only personnel wise, but play style wise. It's really a no-brainer if you want to put yourself the best position to win championships, and I hope KD wins multiple championships to shut all the haters up.\n\nAnyone who says they themselves wouldn't do what KD did are hypocrites, because you're essentially saying you'd do what EVERYONE ELSE WANTS instead of doing what's best for you.

Two of our losses so far have been to undefeated teams with arguably the best defenses in the League. The other was an ugly loss to a division rival, but not for nothing, we were missing our starting LT and RB. The lack of run game made our offense one dimensional and we lacked protection without Oher out there. The rest fell to our rookie/2nd string corners getting gashed by the League's second best receiver.\n\nWe're not as good as we were last year, and we definitely benefited somewhat from an easy schedule. But a team doesn't go 15-1 and waltz through their conference in the postseason by getting lucky. We may not even be a bad this year.

These days QBs and OCs know they can literally just zip the ball at the CBs back before he has a chance to turn around and it's a decent percentage play that you draw a flag.\n\nAlso, to those of you saying \"Well, if a receiver gets behind you, you can just tackle them!\"...\n\n1. If you're getting beat so badly that you feel the need to knock the guy down, you probably aren't going to catch up to him\n\n2. A lot of the time these would probably be holding/illegal contact penalties, not PI. Only if it happened to be in the second or two that the ball is in the air would it be PI.\n\n3.

It's one thing when somebody who played in the league 10 years is questioning their interpretation of a play. It's another when some generic fan on reddit does. Pretty sure I can tell who is more likely to have bias or not know what they are talking about in that case.  Theyve worked with alot of people when it comes to how to evaluate. Clearly former players like Chris Collinsworth readily endorse it to say the least. \n\nWhat often is questionable is how fans can try to correlate those type of stats into a grade without watching those players closely. It's kind of like how all these Bengals fans would try and tell me \"See Andy Dalton is now really good when under pressure he threw 0 INTs when under pressure last year guys according to the stats!!\" \n\nI do agree those signature stats being gone does suck. As theyve become more famous I guess this comes with the territory. Likewise, not a big fan of how they just have grades ready literally right after a game is done without looking at All 22 and clearly not going through some super deep vetting process if it is done so suddenly. They claim they adjust the grades when All 22 is out but let's not also sit and act like that's a fairly convenient thing to say","score":"-3","subreddit":"nfl"}

Julio dropped a pass that hit him right in the hands and gave you guys the ball and great field position.\n\nAll in all, it was an amazing and exciting game to watch. At half-time, I thought were were royally screwed and it was cool to see us come back out and exploit your explosive D for 3 TD's like that.\n\nSure, Ju might have gotten away with a quick hands to the face, I'll admit that. We're talking about (arguably) the #1 WR and the #1 CB in the NFL matched up here, and the refs decided to let them play. It is what it is. Sherm's hands were on Ju's face too, but I think it's pretty obvious Julio snuck in a little push off. However, if that were called every time it happens in that type of press coverage, that would be insanity. It happens so damn often and is rarely called because these are physical, top notch players. No one grabbed anyone's facemask and the ordeal was over in a millisecond. \n\nAll that said, it was a great game, and we should have been able to put you guys away without having to rely on that DPI, and we couldn't do it.

{"body":"\u0026gt; Some Russian hackers used stolen credit cards to buy keys and then sell them via paypal for buds.\n\nUhh, think you're a little confused. They were using the hatconomy to launder stolen credit card funds. They'd purchase shit like keys with the nicked CC numbers, then sell them to players via paypal at a technical loss. Because there was no formal way to link a Steam item trade with a paypal transaction, it allowed them to make off with most of the credit cards' value in an untraceable manner. Depending upon how paranoid they were, they'd sometimes shuffle the keys around multiple accounts and trade them back and forth for other stable commodities before cashing out via paypal so that by the time the credit card was reported stolen, most of the keys would have ended up in 20 different legitimate players' backpacks and there was no way to delete them without creating another 2010 Max's Head scandal.\n\nAs for the tanking value of metal, it also didn't help that you couldn't cash out metal on the community market for 'steam wallet funds' but could with keys, creating a huge disparity in utility and demand. The community market was introduced after the 2.33ref price point collapsed but shortly before we saw runaway inflation. IIRC, keys were going for somewhere between 3 and 3.66ref at the time of the community market's introduction and was at something like 8ref some six months later.","score":"18","subreddit":"tf2"}

You're going to run into working breeders who do not breed to standard and are still reputable breeders, and show breeders who are breeding \"past \"the standard for more extreme features which may not be considered reputable.\n\nIf a dog has obviously garbage structure, it's typically safe to assume they are not \"well bred\" as reputable show line and reputable working line breeders should be striving to produce sound dogs. Other than that, you're going to have a tough time clearly distinguishing between the two from sight alone.\n\nI have a working line Tervuren. She lacks \"breed type\" because she doesn't look like a show Terv. That doesn't mean she isn't extremely well bred. \n\nOP, if you are wanting to learn more about this, we can link you to resources to learn about proper structure in dogs and obvious faults to look for.

Then their first comeback as 4 with Youngji with Mamma Mia was good (better than Pandora/Damaged Lady) but Cupid was pretty bad. KARA is the best with a dance track.\n\nOn the flip side, I'm almost a fan of every single one of their Japanese singles and most songs on their albums. If they can't promote in Korea together, I hope they do in Japan still. Slight hope still exists as Gyuri says they really technically haven't disbanded.\n\nAs for EXO, I agree. I always preferred EXO as a whole instead of K and M. Primary reason why I prefered Growl\u0026gt;Overdose is because everyone performed on one stage. And thanks to Kris/Luhan/Tao we now get a permanent whole EXO group without members being split up Plus Kris/Luhan/Tao are doing fine without EXO so it seems like a win-win.\n\nRed Velvet Yeri.

{"body":"Let's play this out. So you get fired for violating the non-compete. You think this is wrong and hire a lawyer to sue for wrongful termination. You apply for unemployment and a month later you hear your employer is contesting it, because you violated your non compete. Low on money, you begin asking friends to help cover the bills. Your friends are also teachers so can't lend you much, but you get by. 3 months later you finally get your court day...for unemployment. The judgment on your unemployment is on hold because the non-compete in your contract is still being litigated. During this time you start running out of money and start looking for another job. You have an interview at another school, but they heard you're currently suing another school district, troublemaker. You don't get the job. Almost a year goes by when you finally get your day in court. The judge listens to your lawyer, then they listen to the schools lawyer. That drags on, then you finally get a judgment that the non compete was invalid and you were wrongfully terminated. They appeal, you win. Two years go by. Unfortunately your lost your house 6 months ago so you're bouncing between address. You didn't realize you had an unemployment hearing after the judgment, but since you didn't get the letter sent to the wrong address, you miss the court date and the case is thrown out. You've overdrafted your account and maxed out your credit cards, banks start closing your accounts.

I've seen a lot of men in a dead-end job who worked very hard at what they did, but kept \"expecting\" something to happen to make it better for them. \n\nA particular job that jumps to mind was an outsourced agency that doubled as a pool for people to move into an FTE position with the company that contracted it. This happened infrequently, but whenever a position in the contracting company came open, they would open it to employees in the outsourced agency first since they were already trained and familiar with the work, and many had outside qualifications that met the companies requirements. A number of people were hired as FTEs in the time that I worked there.\n\nHowever there were many men and women who were simply content to expect a position to be given solely to them and wouldn't do anything to make themselves stand out. They would do sloppy  and bare-minimum work and believed that they would get promoted based on seniority alone. Then newer hires that impressed with their work would be promoted ahead of them, and they became embittered. Even then, they wouldn't actively look for another position elsewhere because they believed \"their time would come.\"\n\nI was the most senior employee there, and when I left that agency for a much higher paying job with much better opportunities (I wasn't interested in moving into the contracting company, I had worked there previously), many of them wondered how I got so \"lucky.\" When I told them that I had been steadily applying for the same position in the same company every three months for two and a half years, I could almost hear the walls slam shut in their mind. It wasn't luck. I kept applying when I was rejected or didn't hear anything and kept working on the skills the job required. \n\nA lot of people, men and women, don't understand that no one is going to turn a crappy situation around for them except themselves. You can wait forever for an opportunity that doesn't come because you expect it, or you can do your best to make an opportunity happen. \n\nYou can't always pull yourself up by your bootstraps, but you also shouldn't wait for fate to smile on you.

{"body":"**Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain**\n\n253 hours in, 85% done. All main and side missions complete.\n\nI rate it 9/10, coming from a fan of the series' story. I love the lore. I love the ideas Kojima is addressing. I have some criticisms but mostly praise.\n\nMy co-workers grew up playing these games, I had not, and I wanted to be in on the conversation. I watched 'movies' of all the previous games, downloaded from YouTube, in release order, and I played Metal Gear Rising: Revengence (great fun). Then I played Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes. I put almost 20 hours in GZ learning to be stealthy (not a strong suit of mine) and doing the extra missions (couldn't find all the patches.) I loved the sandbox nature of that game!\n\nI play with keyboard and mouse. My Roccat Tyon needed to be refurbished part way through so I switched to a Roccat Kone. No problems with this setup; I put zoom, crouch, melee, and the action/item wheel on mouse buttons. That leaves movement, sprinting and activating binoculars for my keyboard hand. I did try using a controller after my Tyon broke, but it was not as fluid or intuitive for me as k/m.\n\nI was happy with the story. I was thrilled with the gameplay. I surprised myself by getting into building Mother Base, which I was not looking forward to initially.\n\nAt first D-Horse was my ride, how convenient and stealthy! Then D-Dog was my pal, very useful, much information. I must admit that I fell in lust with Quiet. She made capturing outposts into easy mode when I could no longer be bothered; I'd let her scout and cover me. It was perfect mid-late game assist and I felt we were beginning to have a real connection (we did max out that connection). I still [Spoiler](#s \"mourn the loss after she left me.\") D-Dog is back in the fold. I did not look up how to get the TRUE ending, but it seems that I did the right things [Spoiler](#s \"with Quiet anyway.\")\n\nHal - [Spoiler](#s \"screw that guy. So suspicious. I was glad to see him go. The nerve he had blaming me for the deaths of the infected, and for even questioning D-Dog's heritage.\") Disappointed I never got to [Spoiler](#s \"use the mech he was designing on a mission\"), I have a phantom pain about that. Maybe it was the point.\n\nI liked the story. I appreciated [Spoiler](#s \"Words That Kill\") being the next step (or the precursor) to memes as genes. I liked seeing Big Boss' continued expansion and escalation and being part of that. [Spoiler](#s \"The beginning mission struck me as odd, you know, where you make your avatar and it's not used, where you meet yourself in the hospital, and I totally thought I was imagining it later in the game. I felt full closure (and chills) when I completed the TRUTH mission. Now the soldiers on Motherbase even speak to me slightly differently.\") Little touches like that push this game above others, if you pay attention to details.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent. Every missions a self contained 'episode' where I need to figure out an approach. I've even enjoyed revisiting missions now that I'm finished, to extract the specialist I missed the first time or get a blueprint, because I can do it differently since I have better tech, and technique, at my disposal. I can't do justice to how well the gameplay is executed.\n\nAfter you complete story mission 22 things get more complex with FOB invasions available. I wish I would have read up on this a little more early on, because they were intimidating and not well explained. Now that I understand them thanks to a Reddit user, I'm enjoying them. Read this thread if you are confused about FOBs.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/4z4wbu/has_anyone_else_had_a_really_difficult_time/d6trxdq?context=3\n\nI did start feeling burnt out because of the repetitive nature of the side missions, not to mention the main mission repeats. When that happened, I stopped doing side missions for a little while which helped.\n\nThe game could have done with 2/3rds less side missions, no main mission repeats (except for [Spoiler](#s \"TRUTH\")), no chapter 1 \u0026amp; 2 split, and a smaller Mother Base. I don't need 13 missions to extract heavy infantry... that being said, I finished them later after I completed the main TRUE story.\n\nWhat is left? Am I fighting the urge to try and S rank everything and 100% the game? I don't know. I am having separation anxiety... There are other games to play... but I don't want to let this one go quite yet, it's too good. I do want to try Metal Gear Online and see what that is about, I have yet to touch it. I need to watch that mission 51 video on YouTube this weekend.\n\nWhat a ride! What a great game.\n\nEDIT: more SPOILER tags\n","score":"60","subreddit":"Games"}

I'm actually not a big folk music fan (what I know about Dylan comes mostly through my father, who is a big folk fan and I *think* first saw Dylan in Greenwich Village before his first album came out when my father was still in high school), but I still think he's eminently deserving of the award (though I hope Ismail Kadare and Murikami get the prize before they die). \n\nI just remembered hearing an NPR story about his nomination years ago, and how an American literature professor was doing the actually nominating, probably a decade ago or more ago, and I could put the rest together through Google. My sister was involved in the museum world for years (though she's now a management consultant) and I remember having a family conversation about the nomination in terms of \"What are the boundaries of fine art?,\" which is a question that I think can be fun to talk about. As soon as I saw the news, I knew that question would be one of the main topics of debate here. There's a power to the first draft, as one of my college professors said, in that when you propose an idea, others have to respond to you and the argument and evidence you put forward, so I wanted to get in early so I could help direct the conversation, especially since Reddit's algorithm has a big problem with late comments in these large threads.

{"body":"*Notes from Underground* is a study of the paradoxes of the human mind. You have someone who is overwhelmingly arrogant and at the same time morbidly depressed and self-criticizing. You have someone who is judgmental of people who have the resolve to act on their beliefs, dismissing them as being shortsighted, but who also recognizes the futility of the paralysis of inaction. It's a masterpiece at portraying the dual nature of the least desirable aspects of humanity, aspects that may or may not dwell within us. It's one of the best character studies ever written, at least as far as I'm concerned. \n\nThe book is divided into two sections. The first half is him freewheeling through his philosophy and reads as a sort of scribbled manifesto. The second half is more \"novel-like\" and examines several situations where you see how this philosophy might play out in real life situations. For what it's worth, *Notes from Underground* was excruciating to read, particularly the first half (the second half, on the other hand, I read through in a single sitting). I fell asleep with the book in my hand, multiple times. It is incredibly dense. However, it is also one of the most enriching books I've ever read. I read it 4-5 years ago and still think about it regularly. It gets better upon reflection, I promise- you have to give it some time to settle, so to speak. It's also an excellent primer for various character aspects portrayed in *The Brothers Karamazov,* which is, in my opinion, Dostoevsky's masterpiece.\n\nI think the greatest art (this is especially the case with the Golden Age Russian writers) don't *answer* questions, but instead encourage us to *ask* questions. You're intended to read his philosophy, see where his mentality leads him, and draw your own conclusions. Is his philosophy valid? Is it enriching? How much? Should we learn from him? Can we learn from him? If he's wrong, why/how is he wrong? How much is he wrong? Is his philosophy conceptually sound but practically useless? Can anything be taken from it of worth? Is this extreme the end result of nihilism? Or is it the end result of too much self reflection? Is he simply an embodiment of the most sordid aspects of humanity, seen from within?

You can buy a bad cable and it can fry up a USB power supply, or it can fry up your device. A USB cable fried a Google engineer's Chromebook Pixel, the cable was miswired. Aside from that, there's different types of charging for USB in general, Quickcharge from Qualcomm, Adaptive Fast Charging from Samsung, Dash charging from OPPO, and finally, the USB-IF's own charging standard called Power Delivery. Each one is not compatible with the other (though a phone could handle multiple standards, so for instance most Samsungs can do Adaptive and Quickcharge) so you have to do your research on which power supply to buy in order to take advantage of fast charging on any given device. And now USB-C will change charging in the future to require an authentication chip so non-authenticated cables won't fuck up devices, so that means future phones with USB-C might not work with today's USB-C cables or chargers. Lightning however has always done authentication from day one so they don't generally have to deal with non-compliant cables and chargers frying devices.","score":"34","subreddit":"funny"}

I acknowledge the many wrongdoings Japan has done to my people, but I also understand that China uses these issues as a political tool, and often does things which condemn what they state.\n  \nAnd as an attempt to construct a bias argument, lets be straight here. China has the largest population in the world, as well as an economy experiencing massive growth. There's around 5-4 Chinese for every American, even. That's more than the disadvantage Japan experienced when they were completely overwhelmed by US forces during the second world war.  \n  \nFighting China won't work. This is why China continues to bully countries to get what they want. Because they can. They'll continue to make islands, prosecute certain minorities and restrict media because of this very reason. The only way we'll ever be able to stop them is if perhaps they fracture, which looks very unlikely considering the political grip the government has on its people. No matter what wonder weapon people invent, China will eventually improve their technology to match it.  \n  \nAs to alliances, that's an interesting notion, but it won't work. The countries surrounding China just rely on them too much to make such a definite move. If it were easy, the countries would do it in an instance. Any attempt to stifle them, they could do back to those countries in an instant.\n  \nI hate the situation, but quite honestly, there's nothing we can do about it. Any alliance the countries surrounding China could make would simply be too outmatched. Even if an alliance did occur, it would be just Japan pulling the weight. Maybe when countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and Philippines develop enough to become on par with the other developing nations, but given the current conditions, things look dismal.

What you're referring to as Linux,\nis in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.\nLinux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component\nof a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell\nutilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day,\nwithout realizing it.  Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU\nwhich is widely used today is often called \"Linux\", and many of its users are\nnot aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\n\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a\npart of the system they use.  Linux is the kernel: the program in the system\nthat allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.\nThe kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself;\nit can only function in the context of a complete operating system.  Linux is\nnormally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system\nis basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

{"body":"So I've told this story here before, but it might bear repeating.  When I was in college, many years ago, I lived in a quiet little house a few blocks off campus with two other students.  I happened to grow weed in my closet.  So, I liked to make baked goods at the time, and sometimes I would make a pan of pot brownies.  I would leave it out on the kitchen table with a note saying \"They are\" or \"They are not\", meaning either they do contain weed, or they do not.  It was a pretty wonderful time, I tell you.\n\nSo one morning I made some pot brownies and left them on the table with the note, then headed off to class.  That afternoon, my roommate got home, saw the brownies and ate one.  Then she went to her room to have a nap.\n\nAn hour later, she woke up with the ferocious munchies. She went into the kitchen, and there were the rich chocolate brownies.  She couldn't resist, so she ate two more.\n\nJust then her boyfriend stopped by to pick her up. She had forgotten that this was the night he was taking her home to meet his parents and have dinner. His parents lived an hour and a half away by car.\n\nShe became massively stoned on the way to her boyfriend's parent's house.\n\nBy the time they arrived, she was practically nonverbal. They had dinner, which she maowed into, then she rolled herself up in a blanket like a burrito on a couch.  Her boyfriend played it off that she had the flu.  His parents were not born yesterday, however, and they thought it was hilarious.  However, it's safe to say she did not make a good first impression.\n\nThey came home that night, and she was still very out of it.  \nShe was actually pretty out of it all the next day.","score":"32","subreddit":"trees"}

The moment you walked through the doorway the very first thing you saw was a bookcase which was, for the most part, empty. From waist-level up there was nothing normally stored on it. We used it as our \"runway\" for dropping off our keys when we got home. A few weeks before Christmas I bought her a gift. I wrapped it in bright, festive Christmas paper, tied a metallic ribbon around it, and placed it *at eye level* on that bookcase. The intention was to basically torture her by having her see this present every day when she got home and not be able to open it. *She never noticed it was there.* When we were opening presents from each other I pulled it off the bookcase and she commented that it was a weirdly obvious place to \"hide\" something, and she didn't believe me when I told her it had been there for several weeks.\n* When we were dating but not living together, she was hanging out at my apartment and we were watching television. A commercial for Reese's peanut butter cups came on and she immediately commented that she now wanted Reese's. It being almost midnight there were no stores open so I did a quick mental inventory, got up, collected a spoon, jar of peanut butter, and bag of chocolate chips from the kitchen, and put it in front of her. She looked at it and had *no idea* what to do with it. I opened the jar, scooped some PB, dipped it in the chips, and fed it to her. She proclaimed it better than actual Reese's and *it had never occurred to her* to simply put chocolate into peanut butter.

He rejected him at every turn, even though the greatest thing he could've done was taken Tyrion's aid. \n\nAs he was with Tyrion, Tywin was with the Starks and with Aerys. He took every insult particularly as it pertained to his family name, and even moreso, particularly as it reflected to him.

I was tired before I even got my ass to the starting line, tired of all the choices and imagining the work to get there, let alone doing it.\nLet's face it: I was a loser, without the energy or willpower to suck it up and give the world more than the bare minimum effort. Every day, I could stand up and be a hero. Or I could bum a cigarette and just escape and stand in the sun with my pals during a slow moment at Kinko's. I could stand there, and breathe, and laugh, and I was a little dizzy and my fingers tingled. It was fun. Sure, there'd be a price to pay someday. Christ's sake, my whole life was thinking about prices to pay someday. Like the student loans for that year I'd worked for my MA, before I gave up.\nNot too long before I was buying packs. Then, hell, a carton would actually save money.\nThe fun was gone before too long. Replaced by habit. Reflexive habit, burned into everything I did. Having a beer? Smoke. Waking up? Smoke. Finish a meal? Smoke.\nI knew my lungs were turning into sooty, tarry messes. But every step along the way was gradual. You get used to being winded, especially when you're eating nothing but greasy food out of styrofoam. You get used to coughing, when you live with your ex-girlfriend's cat despite your allergies. You get used to smelling terrible, when your apartment is already 300 square feet of bachelor stink.\nJesus Christ, I was a mess. The smoking was part of that. But at the same time, it was a middle finger to all of that. It was dangerous. I could light up and tell myself, \"Yeah, I'm okay with some risk,\" while wallowing in the same miserable routine I could have snapped out of by taking much less risk and sending out a damn resume.\nTen years later, I stubbed out my last cigarette. I was done. I lost 50 pounds. I had an adult career. But I have never forgotten how easy it was to pick up that first cigarette, how it started as an escape from a dull, awful day I didn't want to be part of, and how easy it was to build habits that improved my life instead of destroying it.","score":"-13","subreddit":"gaming"}

That books, games and movies are under a scrutiny that seems to believe that nobody has the ability to critically think and realize that context is key? We live in a time when a movie about the challenges trans individuals face was transphobic because a character within the movie who was transphobic deliberately misgendered the main character; when articles are written about a game creator having internalized misogyny/being strongarmed into creating a sexy female character, even after she explicitly stated her reasons for creating said character; where somehow more than one person agrees when it's said that Chris Pratt having a suntan for Jurassic World was racist; and the only reason not to like a movie full of tired cliches is somehow sexism. (That said, we also live in a wonderful time where Laura Croft looks like a human being, a Native American in a western is actually played by a Native American, and an in-comic statement about the \"world not being ready for a black Captain America\" a few decades back was proven unequivocally false when fandom was more supportive of that then they'd been when Cap was replaced by a white guy only a few years before. The two things are related, I'm sure, but the discourse is very strange and somewhat disturbing in its extremism.)\n\nIf you genuinely think that the disclaimer's wording, focusing on one abhorrent behavior in a franchise that PRIDES itself on abhorrent behavior, is meant to ask people not to be dicks, I have a bridge to sell you. It is very specifically defending their choice to USE the language and depict the behavior. They are asking people to forgive them for writing it in, not asking anyone to critically think and evaluate it. Or the people who wrote it are terrible at English and didn't pay attention when their teachers were explaining word choice for intent.","score":"-8","subreddit":"gaming"}

{"body":"I have a few favorites;\n\nThe relevant one to the topic is: Sithis (yes, Dark Brotherhood's Sithis) birthed/created Lorkhan, and instructed Lorkhan to rally the other godlike entities and create Mundus. After the fact, and even during the creation, the other godlike beings realized the power they were expending on this project was being permanently drained from them. Those who saw it in time left, diminished but still immortal. Magnus was the first to notice, and got the hell out of dodge long before anyone else, punching the hole into aetherius that is the Sun. Those who came after him made the stars and constellations. Anyone left who continued the work became mortal, or even died on the spot because of the power drain. Many of these beings were wrathful that Lorkhan had convinced them to do such a devastating thing, and turned on him, slaying him. His corpse became the moons. Those left on Mundus who had turned mortal had no means of escape, and went on to be the ancestors of all Elvenkind. All of these entities that aided in the creation of Mundus (from Lorkhan and the ones who left, to the Mortals who literally gave birth) are considered the ancestors of creation, or \"Aedra\". Those who refused to help in the creation are Not Ancestors, or \"Daedra\".\n\nMy most favorite, though, is the concept of the Dragon Break. There are events and beings/constructs throughout history that are/were so incredibly powerful that the flow of Time itself on Nirn broke under the stress. Akatosh being represented by a Dragon, and being the god of Time, these events were dubbed Dragon Breaks. While time is broken, Nirn experiences multiple parallel universe timelines. One of the most notable ones is the one caused by the player character in Daggerfall, called the Warp in the West. The Brass-God Numidium (actually a machine, like a giant mecha of sorts) was being reassembled in the Iliac bay area near High Rock and Hammerfell. The player is tasked by several different NPCs to gather the tools necessary to activate the Numidium, each NPC wanting its power for themselves. They were: each of the rulers in the bay area, the necromancer Mannimarco, a Super-Lich known as the UnderKing, and Emperor Tiber Septim. Because of the Dragon Break, all of them were simultaneously able to gain control of this Totem/Activation device in their own separate timelines. Each of the local rulers would use it to decimate the others' armies and take over the bay area, Mannimarco just absorbed the totem to ascend to god-like power, The Underking used the totem to basically Self-Destruct the Numidium so he could finally die, and Tiber Septim used the Numidium to wrest control over the entirety of Tamriel, finally uniting everyone under one Empire and starting the 3rd era. \n\nNow, when Akatosh is finally able to regain control of things and start fixing the Dragon Break, there are several timelines that all could technically be correct. He can't just choose one. So when he restores the flow of time, they all collapse into each other, simultaneously becoming 'true'. The result of this in the Warp in the West is that all timelines became reality - all of the city-state rulers had been wiped out except the 4 main Kings/Queens of Sentinel, Wayrest, Daggerfall, and Orsinium, who now swore fealty to Emperor Septim, the Numidium was destroyed, and Mannimarco disappeared (presumably to another realm).\n\nMany times this is what makes the events contained in lore books in-game have conflicting records. They are entirely true perspectives of those who wrote the books, but they directly conflict with each other because they came from different timelines. Additionally, a side effect of collapsing parallel timelines into each other is that everyone who is not of god-like power immediately starts to forget the events they experienced during the Dragon Break. So, the Morrowind Tribunal is able to remember each of the different timelines of the Dragon Break, but any 'mere mortal' would have their conflicting memories start to cancel each other out.","score":"22","subreddit":"skyrim"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; I'm just wondering how can a Space Marine commit an act of dishonor\n\nIt's probably better to think of Space Marines as enhanced Spec-Ops soldiers (like the US Navy SEALs or the Israeli Mossad) than as something entirely separate from mankind, at least starting out in the lore. On average, perhaps the last person to do anything to harm their nation would be a Spec-Ops soldier, but for all their training and dedication they aren't perfect, and they can fall victim to pride, or just terrible circumstances and fail in their tasks. And if there's one thing that 40k has, it's lots of terrible circumstances.\n\nSo when a human is made a Space Marine, they're implanted with specialized organs (chiefly the gene seed of their Legion or Chapter, but also several other organs), and information about the Imperium and battle tactics is uploaded directly into their minds. They're also heavily conditioned through those uploads and rigorous training sessions, primarily to not feel fear on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, for all of this they are still at least somewhat human and fall victim to just about every human psychological failing (the one possible exception being cowardice). The Horus Heresy, perhaps the most important event in the setting involves a huge number of Space Marines -- and the founders of their respective legions, called primarchs -- falling victim to various psychological pitfalls and rebelling against the Imperium. \n\nTo compound all of this, in the \"present day\" (ie the late 41^st Millenium) there's a strong religious component to the entire Imperium's service to the Emperor (who is treated like a god, and probably for good reason). This means that something as simple as not being fanatically devoted enough is cause for dishonor, and tends to cause members of the Imperium to assume they are inadequate, whether or not it is the case.\n\nSo a Space Marine discovering a Chaos Cult might think he's dishonored himself by taking a tenth of a second to start killing heretics instead of doing so instantly. That's kind of an exaggeration, but that's the mindset they're in.\n\n\u0026gt; Or am I wrong and that's just subjective and situational really?\n\nIn general you're not wrong. Outside of the Heresy, large-scale failures by the Space Marines are almost unheard-of, and mass defection is a very uncommon and very noteworthy thing. But it's a mistake to think of Space Marines as unable to do wrong, and one of the major themes, at least in the fluff that I've read, is exploring -- for all of their augmentations and training -- how very human Space Marines still are after their conversion.","score":"14","subreddit":"40kLore"}

{"body":"Lots of wrongness in this (full report which he cites at the bottom, which I will pick apart here and by extension will debunk the OP), and vaguness and evidence of a lack of knowledge of the field of gravitation including facts and terminology.\n\n* The idea of gravitational field as a refractive index is not really a popular or useful notion.  It doesn't tell you anything useful and is not something I've ever heard from cosmologists or astrophysicists.\n\n* Talking about the polarizable vacuum model of gravity is already points off since a.) we know GR works better than ever thanks to gravitational wave observations, b) the idea itself is nonsense as I'm sure has been pointed out here before.\n\n* Dealing with 1 space and 1 time dimension is not usually called \"two dimensions\" in Relativity, it's usually referred to as \"1+1 dimensions\"\n\n* His definition of refractive index is almost completely arbitrary.  Since he (re)defines it as the ratio of the root of the metric elements (which is not the same as some fraction of the speed of light) done in a flat spacetime, which he says he's working in, the metric should be the Minkowski metric.  This is all 1 along the diagonal (except the 00 component, the signs depend on whether you use the East or West Coast metric).  This means his refractive index K should always be 1 - i.e. no refractive index (or a vacuum one).  Nor does he talk about any sort of perturbation to the Minkowski metric, or even mentions the Minkowski metric for flat spacetime.  That's a red flag.  He also doesn't even bother to mention other metrics commonly learned in a basic GR class, like the Schwarzchild metric.\n\n* By talking about the speed of light and \"refractive index\" around some spacetime, he seems to be trying to reinvent gravitational lensing, or aspects of it.  This is already well described in GR.\n\n* He talks about the zero point field, but doesn't actually define it, or say what he thinks it is.  Since he claims he's talking about QED this should be particularly relevant.\n\n* He brings out the tired and continuously debunked notion that one can absorb energy from the vacuum state.  You cannot.  It is not a free energy source.  Then immediately cites Putoff, the founder of Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED).  This was an idea that has a little interest in the mid 90s but quickly died out, especially since more precise tests of QED have been done and the theory holds up fantastically.\n\n* He says equations from QED will be used then goes into SED.  Which is unfounded, and another big red flag.\n\n* He claims electrons have a natural frequency.  They do not.\n\n* He calls his equations 14-16 (in the full report) fluctuations, but they are not really.  They are just expectation values of some things he's claiming are measurable.\n\n* He claims his expectation values for position, velocity and acceleration connect quantum mechanics to gravity.  They do not.  They can be defined in quantum mechanics and have no connection to gravity whatsoever.\n\n* He introduces a damping factor and claims the power radiated from a charged particle is damped and that one can interpret this as a curvature in spacetime (or connected to it).  Aside from his calculations being based a a more or less debunked (and more or less relegated to crackpot land) theory - SED, this is sort of irrelevant.  Speaking quite generally and broadly, any non-zero energy in GR can curve spacetime.  It will come into the T^00 component of the stress-energy tensor in GR.  For example, could you talk about on person standing on a bed using the formalism of GR?  Yes.  But it won't tell you anything new or interesting since the effects of GR will be so small they will be completely negligible.\n\n* He also asserts from this damping of power that the speed of light will change (assuming you're in the vacuum of space) due to eqn. 21.  It will not.  This would violate one of the postulates of Relativity.  He just gets this idea from his ad hoc equation for power scaled by a factor of his \"refractive index\".  In fact something this profound would have been measured already from the many telescopes and lab tests we have done.\n\n* He goes on to claim that his equations are consistent with GR but does no calculations in GR or quotes any results.  What's worse is that he wanted to talk about the quantum harmonic oscillator but didn't even bother to quote any results from that (except for the ground state energy), which you could have taken from an undergraduate text on QM.  \n\n* His connection between QM and gravity is simply that a \"refractive index\" that he dubiously defines using a flat (supposedly) metric is connected with a harmonic oscillator that radiates and is damped.  It is this damping which he uses to try and draw similarities with GR (again without actually providing any concrete motivation).  This is more like reasoning by analogy than it is a serious theory on quantum gravity.  Nothing about the well tested theories of QED or GR really come in and he uses a debunked theory to do it all.\n\n* Even worse he brings out the tired and wrong idea that the zero point field can be used to extract power.  It cannot.\n\n* He also claims to explain why gravity have a negative energy density (it doesn't in all practical and physically realizable scenarios, and he doesn't even do any calculations from GR to show this).\n\nI'm not going to bother with the rest.  This is based on a mountain of misunderstanding, wrong ideas, and debunked theories.","score":"28","subreddit":"EmDrive"}

And it didn't even seem like a failure because the reason for their breakup was pretty stupid (which Jess explained to the audience at the season 5 finale). The reason for breaking up, that they have nothing in common, [was wrong](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent). They have the same sense of humour, they have chemistry, they often put others before them, etc. There's even an episode, S03E10 Thanksgiving, where Nick freaked out cause they have too much in common. It's also a big theme in the show that different people can be compatible.\n\nI have a feeling that the writers broke them up in season 3 so that we can have season-1 style shenanigans again minus the pressure of always pushing the relationship forward. That's why season 4 and 5 seem like a return to the roots. Gang does random shit, small hint of Nick and Jess here and there, gang does more random shit. \n\n\u0026gt;have Reagan pick up the \"New Girl\" mantle\n\nPlease no.

I don't know how it's beneficial to the show to have Reagan finish her story arc if they go down that painfully predictably route of \"wow, you guys taught me that feelings are good, alright bye.\" I have no idea why this sub is in love with Reagan (her looking like Megan Fox might help explain it).\n\n\u0026gt;Zooey's character was all over the place season 5\n\nAgreed to an extent. But by the end, Jess was used nicely to set up episodes pretty well (S05E18 A Chill Day In, S05E15 Jeff Day, S05E19 Dress). The show can't work without her. I guarantee you that if season 5 didn't have Jess' return, the show would just feel empty, and the rest of the characters would have to crank up their quirks to 11 to almost make up for it. And that would either get old *fast*, or it wouldn't be the same show. Too much to risk.\n\nThe re-introduction of Sam was admittedly odd at first. I think his storyline in season 5 was used as a parallel to Jess for the whole \"I'm actually in love with my best friend\" thing. In season 2, that was exactly what his character was for.\n\nI have a feeling Jess will have some growing up to do in season 6. \n\nTL;DR Nick and Jess are endgame, bro","score":"48","subreddit":"NewGirl"}

{"body":"Baryonic mass is all the \"normal\" particles that we're used to: protons, neutrons, electrons, positrons, anti-protons, etc. What the quote is saying is that if you tally up all the mass visually of the bullet cluster and find it's center of mass you find it at, say, point a. But if you use a different method like the effects of gravitational lensing to estimate the center of mass, you find its at a different spot, point b. The way we reconcile this currently is by using computer models to estimate additional mass surrounding the bullet cluster which we think is dark matter. \n\nThis is the main argument against MOND. Since MOND only tallies up baryonic matter, you have to figure out why the bullet cluster seems to have a different center of mass than it should.  \n\nEdit: Sorry, the first way they estimate the mass center of the bullet cluster isn't visually. They do it by measuring the velocity with which the two halves of the cluster are colliding and then using that to extrapolate the mass. \n\n\u0026gt; The major components of the cluster pair—stars, gas and the putative dark matter—behave differently during collision, allowing them to be studied separately.\n\nSo you observe all the different baryonic components by separating them by velocity and use that to estimate the total mass and then measure the center of mass.

I'm white, he's indigenous. My parents had seen him on the news the night before, saying that marijuana legalisation wasn't necessarily a good thing. I found this surprising, as he's a very informed man, who is also a supporter of LGBT groups, women's groups, and pot seemed like a logical platform for him to support.\n\nI asked him about it, and he said (paraphrased), \"White people don't always get it with marijuana. Yes, it's OK for the majority of them to use. But when there are different socio-economic factors at play, our communities get hurt by it more than white communities.\"\n\nHis point was that where access to economic power is less, the introduction of legal marijuana is more dangerous. It's sort of like a flat tax rate: 10% of $2,000 a week hits a lot less than 10% of $400 a week. And when you introduce a drug that, while not addictive, is something that people do like to have, it cuts into the budget that they have for living. It's the same effect as alcohol. The only positive that marijuana legalisation has for poorer communities is reducing the criminal risks, but at the same time, it poses a large economic hazard to them.","score":"-4","subreddit":"atheism"}

Joseph married multiple women who were already married to living Mormon men who were in good standing in the church.

Even with his injuries, Hamhuis last season tied Gudbranson's best offensive year.\n\nDefensively, they're not nearly as bad, although the Canucks did give up the eighth-most goals in the NHL — even with decent goaltending.

Every year companies bring out their cool low yield/high price gimmick gadgets and nobody actually gets their hands on one in the end.

I would use their Taptic engine as an example. A decade of research into a feature that after more then a year, competitors are still unable to reproduce. Taptic engine is the fundamental underlying technology that will allow software buttons to click just like real buttons . But nobody talks about it on Reddit, because it doesn't stand out on Reddits clickbait /r/futureology mentality. \n\nThat said, Apple is huge now and is neglecting their existing products at an unprecedented level.

I've known several people who trying to debate and trying to explain anything just  results in whatever I'm saying sailing straight over their head.\n\nExample:\n\n\"Why do you hate the poor?!\"\n\n\"I don't. Government regulations and minimum wages are pricing firms out the market, increasing unemployment\".\n\n\"Bullshit. They need higher wages to live, you're just selfish\"\n\n\"Increasing wages artificially causes artificial inflation. You'd be boosting the minimum wage forever just to keep up.\"\n\n\"Why don't we just tax the rich more?\"\n\n\"They already shoulder over half of all taxes.\"\n\n\"And they're still rich! They can afford to pay more. The poor need the money more that rich corporations\"\n\n and on it goes...\n\n","score":"-3","subreddit":"ireland"}

{"body":"I think there are a couple of things to address in this:\n\n**Interpersonal Relationships**\n\nWhile there legitimately are toxic environments where peers may sabotage each other, I think in my opinion it's generally better to not worry about that. I think you have to reflect whether your labmates comments about you are passive-aggressive comments because they don't like you, or if they are simply making innocent jokes. I think the most important thing right now is to try to understand your labmates and make friends with them.\n\nLearning to understand and make connections with people is critical for a scientific career. You may very well be the best worker in lab, but don't forget that everybody has their times of bad results! What you need to do is make friends and connections with your labmates: These peers can be become important allies and even help you refine your ideas.\n\nI would suggest maybe trying to take steps to move from a merely \"civil\" relationship to a \"friendship\". Maybe go out to eat with them once in a while, ask them how they are doing, and ask them for honest feedback (whether it's about your project or even about your personality). I think a little honestly, humility, and transparency goes a long way in improving relationship with labmates.\n\n**Lab Technique**\n\nOn the experimental side, the reality is that we often very sure we've done something experimentally, when it could actually be our memory playing tricks on us. I'm not entirely ruling out the possibility that there is sabotage in your lab, but I think it is better to not rely on your feelings and intuitions with stuff like this. In the hundred of experiments I've done, I've learned that it always helps to overdo things so as to avoid trusting in your memory. Some suggestions:\n\n1. Prepare multiple aliquots and save your samples. If you're concerned about sabotage then you should portion out your samples to multiple locations (a primary location and a backup location for samples may help)\n\n2. Take pictures when you store your samples. This will not only help you remember where you stored your samples in the future, but you can even use it to verify if things have been shuffled around by others.\n\n3. Seal your critical samples containers with parafilm/tape and mark the seals with a sharpie/etc, whatever helps makes things less \"tamper proof\".\n\n4. Label things on multiple sides/places just to be careful.\n\n","score":"23","subreddit":"labrats"}

When you get up and go to a job at the same time five days a week, and work approximately the same hours on those days, and then have a weekend, etc. it seems fairly easy to remember.  I had a lot harder time when I worked a job that had an irregular schedule (Open some days, close some days, work 8 hours some days, work 4 hours other days, work different days each week etc.)  It was much harder.  Do you do it at noon, and then bring your pills with you wherever you go?  Annoying! I imagine the \"routine\" jobs are usually better income-wise than the \"random\" jobs. \n\nSecond, some of it is personality/ life skills.  People who are very consistent and disciplined can often raise out of poverty more easily than people less disciplined and consistent.  Not causation, not 100%, but some correlation.  \n\nThird, Education.  I'm not sure everyone actually understands \"take this at the same time every day.\"  It doesn't seem to be understood by any men in politics at least.  \n\nFourth, availability.  Gah!  Depending on your set up you might have to go to the pharamacy every month during the right 2-4 days to get your next pack.  Prior to Obamacare, that might cost you $15-$30, and you'd have to have that money at the same time as the pharmacy has your refill.  ","score":"23","subreddit":"science"}

At that point, I like to pop into the comments and see if anyone mentioned it. Posts like this have HUGE visibility to tons of potential clients, and most of them have no idea what to look for in a good tattoo. I know it sucks to have someone tell you your tattoo isn't well done, but wouldn't it suck more to get tattooed by an artist you thought was good but is actually awful?\n\nI'm not one to jump all over every little mistake. Artists are human, tiny wobbles and inconsistencies happen. But the job of the artist is to have the whole piece be good enough that your eye doesn't immediately go to the mess up. This particular tattoo is a damn mess. Every line is shaky and inconsistent, the artist should NEVER have attempted to line with a 3, which those shaky thin lace lines appear to be, and people should know that when the artist's name is advertised on their front page.\n\nYou also won't see me in here shitty on the CONTENT or STYLE of the tattoo. Personally, I think this lace line work swirly bird thing is pretty done, but that's just my taste. I don't like watercolor or tribal, but I'm not gonna jump down someone's throat for wanting it.

А вот Россия влияет больше. Поэтому европейских политиков устроит любой вариант решения российско-украинского конфликта, если тот будет в более-менее цивилизационных рамках - то есть чтобы не было геноцида и большой войны с беженцами. И вариант мирных выборов на оккупированных территориях и мирного и постепенного возврата их в правовое поле Украины для них вполне приемлемый - и овцы останутся целы, и волки будут сыты, да и повод снять санкции будет.\n\nПоэтому тут нам надо проявить жесткость в позиции по оккупированным территориям, и самим сделать шаги, показывающие и закрепляющие эту позицию:\n\n- признать и официально закрепить статус оккупированных территорий, \n- ввести визовый режим с РФ, \n- создать нормальное министерство по оккупированным территориям, \n- сделать реально действующую программу поддержки вынужденных переселенцев (кстати, возможно и с финансовой поддержкой этой программы другими государствами), \n- создать организацию по юридической поддержке пострадавших от оккупации людей в украинских и, главное, международных судах, \n- подать кучу коллективных исков к РФ от граждан Украины в международные суды, \n- подать кучу исков от государства Украины в международные политические и экономические суды,\n- принять законы о коллаборантах, \n- и в соответствии с этими законами подать иски в суд на всех коллаборантов.\n\nИ вот тогда, увидев твердость нашей позиции и серьезность наших намерений, Европа будет предлагать условия урегулирования конфликта с учетом наших интересов. А пока сейчас коллаборанты находятся в высших эшелонах власти, пока у президента Украины есть действующий бизнес в России, да и вообще весь наш крупный бизнес сотрудничает с РФ, пока Савченко орет с международной трибуны про федерализацию, а мэрами городов являются граждане РФ, европейские политики не видят смысла предпринимать какие-то принципиальные шаги в нашу пользу.","score":"30","subreddit":"ukraina"}

Mr. Modi fed the perception that India’s feckless leaders had failed to allow the country to reach its full potential. And he campaigned as the only one capable of fixing that.\n\nWhat do you say to that? The comparison I think is pretty apt.\n\n\u0026gt;“I will make such a wonderful India that all Americans will stand in line to get a visa for India,” he said once. A centerpiece of his agenda is the “Make in India” program, which is aimed at stimulating economic growth by encouraging more manufacturing in the country.\n\nSounds like a Trump-esque promise to me, something with a lot of fantasy, and no real way for it to ever actually happen.\n\n\u0026gt;“It’s all about India first, or ‘Make India Great,’ ” said Sujeeth Draksharam, a civil engineer from Houston who supports Mr. Trump and planned to attend Saturday’s event. “Look at Donald Trump. It’s the same thing. ‘Make America Great Again’ — strong again.”\n\nWell...\n\n\u0026gt;“One of the things that Modi very subtly articulated, but was very clear about, was something which nobody wanted to say,” said Subramanian Swamy, a longtime Indian politician and Hindu nationalist who is often a thorn in the side of the country’s political elite. “And that is that Hindus, despite being 80 percent of the population, feel like they got a raw deal.”\n\nHmm, have you ever talked to white male Trump supporters? It's pretty much the same idea.\n\n\u0026gt;The response, Mr. Bhagavan said — whether in India, the United States, Britain or any of the countries experiencing a convulsion of antiglobalism right now — is “let’s barricade ourselves in.”\n\n\u0026gt;“These problems are all stemming from these immigrants, these different people, so let’s get rid of them,” he said, describing the views of many nationalists. “And it’s easy answers to not such easy problems.”\n\nYeah, sounds right to me.

Corbyn is disliked for a lot of reasons, not just his policies but his past and his management style. Surely there is someone that a majority of the party believe is a better choice who preserves a position further to the left but engages with the electorate better and is less abrasive to the MPs and opposing unions.

Top that off with even the slightest bit of lag/slow connection, and you're basically running towards the things you want to pickup anyway.

{"body":"When we make the World Series some year, I don't want to share it with the rest of the world. I don't want your back slaps, your words of congratulation, and most of all, I don't want to hear you say \"I was rooting for the Cubs, man,\" because you're not. We don't need to hear about curses, about animals, and we don't want outsiders to constantly reference a certain fan who also shares our heartbreak. The rest of the baseball world is obsessed with him, but we aren't. We have a better heart, a better understanding of baseball, and a better understanding of the Cubs. It's clear to us, the rest of you will just never understand. We are obsessed with finally making the World Series. It's been almost more than a lifetime for most of the fan base to even get that far. We dream of watching those games with our father, or our brothers while trying to hold ourselves together thinking about the departed family members that introduced us to this awesome experience. With each passing year, the pain gets deeper and deeper, as our parents reach the age of 70, and our grandparents move on to a better place. This isn't a game once you reach that point. It's a memory that's taken from us, that won't ever happen. And that hurts. A lot. So if you won't stop making jokes about the team now, or laughing about its futility, please understand that when we do finally win, I won't share the moment with you. I won't be angry or treat you like you've treated us. I'll just ignore you. It's not something you will ever properly experience, and I don't want you to know how it feels. Ever. It won't change the fact that I can't give my grandpa a high five and see the look in his eyes. But that will all be part of the emotion of that moment, my moment, our moment. We are not kindred spirits with the team in Boston, we didn't share in the torment with our cohorts on the South Side, and most of all, we would never trade our experiences with the Yankees fans. As painful as it is, I love being a Cubs fan. I don't know if it will happen in my lifetime, my father's lifetime, or even my children's lifetime. I know it didn't happen in my grandpa's lifetime, and every October, that thought brings me to tears. In 2003, though, I learned a lot about being a Cubs fan from him, and in those 30 minutes after Game 7, in the depths of despair, I learned something new about my 84 year-old grandfather. For that, thank you Chicago Cubs, because the true character of a person announces itself in times of despair. If you're not a Cubs fan, you don't understand, and I don't want you to. When it does happen, don't talk to me, don't mock me, and certainly don't try to cheer with me. Don't offer words of encouragement. Because, right now, everyone is laughing and joking about memories I may never share with people that mean the most to me. That hurts. Until then, though, enjoy your jokes and your ridicule and your trite references that only outsiders find funny. The fire is brewing inside, and when it happens, I won't waste an ounce of energy on you. Instead, I'll share those moments with the people that mean the most to me.","score":"201","subreddit":"baseball"}

In the end the deck is capable of doing extremely degenerate things. It's an aggro deck because it has plans B, C, D, and so on. The deck can win through a lot of hate.

Like Elves, the decisions of which creatures to include is only slightly influenced by the other cards - cards which only give a relatively marginal advantage. If you ask yourself if the deck would 'still be a deck' if you remove one or two of the \"combo cards\" cards, and the answer is no, you are probably looking at a combo deck.

The current strength tests are not designed for the soldier. They are designed as generic strength tests and so their effectiveness in creating combat-ready individuals is fairly unknown. Further, A soldier who passes the strength tests may have other disadvantages that were not tested for and that may in-fact be more important than the strength test. In contrast, a female soldier may fail the strength test, but offer benefits which far outweigh those limits within combat and negotiation ability.\n\nThe truth is, we presume \"Soldier\" means \"Man-like\" so no wonder women don't make the cut for the most part. But the reality is that \"soldier\" has so much more aspects to it which make someone effective, many of which may outweigh the strength aspect. This is ignored. Why? Historical Sexism. If anyone thinks sexism isn't running around happily in the USA, take a look at the current Republican Nominee and his supporters.\n\nFinally, there is a simple truth to the fact that war and combat is changing.

{"body":"Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool Bill's PC ([previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing)):\n\n\n----\n\n\nThe initial setup for the Move tab is all but complete.  A handful of things remain to add to the GUI, and then it’s just a matter of hooking it up properly.  I said I was going to do that part this week, but due to needing to redesign so much of the move properties it just wasn’t ever in a solid enough state for me to formally complete it.\n\n\n----\n\n\nThis is mostly due to the creation of what I call the Aspect system.  Previously I expressed the desire to divide moves into Moves and “techniques”, and the Aspect system is the culmination of this idea.  Aspects can be thought of as sub-types: different schools of application of the usage of a particular type.  \n\n\nFor example, Psychic is divided into Telekinesis, Teleportation, Telepathy, Focus, and Shielding.  The three Ts are self-explanatory, while Shielding is things like Barrier and Focus is the use of psychic energy blasts. Each Aspect will have its own EV which is trained by using moves of that Aspect.  So, to train Focus I can spam Confusion over and over.\n\n\nBut what’s the point?  Well, through use of this system I hope to make defining move lists a thing of the past.  A move like Psybeam might be designated thusly: \n\n\n\u0026gt;Psybeam: Requires Brain.  Requires INT \u0026gt; 100 AND SPATK \u0026gt; 60.  Requires Psychic Typing \u0026gt;10%. Requires Focus \u0026gt; 200\n\n\nSo to learn Psybeam, a pokemon has to meet all of the above requirements, and it can then be taught the move.  This can either be done by Move Tutor, TM, or by telling your pokemon to “Experiment”, a mode of training that has a % chance of learning a new move based on what moves the pokemon has witnessed and their eligibility.  A new Kadabra that has never heard of Psybeam might not ever discover it through Experimentation, but one that has seen Psybeam used dozens of times by friends or foes has a good chance of figuring it out!\n\n\nSome moves can be approached by multiple types.  Thunder Punch, for instance, would look something like this:\n\n\u0026gt; Thunder Punch: Requires Arm OR Grasp tag. Requires ATK \u0026gt;80 AND SPATK \u0026gt; 40. Requires Martial \u0026gt; 50. Requires Chi + Discharge \u0026gt; 400.\n\n\nSo a pokemon could learn this move either by training the fighting Chi Aspect to 400, or the electric Discharge Aspect to 400, or by mixing some of each if it can.  Some type combinations are common enough to have their own dual-type Aspect, such as Mud being Rock/Water or Terrakinesis being Rock/Psychic, with their own tech tree to match.\n\n\nThis system is very exciting to me, as it will force move sets to be *systematic* in a way that canon pokemon is not.  Access to a move is going to be based on meeting the raw requirements and not something as arbitrary as species.  This is going to result in a lot of emergent gameplay that will no doubt result in surprises for veterans of the series. It will also remove the burden of the designer needing to manually add each move to each pokemon, which is important considering that I plan for there to be many more available moves than in canon.\n\n\n[The Aspects in their current form can be viewed here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YfTAk95UdTEtOVFmMl42spmsg3Trn2TRsnqNkFj721c/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\n----\n\n\nWhile working on these systems this week, I came to the conclusion that I am starting to get diminishing returns on prototypeless design.  So, I will be spending this next week cleaning up Bill’s PC, scrubbing up the documentation, and otherwise getting it into a solid state for the future--as by this time next week I will have begun setting up the game itself.  Bill’s PC is not complete, but for now it grants us enough capabilities to be able to start working on some bare-metal coding.\n\n\n----\n\n\nFeel free to leave any comments or questions below! Also feel free to join us [on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server](https://discord.gg/sM99CF3) for brainstorming and discussion.  It’s a great group, really, and I would highly recommend hanging out, even if you’re not in it for this project itself.  There’s tabletop groups, Dota 2 partying, and [puns](http://i.imgur.com/j3jRmMZ.png) like you wouldn’t [believe](http://i.imgur.com/8cUkzoGl.jpg).  Come join us!\n\n","score":"18","subreddit":"rational"}

In my dream, I went from running, to being dazed, on the ground, and being able to feel that I was severely injured. I remember that blood was pouring from my mouth, and that all of the teeth on my right side (the molars) had been knocked out and were resting on my tongue. I tried to get up in my dream, but my body was just not working. All I could feel was that something was very wrong, my body was no longer working, and that my molars were floating around inside my mouth on my tongue, in a pool of blood. In hindsight, it's like the right side of my face was smashed in, in this dream.\n\nI immediately woke, and grabbed the right side of my face. All is there. Okay, just a dream. Look at the clock, will I get a little bit more rest before I go run? Nope, it's 5:21 am; I've overslept by a minute. Time to put on my shoes and run. But now my 2 year old daughter is crying, and screaming \"Daddy\" over and over in the next room. Shit. So I go pick her up to calm her down, but she just wants to hug me and won't let go. Given my odd dream, and now the problem of having to put my daughter back down to sleep, I decide that today is not going to be a day I run.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, my daughter falls back to sleep (in my arms, in my room, in our bed) and the power goes out.\n\nFast forward just a few hours, I'm on my way to work and wouldn't you fucking know it, but somebody driving their truck lost control, ran off the road, and took out a power pole along my running path. Had I been out on my usual morning run, I would have been very close to that area around the time the accident happened.\n\nI know the odds are ridiculous; timing would have had to been perfect, etc. for the truck to hit me IRL, but I was sort of freaked out about the whole thing. Actually, when I drove past and saw the accident, I was screaming over and over, \"WHAT THE FUCK?!? over and over, in an excited way. I mean, did my dream warn me about impending death, and the combination of my bad dream and my daughter's nightmare prevent this from happening in real life?\n\nTL;DR - dreamed about getting hit by something while running; daughter wakes up at the same time screaming preventing me from actually going running; find out later that a truck hit a power pole along my running path that morning.","score":"644","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

Then lower the car, break the lug nut free, and then repeat for any other stuck lug nuts.  \n\nSo this can be a hassle, and it can take time, but it is safe and doesn't require having a breaker bar, cheater pipe, or any other non-standard tools.","score":"14","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

Even the most impoverished of Westerners are a hundred times better off than their third world counterparts. People like to say - LOOK - proof that capitalism is a good thing! \n\nThose benefits don't come from nowhere. Western states engage in global capitalist imperialism. We export capital resources to the third world and import super cheap labor. This is why some workers in the West aren't exploited, but actually paid MORE than the value of their labor - labor aristocracy.

There are many places you can draw the line, depending on what you prioritize some cultures are more or less like others. In some ways cultures can be very similar to a western sub-culture even if they are starkly, boderline mind-numbingly, different in other ways.\n\n\nTo bring back up the Appalachian region. It is not a region that is talked about, many people don't realize how bad and how HARD life is there or how truly poor it is. Corruption runs incredibly rampant, buying your way out of trouble is strikingly common. Vote buying still runs pretty rampant there. The poverty is crushing (as are drugs now), like starvation level poverty. I already addressed the strange forms of Christianity in another post, but speaking-in-tongues and the handling of poisonous snakes are fundamental to the region. Additionally, the clannishness and distrust of outsiders isolates the region even more. The region is so remarkably isolated (that is changing and smoothing out some of the differences) that one holler actually had people who developed blue skin (methemeoglobemia). You mention toilets, in this region, outhouses are not uncommon and getting water from a well in the rural areas is still alive and well. The point being, while parts of their culture might be western, so much of it is either antiquated or entirely foreign to modern western culture that they more or less have their own independent culture. About the only thing shared is the written language and some food similarities, the spoken language is in such a strong regional dialect that the people in the REALLY rural areas might as well be speaking a foreign language.

One of my best friends at the time was a child prodigy classical pianist. Been playing since he was about 3 years old. By the time i first moved into the neighborhood, he had been at it for around 4 years. He could play it all. Bethoven, brahms, bach, mozart, etc. You name it. He had 2 pianos in his home. An upright piano (which he never really bothered with that i can recall) and a beautiful baby grand Baldwin piano (which he played every day of the week)\n\nQuite frankly, back then classical music, piano music, bored me to tears. My childlike interests were the usual things: movies, tv shows, cartoons, comic books, toys, etc. My friends talent didnt impress me in the least. While the adults around us were quite overwhelmed at this young kid who could play classical music on the piano quite well, to me it rolled off my back. \n\nOne day i came over his house and his older sister was giving a piano lesson to one of the kids in the neighborhood. My friend explained to me that the kids parents couldnt afford piano lessons so his sister was teaching the kid for free. Then my friend offered to teach me to play piano for free too but since the piano and classical music bored me, like the major league IDIOT i was, i turned down his offer. Years later i would come to regret that. \n\nToday my friend is an internationally renowned classical pianist. A few years ago i learned that his fee for private piano lessons was 150 bucks an hour. Its probably higher today. \n\nSo if i were to relive one day in my life over and over, it would be that day where my friend offered to teach me to play the piano and instead of saying no, i would say yes. And like in the movie, take those piano lessons over and over and over until i became a fantastic classical pianist.\n\nTL;DR: to relive the day my classical pianist friend offered to give me free piano lessons\n\n","score":"116","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

Also its really admirable that you were able to attend your senior year of high school while supposedly being the head chef of a fine dining restaurant.\n\nEdit 2: Apparently in the time it took to read through post history my post got downvoted by a bunch of gullible folks. You can read the same stuff I did and see if you still believe it.\n\nEdit 3: Ok after reading a bit more my final advice to the op would be to delete every comment you've ever made, because you have a bit much posted there for your actual line of work, which is no longer being the head chef of a fine dining restaurant, by the way.","score":"132","subreddit":"AskReddit"}

{"body":"TL;DR:  For good reasons, they are not going to do this.\n\nHonestly, I think the best solution is to allow separate key bindings for separate channels.  If I want to open mic in group and PTT in team, I should be able to do that.  If I want PTT in group bound to one key, and PTT in team bound to another, I should be able to do that.  \n\nBut I certainly do not want the game unilaterally deciding to open my mic to the public.  Bind it to a PTT key?  Fine.  Ask me if I'm okay with changing channels?  Fine.  Taking me from a private channel to a public one automatically?  No thank you.\n\nI think the community (perhaps just a vocal minority) is being shortsighted about this whole issue.  Of course I want people to participate in team chat, but it's not always going to happen, and that's okay.  If you get that bent out of shape about people not being on comms in comp, try to find some like-minded people to group with.  It's really not that hard, I promise - my Battle.net friends list has ballooned with good players that talk on mic because we recognize and prefer those traits.

She said that he has touched her, but she didn't think it was wrong because he said it was okay.\n\nI am so overwhelmed by so many emotions right now. I thought of my son as a good, caring, sweet kid. We're really close, he's my only child, and he's my world. I had him really young (I was 15) and I was forced to grow up really fast. As was his father, who was 18 at the time. Please, I beg you, to keep all of the negative comments to yourself. I understand why you guys would feel that way but I am really hurting right now as so is everyone involved and those just aren't helpful to the situation. I know what he did was wrong, and I think he deserves the repercussions that will follow, but I am not giving up on him. I feel that would do more harm than good. \n\nWe had his grandmother pick him up from school today. He is going to stay with her until we figure out living arrangements / what is going to happen. Our first priority is making sure the girls are safe and that he isn't around any other kids. Our second priority is approaching this in a way to try to find out if he was molested himself, and finding out who did that if it did happen. Because if it was another family member, more people could be hurt, or might have been already. Than I want to get him help.\n\nI am thinking that my boyfriends niece could probably live with her grandma for now, but that will be a process. Than he could live with us, and not be around the people he hurt.\n\nThis will change a lot in our lives as we are very close to many friends with young children. Obviously I wouldn't trust him around them, so I am trying to figure out the best way to tell people. I would only want to tell people who I feel deserved to know. I will obviously need to explain to friends why I don't want my son around their children, and also let them know so they can maybe have someone talk to the kids he has been around to make sure that nothing has happened to them. I can't think of an instance to where he would of been alone with them for any extended period of time, but when you're not looking for something it's easy for it to slip by you or be written off as something else.","score":"22","subreddit":"Parenting"}

Hillary took a $10 million bribe from the Saudis, and the FBI was \"willfully ignorant\", \"obstructed justice\", and was \"criminally negligent\".\n\nThey knew Osama Bin Laden had nothing to do with the 911 inside job, but deliberately remained silent. Over the 15 years that Hillary remained silent the Saudis donated over $100 million to the Clinton Foundaton.  This is all factual information taken from 3 Canadian court cases surrounding the fake extradition of whistle blower Bruce Gorcyca who together with Wheeler were going to expose everything before Wheeler's body was found in a dump less than a week after telling someone he had recorded a telephone call with SoS Hillary Clinton. When they found his body he was still wearing his gold watch and West Point gold ring.\n\nTo this very day the FBI admits they had no evidence that Bin Laden had anything to do with 911. He could have been captured alive but Obama ordered the seals to kill him dead. (As documented by Seymour Hersh). Why? So Obama could not have a real trial where he could tell all he knew about CIA blacks ops. http://www.democracynow.org/2015/5/12/seymour_hersh_details_explosive_story_on. It is no secret that Bin Laden worked for and was trained by the CIA for at least 10 years, and George Bush Sr.was business partners with the Bin Laden family as well as Saddam Hussein in various oil deals. Read read the book by U.S. Army General called IMMACULATE DECEPTION - INSIDE THE BUSH CRIME FAMILY.\n\nLastly, The FBI was not able to confirm Bin Laden's fingerprints were his aboard the Navy ship that dumped him in the ocean so his body could not be examined by civilian coroners back in the U.S.  Snowden now insists that Bin Laden was not in fact killed.

Just imagine if that was Martial on the end of it. Imagine it was someone like Neymar who would have no trouble crying out and falling on the floor holding his face. (Which brings up another issue for another day, that a lot of the time play acting is genuinely rewarded. It's like it draws the refs attention to what has happened and he thinks \"oh shit, I'm gonna have to address this now\". Should be red regardless of the players reaction on the receiving end). \n\nAnyways, back to the Fellaini thing. Even in general play, the amount of times players just run straight into him and go down just because he's much bigger than them. Happens a lot in the middle of the pitch, a player throws themselves in to get a semi-loose ball that Fellaini was always going to get to first. Fellaini just dribbles away with the ball and some guy just bounces his chest off his hip and goes sprawling to the ground. Might even look sore, but Fellaini as done literally nothing wrong, not his fault he's so big and players just bounce off him when they try to fly into tackles on him. There was a pretty good example of this a few weeks ago that I'm struggling to remember the specifics on, but the other player went down holding his face after he basically just kamikazed himself into Fellaini.

{"body":"[Here's a thread on the subject from last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5205xf/fact_a_young_hillary_rodham_was_fired_from_her/):\n\n\u0026gt;Infographic: **A 27 year old staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation, Hillary Rodham was fired by her supervisor, lifelong Democrat Jerry Zeifman.** [Picture of Zeifman with the young Hillary Rodham] **When asked why Hillary Rodham was fired, Zeifman said in an interview, \"Because she was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.\"**\n\nIn 1999, Jerry Zeifman wrote an article published in the New York Post about his interactions with Hillary Rodham.  The Zeifman piece is archived here: http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg20964.html\n\nHere is how Zeifman summed things up:\n\n\u0026gt;During my 14-year tenure with the House Judiciary Committee, I had supervisory authority over several hundred staff members. With the exception of Ms. Rodham, Doar and Nussbaum, I recommend all of them for future positions of public and private trust.\n\n**Note**: Zeifman was in charge of the House Judiciary Committee for 14 years.  That makes Zeifman a wicked smart lawyer.  No one gets that high up the greasy pole, or stays there that long, without being wicked smart, both with respect to law *and* politics.  \n\nIn 2008, upon the occasion of Hillary running for President, Zeifman wrote a piece about her titled [*Hillary's Crocodile Tears in Connecticut*](http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_jerry_ze_080325_1974_3a_hillary_lost_j.htm).  Here are the first two paragraphs:\n\u0026gt;I have just seen Hillary Clinton and her former Yale law professor both in tears at a campaign rally here in my home state of Connecticut. Her tearful professor said how proud he was that his former student was likely to become our next President. Hillary responded in tears. \n\n\u0026gt;My own reaction was of regret that, **when I** ***terminated her employment*** **on the Nixon impeachment staff**, I had not reported her unethical practices to the appropriate bar associations.\n\nZeifman then explains that\n\u0026gt;At the time of Watergate **I had overall supervisory authority over the House Judiciary Committee's Impeachment Inquiry staff** that included Hillary Rodham.\n\nSo *of course* Zeifman could fire Hillary for cause in light of her serious ethical breaches (boy was she a piece of work, even then).  **Zeifman was General Counsel** (i.e., top legal dog) **of the House Judiciary Committee**. As such, he had the power to hire and fire lawyers who worked for the Committee or any subcommittee like the \"Impeachment Inquiry staff,\" where Hillary worked.  **CTR types who \"helpfully\" explain that Zeifman didn't have the authority to fire Hillary** ***are just making shit up***.\n\nFurther, and importantly:\n\u0026gt;During that period I kept a private diary of the behind the scenes congressional activities.\n\n\u0026gt;In my diary of August 12, 1974 I noted the following: \n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\"John Labovitz apologized to me for the fact that months ago he and **Hillary had lied to me** [to conceal rules changes and dilatory tactics.] \n\n\u0026gt;At that time Hillary Rodham was 27 years old.\n\n[In 2008, Zeifman also was interviewed about the subject of Hillary and Watergate](http://www.westernjournalism.com/hillary-clinton-fired-for-lies-unethical-behavior/):\n\n\u0026gt;Jerry Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 27-year-old Hillary Rodham on the committee... **When the investigation was over, Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff** and refused to give her a letter of recommendation – one of only three people who earned that dubious distinction in Zeifman’s 17-year career.\n\n\u0026gt;Why?\n\n\u0026gt;**“Because she was a liar,” Zeifman said in an interview last week. “She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer.** She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality.”","score":"67","subreddit":"The_Donald"}

{"body":"I'm not the most experienced miniatures / wargame gamer but this far I've liked the **X-Wing** miniatures game the most. It's so easy to start playing and the playtime is reasonable. Unlike many other miniatures game, you don't have to spend a lot of time on preparations but you still do have lots of customisation options and \"army\" building. Star Wars: Armada was even better rule wise but the setup time killed it for me and I changed it to X-Wing. Also the starting cost for X-Wing is pretty low compared to many other games.\n\nRecently I got to try **Guild Ball** and really liked it. I guess I like the games where you don't have to build large armies / battalions and have less dice chucking and book keeping. In Guild Ball I liked that you can also win by making goals and not only by defeating the other team in combat.\n\n**RuneWars: The Miniatures Game** looks interesting but I find the world of Terrinoth a bit boring / generic. Otherwise the game looks like a fresh take on Warhammer Fantasy Battle with less clunky gameplay. I'm not too tempted to buy it though as I already have **BattleLore 2nd edition** which is more streamlined and works better for me. I really like the command and colors system it uses.\n\nIt would be easier to recommend something if you can give more information. Are you interested in assembling and painting the miniatures or do you prefer pre-painted minis? Do you like fantasy, sci-fi or historical theme? Do you have any plans for competitive playing / tournaments or just casual playing?","score":"16","subreddit":"boardgames"}

{"body":"Honestly, there are widespread misconceptions about our firearms laws in all walks of life, other than the people who spend huge amounts of their day reading up about them.  \n\nAnyway, the reasoning for the broad exemptions for police are pretty straightforward:\n\n* The police often are required to deal with firearms in fashions that aren't in keeping with the Criminal Code.  For example, an officer who seizes a handgun from a suspect may not have a trigger lock and a locking case, but may still need to get the firearm back to the evidence lockup.  He probably also doesn't have time to sit around and wait for an ATT.  \n\n* Most of the stuff in the PAL/RPAL course is inapplicable to the average officer in terms of their duty weapons, and the bits that are are more efficiently taught in police training.\n\n* The PAL/RPAL course is NOT a suitable course in the legalities of firearms ownership, beyond some very bare basics in terms of storage.  \n\nAnd so on.

{"body":"I'm enthusiastically seconding the menstrual cup recommendation. Much more comfortable, and incredibly more effective. The quality of sleep I get with a menstrual cup (as opposed to a pad) is immensely better. That, and many menstrual pads cause irritation or rashes to the skin down there. I've only found one brand that hasn't done that to me - but for about a decade before that, I thought the irritation was normal, as it had just always happened to me. Menstrual cups are also much more effective at containing everything. I haven't had to wash out much blood stains since switching to the cup, which I used to have to do monthly with pads (the premium name brand kind with wings, too, not just the cheap store brand kind.). I couldn't be happier with my menstrual cup.\n\n\nMenstrual cups are also only about $30 - and can last you many years (some women have been using their cups for 10 years and claim that they're still holding up well.) Pads are expensive - and most of them just end up in a landfill somewhere. Given the immense improvement to my quality of life after getting this cup, I'd easily pay several hundreds of dollars for it if that's how much they went for. 1/4 of my post-pubescent, pre-menopausal life is spent menstruating, and is no longer an uncomfortable, miserable hell thanks to my cup. \n\n\nAnother alternative is cloth pads, which were what women all around the world used to use before the recent/modern advent of disposable paper pads. You can sew your own or buy them online, and imo they're much more comfortable (and less chafy/irritating) than paper pads, not to mention cheaper and more environmentally friendly. \n\n\n\u0026gt;Wear bralettes or bras without padding and wires. The former two are a huge source of breast cancer and almost no one is aware of this\n\n\nBras in general have been suspected as potentially causing breast cancer, because even the ones without pads or wires are still very restrictive. The carcinogenic mechanism of action has been described as hindering or blocking proper lymph drainage from the axial lymph nodes (aka lymph nodes in your armpits) which is one of the areas checked in manual breast exams because cancer cells from the breast will often end up there. Lymph nodes are part of your immune system, and improper lymph flow can prevent cancer cells from being properly recognized/identified by your immune system (and therefore not properly handled.) \n\n\nYes, there's a big stigma about being braless, but there are many ways you can get around it, like nipple stickers or wearing multiple layers. I'll wear two layers in the summer to hide my braless-ness. It does get hot, but I prefer being too hot to not giving myself cancer and having half of my lung capacity (which contributes to fatigue and an overall sense of discomfort. It feels TERRIBLE.) Also, remembering that men also have nipples and that it's not the end of the world if people see your nipples also helps. \n\n\nI'll still wear bras occasionally to formal events like weddings and funerals if needed, but often you can find clothes/dresses that'll conceal your lack of a bra very well.\n\n\n\u0026gt;Switch to a deodorant without Aluminum.\n\n\n\nMany people who stop using conventional anti-perspirant report that when they stop using deodorant, they sweat less. I didn't ever really sweat much, but would still apply anti-perspirant daily just because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. I realized it was a waste because I don't really sweat anyway, and I also read about the detrimental health effects of aluminum in anti-perspirants. I stopped using anti-perspirant about 3 years ago, and I realized that I stopped sweating as often, even in situations that would've made me previously sweat. I've asked my friends and fiance to sniff test me - and they don't notice a difference. I highly recommend at least dialing back on the amount that you use. Your body will likely adjust accordingly. If that's not an option - do note that there's a difference between deodorant and anti-perspirant. Anti-perspirant contains aluminum to stop you from sweating, but the aluminum can build up in your body over time. Deodorant (without anti-perspirant) is basically fragrance for your armpits. It tries to mask the smell for when you do sweat, but doesn't stop you from sweating. Still not as great for you as not using anything at all and letting your body adjust - but possibly less detrimental than anti-perspirant's aluminum. \n\n\n\n","score":"18","subreddit":"conspiracy"}

Not that your domestic situation (which is bad, make no mistake) makes it okay to feel up another woman, but considering everything you're going through, what you did was **100 percent** understandable and excusable. \n\nThings got no further than some grabass. A lot of people do much worse and don't even feel bad about it. You're a standup guy; I can tell you care about your wife a great deal. \n\nFor that same reason, and for your own sanity, **do not tell her about what happened**, if you happen to be considering it. Many years ago, I learned the hard way that YES, there are *absolutely* instances in life where the people you care for must be spared the truth (as fucked up as it sounds). In other words, it's okay not to tell her about this (unless the behavior continues and you have no intention of stopping it, in which case you're in a much different situation).\n\nDo what others here are telling you and get therapy. It may not work out with your wife. And there's a possibility it *should not* work out. But you both need help and healing. Best of luck. \n\nEDIT: Don't know why I'm getting downvoted. Is it my advice not to tell his wife? She is in absolutely no state of mind to deal with the truth right now. Telling her will only make matters worse and is simply not constructive in any way at this point. ","score":"-10","subreddit":"offmychest"}

{"body":"I'm disappointed with it.\n\n**The pacing is abysmal- and much of it is thanks to editing.**\n\nThe show likes to flirt with extensive dialogue scenes, many times not revealing anything new about characters, but to deliver padding and information we already know. It's kind of like watching House of Cards, except without the element of powerplay, tension, or political/social commentary (unless comic-book corruption is somehow a new idea for you). Entire episodes are devoted to background stories, and some exposition is dragged out twice as long as it needs to be. A few episodes even stoop as low to re-use clips. Painful amounts of time are devoted to side characters as well. In many ways, I believe the Wire was an inspiration for the show, but the side characters just aren't developed or interesting enough to hold water for as long as the show tries to push them.\n\n**The fighting is terrible.**\n\nNot sure if this is the fault of the choreography or the actor, but the fight scenes are some of the worst I've seen in a comic book series. Yes, Luke's Powers are cool- but the show is banking on the allure of the power alone to be interesting. He's thrown another guy off his back? Oh, he's doing that Superman walk again where bullets are bouncing off of him. Okay, he threw something kinda heavy. In terms of actual fighting, the hero \u0026amp; the thugs do a poor job of actually keeping combat as enjoyable as it should be. You're not going to see anything close to Iron Fist here. Nothing acrobatic or agile like Spiderman or Batman. Daredevil, a hero who is clearly outclassed in terms of strength, has more visceral fight scenes- and that is saying something.\n\n**The villain is greatly portrayed, but is no Fisk.**\n\nIf you've watched Daredevil, then you should know that Cottonmouth doesn't hold a candle to Kingpin, both as a character and as a villain. Fisk held an entire city under his thumb, had an incredibly messed up backstory, weird social ticks and idealisms, and practically towered over people. Stokes just... he's not even the biggest threat in Harlem. He's overshadowed by other gangs, relies on his partner for support, can't match Luke Cage physically or even mentally, and has zero intimidation factor. Fisk NEVER allowed someone to disrespect him to his face, not without severe consequences that would ruin their life (in addition to ending it). Stokes doesn't seem dangerous because he's too grounded and he's never given a real chance by the show- which is a shame, because the actor does a good job with what he's given.\n\n**The show is a decent time killer, but I can't say it's a great comic book show.**\n\nIt's weird that I would actually recommend almost any other series out there, even Arrow, over this show. It just doesn't have much going for it. A lot of it reminds me of the movie Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. If you know what I'm talking about, then you should know what to expect of this series. If you can't be absorbed into the theme or main character's potential, then you are pretty much sunk on it as a whole.","score":"68","subreddit":"television"}

Especially so when it comes to formats like modern with a lot of deck manipulation.\n\nThe biggest mechanic is scrying, which is looking at the top X cards of your deck and reordering them or putting them on the bottom of your deck. You even get a free scry if you mulligan down from 7 cards. That being said getting mana screwed does happen, and it sucks. Its nowhere near as obnoxious as something like the old tuskarr or yogg though.\n\nAnother thing people don't think about is how much consistent mana contributes to curvestone.

It should be based on either my own discoveries or use the intergalactic internet (!!!!) and use other people's discoveries when I visit planets that have been claimed and named before. Waypoints and navigation system to reach them should also be implemented.\n\n3. I loved that part when Sean Murray demonstrated that two faction were at war on a system and you could take sides... I'd love to see that being implemented. Things like that would make the game much more alive and realistic.\n\n4. A Real piloting system. If I crash, I crash. If I burn during reentry, I burn during reentry... I just need to be able to fly very close to the ground if I want. what's with the flight assistant?\n\n5. Real ship interiors and maybe even the ability to have staff on bigger ships. I love that Rodina Style.\n\n6. I don't mind that I can't see the players if I'm online at the same time and happen to be on the same spot. The immensity of the universe is unmeasurable and we can't expect to ever meet other people. Sean Murray was right about that so in the rare cases that this might happen, I don't believe it's worth it to waste time developing and supporting the feature. However, It would be nice to be able to see tracks left by other people. Like stuff they have created (using the crafting system -see nr.1-). Or see that the resources they have mined are ... well missing... All that needs is to be sharing the progress files on a central server and download the xml files whenever you visit an already discovered world. Shouldn't be that hard and it would make such an interesting thing to visit discovered systems!\n\n7. 3rd person view. Clothes - gender - weapons and general look... I will go as far as say that guys as time goes by should grow beards and women grow hair. You need to get a hair cut or save every once in a while.\n\n8. FOOD!!! You should need to eat and Rest in a survival game! It's a survival game... Hunger should also kill you. Not only toxic planets!\n\n9. Better galactic map and waypoint system with notes. We need to be able to return to places. Even if no teleportation will ever be available, we should be able to go back to \"that planet that was full of eridium\" the hard way.\n\n10. Proper planet rotation and solar system physics... The universe as it is made in no man's sky is full of solar systems that would crash on themselves. Also it's ridiculous to have the sun rotate the planets! The sun should be a real star and you should be able to fly to it.\n\nI believe that if those things were implemented, Hello games would have the game that set out to create in the first place 4 years ago. Maybe all that embarrassing deal with the negative emotions this game created was due to the fact that at some point the developing team realised that they could not implement all those things in time for release. Having said that, It's my humble opinion that if they plan to deliver on some of the features I mentioned above, it will take them really long .... looooong time... I don't expect those things to come to realisation for the next 3-4 years. And that is only if they plan to work hard and deliver.

{"body":"The way I see it, this attempts to solve the perceived shortcomings of two messaging solutions by merging their best parts.\n\nBelow I'll look at the traits of existing systems which are desirable or not for a development use-case.\n\n## Forums\nDesirable:\n\n* Forums are organised into conversation threads which have descriptive titles, are searchable, and enable parallel conversations to take place.\n* New threads can be created by any user to spark a fresh conversation.\n* You can freely browse threads without participating in any way, it subscribing to anything.\n* Forum posts can contain rich content like formatting, embedded images, etc.\n* You can subscribe to a thread that interests you, so you're notified in some way when a new post is made.\n\nUndesirable:\n\n* Traditional forum threads are not real-time. Even if a subscription notified you immediately of a new post, you still usually have to load/refresh a page to see it.\n* An individual forum post in a thread tends to have a lot of unnecessary chrome and metadata displayed, like user profile data, signature text/image, and sometimes even its own subject line.\n* One-line replies can be dwarfed by the visual noise surrounding them. This, along with long threads being paginated, also makes it hard to follow the conversation down the page.\n\nConclusion: Forums are best suited for longer-term discussions where the majority of posts in a conversation are relatively lengthy. They're great for browsing, and for finding old discussions later on.\n\nNote: I'm aware that Discourse resolves many of the issues raised here.\n\n## IM/Chat\n\nDesirable:\n\n* Real-time conversation.  Messages are seen as soon as they are sent, enabling rapid discussions.\n* Messages are usually presented in a clean, simple way with little surrounding chrome.\n* It's easy to follow the thread of a conversation without distractions - assuming only one conversation is currently occurring in a given group/channel.\n\nUndesirable:\n\n* Channels/group chats tend to be relatively static, and either have a fixed topic, or contain only members of a particular team/group.\n* This means that multiple discussions may occur simultaneously within a channel, making it harder to follow a conversation.\n* Individual discussions can't be easily isolated later for review, because a channel is a continuous, unending stream.\n* With protocol-based chats, you'll only receive messages sent while you were online (cloud-based chats fixes this).\n* You usually can't see conversations in a channel without joining it, and you may not be able to see messages sent before you joined.\n* Unless someone has joined all channels, they may miss discussions relevant to them.\n* If they are in all channels, they have to actively check them all to see if a relevant discussion is happening.\n* If they use notifications so they don't have to actively check, then they receive irrelevant notifications constantly, distracting them.\n\nConclusion: Great way to have a single real-time conversation upon a prescribed topic or within a team, as long as you aren't too bothered about finding the conversation later on. Also have utility for quickly sharing information or links to an entire team. However, these use cases don't match ours.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou have threads, like in a forum. People can make new ones for a topic. But when you open it, it basically contains a real-time chat channel. There's no join, you can just post, but you can subscribe if you want to actively follow the conversation or get relevant notifications. Once a discussion is over, you create a new topic for the next one. Therefore, each discussion becomes encapsulated in a searchable, categorisable form.\n\nThen take this solution and fine-tune it.\n\n/u/jacob_the_snacob, you must have gone through a thought process like this. Can you elaborate, nitpick, or otherwise comment?\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** Forums are cool but they suck. Chat is cool but it sucks.

Well, lets just give it best case input every time!\"\n\nThe reason worst-case input is often used in conjunction with big-O notation is because big-O notation describes an upper bound.

The first rank would fire, and then drop to a knee and start reloading. Then the second rank would do the same. And then the third. By the time the third had fired, the first rank would be reloaded and ready to fire again. Then they repeat this process. This ensured there would be an almost constant stream of fire down range. Now unless the orcs are already at very close range, they're not going to close that gap fast enough. And even if they do, they would be decimated, and most regulars were equipped with bayonets, and muskets were very effective clubs, so it's not like they're defenseless.\n\nYou want to go back to the 1600s or early 1700s to meet those requirements.","score":"19","subreddit":"whowouldwin"}

{"body":"\u0026gt;I am referring to elective abortion which encompass over 96% of those performed.\n\nI am also pro-life, but I have a qualm with this statement because it suggest that 96% of women getting abortions are doing it because it's just inconvenient or they just don't want it. And that is simply not true. For many women, they are forced into it by their spouse, family, or circumstances. My mother was forced by my step-father to have an abortion. She was not given a choice. I know women of extremely conservative families have been forced to have abortions to avoid scandal and the ruined reputation of their family. Lastly, and I think this is the vast majority of abortions, the conditions we have in the country for women who get pregnant with out a safety net or means of support feel trapped by their circumstances that they think they have no other option but to get the abortion.\n\nThis last reason is why I am pro-life but completely against trying to stop abortion by law. Those circumstances still remain and when you are backed into a corner, you will do anything to get out. In my state, when we passed a law restricting places to get abortions, the number of women who were coming into hospitals to get treated for complications from self-performed abortions shot up. Someone else on this thread posted a link to if banning abortion help lower abortion rates, and gave the example that Poland's number of abortions went down to 635. But then it points out that 5000-15000 Polish women had abortions outside the country. They are still doing it, just not legally in their own country.\n\nThis is why I am not merely anti-abortion, but pro-life. That entails creating a society where being pregnant isn't this horrific event, a society where your family will be okay supporting you, a society where even if you have no one you know to support you, the state will step in to support you. Studies show when you do this, abortion rates actually drop. The high school that I work at had a problem of girls at the school being faced with the decisions to abort or have the kid and drop out of school. So my school created a third option of having a daycare for their kids inside the school so the girls could go to school normally during the day, and then pick up their kids after school. All of a sudden, almost no abortions, and drastically dropped the number of girls dropping out because of pregnancies. It was no longer the end of the world.\n\nPeople are not not committing murder because there is a law against it, but because most see that harm and how unnecessary it is. That 96% of abortions will drop drastically if we change the mindset of society so that those women no longer see it as necessary.","score":"35","subreddit":"Christianity"}

{"body":"I'm not trying to argue the correctness of one point of view over the other, but it's not all that strange of an accusation. The West views Assad as a war criminal and his government largely illegitimate. Russia, Iran, and others view Assad as a bulwark against extremism in the region and are willing to overlook any crimes he might commit against his own people for the sake of maintaining his regime. To that end, the west differentiates between the moderate, anti-Assad rebels and the Islamic extremist rebels, while Russia does not.\n\nNot going to get into the validity of either viewpoint, but Russian airstrikes seem to be selectively targeting anti-Assad rebels over Islamist rebels. It has been reported that over [90%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/07/russia-airstrikes-syria-not-targetting-isis) of Russian airstrikes have not targeted ISIS, and have instead targeted US-backed moderate opponents of the Assad regime, which has strengthened his position, allowed him to maintain power, and further exacerbated the conflict.

However, as Mercy is supposed to be weak and requiring of defense from her teammates, flankers rarely expect her to pull out a gun and kill them.

I would argue there would need to be equal damage to necessitate equal coverage.

Feminism seeks to erode gender norms in general, which would naturally benefit men and women harmed by them.

You would have to do that while the walrus is slashing those massive yard-long tusks at you, all the while it is feeling highly motivated to protect its eyes. \n\nThe second flaw is your dental plan. Did you read the above section about \"hauling out\"? Walrus use their tusks to pull themselves up out of the ocean. They do this by slamming their tusks into ice or rock and heaving themselves up onto the land. Again they can weigh over 4000 lbs. Consider the force a 4000 lb. animal puts on those tusks by stabbing them into solid rock and then dragging its entire body weight. \n\nImagine climbing a flight of stairs with your teeth. That's how walrus do.  \n\nNow imagine how much force you can put on those tusks with your bare hands, just by tugging at them. You probably weigh what, 170 lb.? 200? 300?

{"body":"I think a better example is as follows (I am stealing this example from a thread I read back when the FBI released their statement)\n\nIgnorance of the law is no excuse, but ignorance of the activity you are engaging in can be.\n\nFor example: Transporting cocaine is illegal. Whether I know that or not, I will get in trouble for trafficking drugs. However, if I work for the USPS and deliver a package that (unbeknownst to me) had cocaine inside, I will not be charged. The reason being, I didn't know I was transporting cocaine. The distinction lies between \"I didn't know transporting cocaine was illegal,\" vs \"I didn't know I was transporting cocaine.\"\n\nNow, how does that relate to Clinton and the emails? Allegedly, Clinton did not know the emails contained classified information. If she **knowingly** sent classified information through a private server she could be charged. However if she, allegedly, didn't know the emails contained classified information (didn't know cocaine was in the package), there is no crime.","score":"57","subreddit":"changemyview"}

{"body":"*[[cont.]]*\n\nA consul stationed in Greece might convince the Senate that it wouldn't be needed to send a new consul and that he could wrap things up the next year as proconsul. The new consul might then be assigned Italy as province (fighting poor Gauls) while the proconsul in Greece could continue fighting a profitable war in the east. In some cases a consul would go so far as to start peacetalks and have a peace treaty at the ready. New consul gets sent to Greece? Quickly put the peace treaty to the Senate and end the war. New consul gets sent somewhere else and old consul can stay in Greece? Cancel peacetalks and continue the war. This stuff (and stuff like it) actually happened. Aristocratic rivalry had a huge effect on Roman expansion.\n\nTaking all of this together, what was behind Roman expansion? John Rich summarised it as \"Fear, Greed, and Glory\". Some wars of Rome (especially early on) were fought to defend against real or perceived threats. Many wars though were aggressive in nature, feeding the hunger for gold and glory in the Roman aristocracy and even the Roman citizens. (Legionaries too could get relatively rich from looting.) How, when and why certain areas were incorporated into the empire as a province (or not) is an entirely different beast but also is mostly influenced by economic considerations. If sufficient gold and grain can be extracted by demanding tribute, there's no need to incorporate the area. This is why Greece remained nominally free for two centuries after Rome first fought wars there, whereas Sicily and Sardinia were made a province almost immediately.\n\n------------------\n\n**Sources:** \n\nWorks mentioned:\n\n* S.P.

I mean, you can but you would be losing half of its efficiency. Might as well use SDG, even tho not everyone has access to it. \n\nAlso, one reason i would assume this medal is broken is because i would assume that the defense down debuff and attack up buff would be multiplied instead of added and that would make it slightly better than iTerra/iSora/iRiku.

You're right in that the fashion side of it was just as, if not more so, important than the music at its inception although it did go on to be more about the music once it hit the mainstream. \n\nNew Romantics always felt like a very forward-looking, optimistic trend. The fashion was daringly androgynous and spectacular, like an early 1970s sci-fi movie's idea of what the future would look like. The music relied heavily on the new synthesizers that were becoming available and which were used to produce a very clean and crisp sound. \n\nThis was in stark contrast to the harsher, grubbier, much more pessimistic tones of punk. With punk the future was urban decay and anarchy. The New Romantic future, on the other hand, was bright and shining albeit one that was possibly a bit cold and impersonal.\n\nI've always thought that the definitive New Romantic track was [Visage's Fade to Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMPC8QJF6sI). But that kind of \"pure\" New Romantic music didn't have a massive following or a particularly long life; it was softened somewhat to become New Wave which is where the likes of Duran Duran, early Simple Minds, Ultravox etc come in. That was much more commercially successful although still retaining the (generally) upbeat and future-looking aspect. \n","score":"26","subreddit":"LetsTalkMusic"}

Kurt angle makes six figures, when AJ Styles (The man who almost single handedly made TNA anything) asked for a raise to be similar to Kurt's she said No, then hired more people she couldn't afford and drove him away.\n\nPeople don't dislike her, it's the way she runs everything that we don't like and not as armchair bookers or dirt sheet readers, just the stuff she goes with people know doesn't work but she's too proud or stubborn to admit when what she does doesn't work.\n\nShe thinks TNA is this huge organization that should be bringing in WWE money without doing much work.","score":"39","subreddit":"SquaredCircle"}

Just like most food is edible past the expiration date, medications are, too. The difference is that medications don't spoil or go bad (assuming proper storage) like food does. However, they do lose potency. \n\nMedication expiration dates have a specific meaning: the manufacturer guarantees a specific level of the original potency (IIRC, this threshold is 90% potency) of the medication until that date. This is interesting because if you look at your prescription pill bottle, its expiration date will usually be for one year out; since it costs money to do that kind of testing, companies often only test for one year out and just apply for that period of time as the time before expiration. However, most medications retain their potency beyond their expiration and some even retain most of their potency for several years afterwards. \n\nPractically speaking, a drop in potency isn't a big deal for some medications (i.e. 85% potency vs 95% for OTC oral analgesics), while it is for others (i.e. medications to treat severe infections or to prevent seizures).","score":"56","subreddit":"YouShouldKnow"}

You don't need to keep it anyways, so stop being a **hoarder**.\n\nI get that there probably is a fine line on where to draw the size of vault space but since this expansion dropped, I've downsized my vault to under half of what it's been as I've accepted that it's necessary in order to accommodate all of the new items. I've deleted Halloween masks, raid gear, raid weapons, trials gear, SRL gear, godrolled Year 1 weapons, you name it. And still, the loot just keeps dropping and dropping (Exhibit A: Iron Banner), my vault and characters are full to the brim and I'm having to delete not only older stuff but a lot of the new stuff *before I even get to use it*. For every hour I spend in strikes, Archon Forge, the new raid, crucible, etc., I have to spend another 5-10 minutes running back and forth to my post master, the cryptarch and the vault and continuing the purge of gear.\n\nIn such a loot heavy game, we may not necessarily need a significant increase in our vault but we do need a new way of handling the flow of incoming new items without being forced to disregard what we've worked hard for the past 2 years.

{"body":"Here are his numbers for a typical \"perfect\" damage phase on Aksis: \n\n- Sleeper (9 shots, WITH WoL): 374,328\n- Raze Lighter (14 swings, NO WoL): 290,517\n- Dark Drinker (14ish swings, NO WoL): 397, 632\n\nSeems like Dark Drinker is the way to go, especially if you can get a WoL within melee range of the boss.
